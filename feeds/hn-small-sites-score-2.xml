            <div id="page">
                <p><span>Way back in April 2017, we announced we were going to take on HMRC’s</span> <a href="https://rebrand.ly/data-parliament-2017">failure to assess</a> <span>Uber to VAT which corroded public trust, not only in HMRC, but in politics more generally.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And itâ€™s been quite the scrap…Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There have been lows – like us spending the money we raised in the crowdfunder trying to get a protective costs order and failing.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And there have been highs – like us persuading the High Court </span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ewhc-2019"><span>late last year</span></a><span> that a fairly spineless HMRC was allowed to do what the legislation plainly allowed it to do and tell us it had (at last) assessed Uber.</span></p>
<p><span>There have been further lows – as last week when the Court of Appeal refused us permission to bring our judicial review against HMRC.</span></p>
<p><span><span>But ultimately </span><span>we triumphed</span><span>. </span></span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ussec-10q"><span>Uber’s US accounts</span></a><span> now confirm that HMRC has assessed Uber to VAT on fares – both prospectively and retrospectively.</span></p>
<p><span>And thatâ€™s all we ever wanted.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s been a long, bumpy (and expensive) ride – if you’ll allow me the metaphor – but we have reached our destination. I am so proud that together we have forced HMRC, belatedly, to act – </span><span>Uber has now been asked to pay the Â£1.5bn of tax they owe the public purse.</span></span></p>
<p><span>We couldnâ€™t have done it without your support. So thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>Iâ€™d also like to thank the lawyers – George Peretz QC, Jack Anderson, Hui Ling McCarthy QC, Christopher Knight, David Greene, Vikram Sachdeva QC, and Alex Rook – who helped out, most for even less than the smell of an oily rag, along the way.</span></p>

<p><span>It is only with your support that we can continue to hold Government to account. If you would like to make a donation, you can do so</span>Â&nbsp;<a href="https://goodlawproject.org/membership">here</a>.</p>

		With everything wired up correctly I could now control both an "up" relay and "down" relay via code.
	</p></section><section><div><h2>Height Sensors</h2><p>With the ability to raise and lower the desk via the relays (and code), I needed to think about how to actually control the desk and get it into a comfortable standing or sitting position automatically.</p><p>One easy approach is to simply raise or lower the desk for a certain amount of time. In other words, to get into the "standing" position just enable the "up" relay for 5 seconds. To go back to "sitting" enable the "down" relay for 5 seconds.</p><p>This doesn't really work though. The desk lowers much more quickly than it raises (due to gravity) so it's very hard to get the correct timings. Furthermore you can easily get out-of-sync, meaning you have to manually adjust the height again, making the whole endeavour pointless (of course I only realised this once I had assembled everything).</p><p>A better approach is to use a height sensor. These are small little devices that send out a sound wave and measure how long it takes to return. With some simple maths you have the height of the ground.<br></p></div></section><section><div><figure><img data-src="https://cdn.timmyomahony.com/assets/posts/sit-stand-controller/IMG_4499.f1602438374.jpg?mtime=20201011184543&amp;focal=none" alt="IMG 4499" title="IMG 4499" src="https://cdn.timmyomahony.com/assets/posts/sit-stand-controller/IMG_4499.f1602438374.jpg?mtime=20201011184543&amp;focal=none"><figcaption>

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>

<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generations don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub (haven't had the time to migrate yet), but nothing of my code is important what so ever, and I of course have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of Open Source code still reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture everything turns into crap? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the summer of 1986, Senator Al Gore, Jr., of Tennessee introduced an amendment to the Congressional Act that authorized the&nbsp; budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF). He called for the federal government to study the possibilities for “communications networks for supercomputers at universities and Federal research facilities.” To explain the purpose of this legislation, Gore called on a striking analogy:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One promising technology is the development of fiber optic systems for voice and data transmission. Eventually we will see a system of fiber optic systems being installed nationwide. America’s highways transport people and materials across the country. Federal freeways connect with state highways which connect in turn with county roads and city streets. T<em>o transport data and ideas,</em> <em>we will need a telecommunications highway connecting users coast to coast, state to state, city to city</em>. The study required in this amendment will identify the problems and opportunities the nation will face in establishing that highway.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>



<p>In the following years, Gore and his allies would call for the creation of an “information superhighway”, or, more formally, a national information infrastructure (NII). As he intended, Gore’s analogy to the federal highway system summons to mind a central exchange that would bind together various local and regional networks, letting all American citizens communicate with one another. However, the analogy also misleads – Gore did not propose the creation of a federally-funded and maintained data network. He envisioned that the information superhighway, unlike its concrete and asphalt namesake, would come into being through the action of market forces, within a regulatory framework that would ensure competition, guarantee open, equal access to any service provider (what would later be known as “net neutrality”), and provide subsidies or other mechanisms to ensure universal service to the least fortunate members of society, preventing the emergence of a gap between the information rich and information poor.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>Over the following decade, Congress slowly developed a policy response to the growing importance of computer networks to the American research community, to education, and eventually to society as a whole. Congress’ slow march towards an NII policy, however, could not keep up with the rapidly growing NSFNET, overseen by the neighboring bureaucracy of the executive branch. Despite its reputation for sclerosis, bureaucracy was created exactly because of its capacity, unlike a legislature, to respond to events immediately, without deliberation. And so it happened that, between 1988 and 1993, the NSF crafted the policies that would determine how the Internet became private, and thus went public. It had to deal every year with novel demands and expectations from NSFNET’s users and peer networks. In response, it made decisions on the fly, decisions which rapidly outpaced Congressional plans for guiding the development of an information superhighway. These decisions rested largely in the hands of a single man – Stephen Wolff.</p>



<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>



<p>Wolff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 1961 (where he would have been a rough contemporary of Bob Kahn), and began what might have been a comfortable academic career, with a post-doctoral stint at Imperial College, followed by several years teaching at Johns Hopkins. But then he shifted gears, and took a position&nbsp; at the Ballistics Research lab in Aberdeen, Maryland. He stayed there for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, researching communications and computing systems for the U.S. Army. He introduced Unix into the lab’s offices, and managed Aberdeen’s connection to the ARPANET.<sup>3</sup></p>



<p>In 1986, the NSF recruited him to manage the NSF’s supercomputing backbone – he was a natural fit, given his experience connecting Army supercomputers to ARPANET. He became the principal architect of NSFNET’s evolution from that point until his departure in 1994, when he entered the private sector as a manager for Cisco Systems. The original intended function of the net that Wolff was hired to manage had been to connect researchers across the U.S. to NSF-funded supercomputing centers. As we saw last time, however, once Wolff and the other network managers saw how much demand the initial backbone had engendered, they quickly developed a new vision of NSFNET, as a communications grid for the entire American research and post-secondary education community.</p>



<p>However, Wolff did not want the government to be in the business of supplying network services on a permanent basis. In his view, the NSF’s role was to prime the pump, creating the initial demand needed to get a commercial networking services sector off the ground. Once that happened, Wolff felt it would be improper for a government entity to be in competition with viable for-profit businesses. So he intended to get NSF out of the way by privatizing the network, handing over control of the backbone to unsubsidized private entities and letting the market take over.</p>



<p>This was very much in the spirit of the times. Across the Western world, and across most of the political spectrum, government leaders of the 1980s touted privatization and deregulation as the best means to unleash economic growth and innovation after the relative stagnation of the 1970s. As one example among many, around the same time that NSFNET was getting off the ground, the FCC knocked down several decades-old constraints on corporations involved in broadcasting. In 1985, it removed the restriction on owning print and broadcast media in the same locality, and two year later it nullified the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to present multiple views on public-policy debates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From his post at NSF, Wolff had several levers at hand for accomplishing his goals. The first lay in the interpretation and enforcement of the network’s acceptable use policy (AUP). In accordance with NSF’s mission, the initial policy for the NSFNET backbone, in effect until June 1990, required all uses of the network to be in support of “scientific research and other scholarly activities.” This is quite restrictive indeed, and would seem to eliminate any possibility of commercial use of the network. But Wolff chose to interpret the policy liberally. Regularly mailing list postings about new product releases from a corporation that sold data processing software – was that not in support of scientific research? What about the decision to allow MCI’s email system to connect to the backbone, at the urging of Vint Cerf, who had left government employ to oversee the development of MCI Mail. Wolff rationalized this – and other later interconnections to commercial email systems such as CompuServe’s – as in support of research by making it possible for researchers to communicate digitally with a wider range of people that they might need to contact in the pursuit of their work. A stretch, perhaps. But Wolff saw that allowing some commercial traffic on the same infrastructure that was used for public NSF traffic would encourage the private investment needed to support academic and educational use on a permanent basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wolff’s strategy of opening the door of NSFNET as far as possible to commercial entities got an assist from Congress in 1992, when Congressman Rick Boucher, who helped oversee NSF as chair of the Science Subcommittee, sponsored an amendment to the NSF charter which authorized any additional uses of NSFNET that would “tend to increase the overall capabilities of the networks to support such research and education activities.” This was an<em> ex post facto </em>validation of Wolff’s approach to commercial traffic, allowing virtually any activity as long as it produced profits that encouraged more private investment into NSFNET and its peer networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dual-Use Networks</h2>



<p>Wolff also fostered the commercial development of networking by supporting the regional networks’ reuse of their networking hardware for commercial traffic. As you may recall, the NSF backbone linked together a variety of not-for-profit regional nets, from NYSERNet in New York to Sesquinet in Texas to BARRNet in northern California. NSF did not directly fund the regional networks, but it did subsidize them indirectly, via the money it provided to labs and universities to offset the costs of their connection to their neighborhood regional net. Several of the regional nets then used this same subsidized infrastructure to spin off a for-profit commercial enterprise, selling network access to the public over the very same wires used for the research and education purposes sponsored by NSF. Wolff encouraged them to do so, seeing this as yet another way to accelerate the transition of the nation’s research and education infrastructure to private control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, too, accorded neatly with the political spirit of the 1980s, which encouraged private enterprise to profit from public largesse, in the expectation that the public would benefit indirectly through economic growth. One can see parallels with the dual-use regional networks in the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which defaulted ownership of patents derived from government-funded research to the organization performing the work, not to the government that paid for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most prominent example of dual-use in action was PSINet, a for-profit company initially founded as Performance Systems International in 1988. William Schrader and Martin Schoffstall, the co-founder of NYSERNet and one of vice presidents’, respectively, created the company. Schofstall, a former BBN engineer and co-author of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing the devices on an IP network, was the key technical leader. Schrader, an ambitious Cornell biology major and MBA who had helped his <em>alma mater </em>set up its supercomputing center and get it connected to NSFNET, provided the business drive. He firmly believed that …</p></div></div>

<p>Technology and Law Community “Masaar” documented the blocking of the Telegram website and application by the Egyptian authorities on 22 October 2020. The authorities blocked Telegram on three of the Internet service networks operating in Egypt. These networks included “We”, “Vodafone” and “Orange”. Masaar learned about the blocking action after complaints from several users of the Internet services on the three networks, stating that they cannot access the application or the website. It should be noted that Telegram is one of the most popular and widespread encrypted chat applications in the world.</p>
<p>Masaar confirms that users of the three networks: We (AS8452), Orange (AS24863) and Vodafone (AS36935) cannot use Telegram application on smartphones, as the Egyptian authorities have blocked access to IP addresses of the application.</p>
<p>The authorities also have blocked the Telegram website itself (telegram.org) and the version of Telegram used for desktop computers (web.telegram.org). Further, the blocking involved ADSL and mobile internet (4G / 3G).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that last September “Masaar” had <a href="https://masaar.net/en/blocked-websites-in-egypt/">published a web page declaring that the authorities have blocked 596 websites and 32 alternative links</a> since May 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Learn FFmpeg’s drawtext filter to dynamically overlay text on video and display information such as timecode, frame resolution, watermarks, etc. Also, let’s learn how to configure the font, font-size, position, background-color, alignment, multiple lines, etc. using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter.</strong></p>




<h2 id="step-0-ensure-your-ffmpeg-is-compiled-with-libfreetype"><span id="Step_0_Ensure_your_FFmpeg_Is_Compiled_with_libfreetype"></span>Step 0: Ensure your FFmpeg Is Compiled with libfreetype<span></span></h2>



<p>In order to use&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>, you needed to have configured FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfreetype</code>. As per the documentation, you need the following options as well if you want to,</p>



<ul><li>enable default font fallback and the font option you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfontconfig</code>.</li><li>enable the text_shaping option, you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfribidi</code>.</li></ul>



<h2 id="complete-list-of-options-for-drawtext"><span id="Complete_List_of_Options_for_drawtext"></span>Complete List of Options for drawtext<span></span></h2>



<p>The complete list of options for&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is far too much for me to explain here, but, if you have any questions, that is the first place you should refer.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk through several common use-cases that should make the concepts easy to understand.</p>



<h2 id="display-text-on-the-video-using-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Text_on_the_Video_using_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Text on the Video using drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the commandline and an explanation of the options</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='My text starting at 640x360':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here,</p>



<ul><li><code>inputClip.mp4</code>&nbsp;is the input video on which you want to display the text; and the output (containing the text) is to be stored in&nbsp;<code>output.mp4</code></li><li>no audio re-encoding as indicated by&nbsp;<code>-c:a copy</code></li><li>we use the drawtext filter as indicated by the commands&nbsp;<code>-vf "drawtext=........"</code></li><li><code>text='My text starting at 640x360'</code>&nbsp;is the text that will be shown on the video (you could make it your name for watermarking the video, right?)</li><li>position of the text<ul><li><code>x=640:y=360</code>&nbsp;indicates that the x and y coordinates as&nbsp;<code>640px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>360px</code>. Also, as a side note, the video’s resolution is&nbsp;<code>1280x720</code>.</li><li>font size is&nbsp;<code>24</code></li><li>font color is&nbsp;<code>white</code></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Let’s see how the output looks, shall we?</p>

<p>A better way to this is to offset the text by the length of the text that you are printing on the screen.</p>



<p>Confused?</p>



<p>If you look at the image above, you’ll see that it starts at the center of the video and extends towards the right.</p>



<p><strong>If you want to center the text itself, then you can subtract the height and width of the rendered text when telling&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;where to render the text.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s how. You use the command&nbsp;<code>x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2</code>&nbsp;and it will center the text. Here is our new commandline –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='Centered Text':x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Now, the text looks nice and pretty 🙂</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This produces an output like this – looks good right? You can play around with the&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;coordinates to align the text the way you want to.</p>

<ul><li><code>box</code>&nbsp;: this is either&nbsp;<code>1</code>&nbsp;(enabled) or&nbsp;<code>0</code>&nbsp;(disabled)</li><li><code>boxcolor:&nbsp;white@0.5</code>&nbsp;implies a white colored box with a 50% opacity.</li><li><code>boxborderw</code>&nbsp;is the width of the box’s border and the border color is taken from&nbsp;<code>boxcolor</code>.</li></ul>



<p>And there you have it, text with a background. In this example, I switched the color of the text to black so that it contrasts well with a light background bounding box (which in-turn contrasts well with a dark background.)</p>

<h2 id="displaying-timecodes--timestamps-using--ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Displaying_TimeCodes_/_TimeStamps_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Displaying TimeCodes / TimeStamps using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>This is a very useful application of the&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter and is used in demonstrating low-latency applications or visual quality testing so that one knows precisely what the timestamps/timecodes are at each time.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: hms}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This uses the&nbsp;<code>timestamp</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>pts</code>&nbsp;options to display time in hour:min:sec format using the&nbsp;<code>hms</code>&nbsp;format specifier. The notations and formatting are complex in my opion! So, a lot of trial and error might be needed before you format your display correctly.</p>



<p>Here is how the video looks. Hope Vimeo shows you the video without a lot of delay 🙂</p>

<p>And here is the same command, but using the&nbsp;<code>flt</code>&nbsp;option to provide microsecond time accuracy! Fancy 🙂</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: flt}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4

<h2 id="display-movie-credits-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Movie_Credits_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Movie Credits using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Finally, let’s learn how to show a movie’s credits using the draw text filter. Here are two main concepts that you need to understand.</p>



<ul><li>providing a lot of text: you can’t do this via the commandline, so, you need to read a text file that contains the text. And you can read that using the&nbsp;<code>textfile</code>&nbsp;option.</li><li>and, specify the speed of scrolling using the&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;text position. Here, you can provide an equation instead of a constant number. You start off by telling by FFmpeg that the y-position is&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t</code>&nbsp;so that everytime the value of time increases, the value of&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t*</code>&nbsp;decreases, and the text is displayed higher. Makes sense?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tip: change&nbsp;<code>80</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>120</code>&nbsp;and see the effect on the scrolling speed.</strong></p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=textfile=credits.txt: x=200: y=h-80*t: fontsize=36:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy outputCredits.mp4
</code></pre>



<p>Here is the output:</p>

<p>That’s it for this tutorial on using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter to produce dynamic overlays on your videos. It is a very versatile and handy tool that you can use to overlay text, timecodes, credits, copyrights notices on your videos.</p>

<p><strong><a name="desc" id="desc"></a>Description:</strong></p><p>

  This is a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine which uses wind energy to  drive things like an alternator/generator for producing electricity,  or air and water pumps for cooling, irrigation and similar.<br>
  The  turbine uses the 35-40% mechanically efficient Lenz2 lift+drag  design. It is made almost entirely from scrap materials, and should  cost about $15-$30 for the six vane version, which can be made by two  people in four hours without much effort. <br>
The three vane  version has been successfully survival tested to 80 km/h sustained  winds and the six vane version to 105 km. Both will do more, but  exactly how much has not yet been ascertained. The current longest  running version has been up since early 2014, through reasonable  storms, with no noticeable wear and tear as of yet.</p>
<iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oe6egO0YOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Full power curves have yet to be calculated for this  particular build, but according to Mr Ed Lenz's calculations a six  vane at 0.91 meters diameter and 1.1 meters high with a 90% efficient  alternator should produce at least 130 watts of electricity in a 30  km/h wind, and 1 kilowatt at 60 km/h. </p><p>
The materials  listed in this tutorial are to make the three vane version. Double  everything except the bike wheel for six vanes.

              </strong>Exactly how  bike wheels are measured is slightly complicated, basically you want  one which is about 58cm total outer rim diameter, give or take. <br>
              The  wheel should:<br>
              ~ Not be quick release <br>
              ~ Have a normal thick  axle (about 10mm diameter)<br>
              ~ Have 36 spokes<br>
              ~ Run reasonably  smoothly <br>
              ~ Have enough axle showing to attach to your pole  mount, at least 3-4cm.<br>
            ~ Only needs gears if you're going to be running a chain off them, which you probably aren't.</p>              <p>It may be helpful to take the wheel  hub apart using spanners and a bike cone spanner and give the  bearings a bit of a clean and re-grease, and to extend the axle as  much as possible on one side for attaching. If you've not done this  before take it along to your local bike servicing place and they'll  be happy to show you how. Shouldn't be necessary tho if the wheel  runs nicely enough and has enough axle showing.</p></td>

<strong>Step by step build instructions:</strong></p>
<p>These relate to the animation to the left. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
  Download and print the two template  files from the links above. Make sure they're printed at 100% (200  dpi). When printed measure the distance between the dimension arrows,  it should be 10cm on both pages. If it's a couple mm off that's  probably ok.</p>
<p>Tape the pages together so that the 10cm dimension marks overlap  as closely as possible. Best way to do this is on a window pane  during the day, so you can see both pages showing through.<br>
  With  a craft knife and the angle aluminium as a straight edge, cut out the  outer border of the template.<br>
  Any time you're cutting, always  make sure your other hand is never in front of the knife, so if you  slip you're not going to slice yourself. The angle aluminium is good  for this, as the vertical bit effectively shields the hand holding  it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and measure a box 42cm x 48cm. Draw a line half way up the 48cm  length so you have two boxes measuring 42cm x 24cm. Score the outer  lines with the Stanley knife and straight edge. You're not trying to  cut through the metal, just create a line that can then be popped out  later. A good method is to score once lightly, then a second time a  bit deeper.<br>
  Do not score the 24cm halfway line.</p>
<p>Flex the metal so that it bends at a score line, then flex back  the other way. Do this a couple times and it should split. Do the  same for the other score and remove the outer metal. Keep it for  later. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tape the template to the  metal rectangle (from now on to be referred to as a 'former') so that  the long edge of the paper sits on the middle line and the right hand  edges of both line up. Don't worry if the other edges don't align  perfectly.</p>
<p>With blade and straight edge, score out the template curve,  including the triangles at each end. It's not essential that this be  100% perfect, but try to get the first one reasonably nice as you can  then use it as a template for the rest.</p>
<p>Score, flex, and remove the two triangles of metal outside the  template.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Mark the centers of the  little circles on the paper template with a marker pen so that  they're visible from the other side and flip the paper over so that  the printed side is down on the other half of the former, keeping the  long edge on the middle line. Retape so it doesn't shift.<br>
  Give  the curved score a couple of flexes and tear it out. Remove the two  small triangles. Be careful not to bend the unscored metal too much  as you're doing this as it may weaken it.</p>
<p>You now have your first former. Repeat steps 2 through 3 so that  you have a total of 6 formers. You can use the first former as a  cutting template rather than the paper. On three of the formers have  the 24cm line drawn on the front, the other three on the back.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take all six formers and peg them together  so that they are as nicely aligned as possible.<br>
  Use tape to  attach them if you don't have clothes pegs. </p>
<p>Drill each of the 16 holes through all six formers with a 4mm bit.  Drill the center hole first, as this is the only one that needs to be  reasonably accurate. It can help to put a bolt through that first  hole to keep the formers from shifting around as you drill.</p>
<p>If the holes on your template are laid out a little differently  than those in the animation it'll be because the template is more  up to date.</p>
<p>Remove the template and unpeg the formers.<br>
  Place a former  with the 24cm line slightly overhanging the edge of the table. Place  the straight edge on the middle line and bend up to 90 degrees.  Repeat with all six, with three formers bent shiny side up and three  bent shiny side down. <br>
  Put the formers aside. </p>
<p><strong>6</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and flatten out any bends in the metal. Cut the long edge down to  67cm.</p>
<p>Draw a line 2cm from one of the 67cm edges, flip the sheet over  and draw another line 2cm from the opposite edge on the other side of  the metal.</p>
<p>repeat with 2 more sheets and peg all 3 together so that each  drawn line is aligned to the edge of the sheet above it.</p>
<p>Mark the edge at 4cm, 6, 8, 10, 18, 26, 34, and then every 2cm up  to and including 64cm<br>
  Keep in mind that one side has a score at  4cm from the edge, the other at 3cm.</p>
<p>Flip the sheets over, making sure they don't lose their alignment.  Mark and score the same as the first edge. Make sure both have the  4cm gap on the same edge.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tap the sheets on the  table so that they are aligned on top of each other.<br>
  From the  4cm end draw a vertical line at 19cm from the edge, and one at 33cm  from the edge.<br>
  Mark each line at 3cm and 20cm from both ends.</p>
<p>Drill all 3 sheets with 4mm holes at all 8 marks. If you're  making a six vane turbine rather than three you can drill all six  sheets at once as easily.<br>
  Unpeg the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>8:</strong><br>
  Place a sheet so that the second 3cm edge is  overhanging the table. Place the straight edge on …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>
    Recent work by Dabney et al. suggests that the brain represents reward predictions as probability distributions
    <d-footnote>
      Experiments were conducted on mice using single-unit recordings from the ventral tegmental area.
    </d-footnote><d-cite key="dabney2020distribtionmice"></d-cite>.
    This contrasts against the widely adopted approach in reinforcement learning (RL) of modelling single scalar
    quantities (expected values).
    In fact, by using distributions we are able to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making process.
    Uncertainty is especially important in domains where making a mistake can result in the inability to recover
    <d-footnote>
      Examples of such domains include autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and the financial markets.
    </d-footnote>. Research in risk-aware reinforcement learning has emerged to address such problems
    <d-cite key="morimura2010risksensitive,chow2018riskconstrainedrl"></d-cite>.
    However, another important application of uncertainty, which we focus on in this article, is efficient exploration
    of the state-action space.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this article is to clearly explain Q-Learning from the perspective of a Bayesian.
    As such, we use a small grid world and a simple extension of tabular Q-Learning to illustrate the fundamentals.
    Specifically, we show how to extend the deterministic Q-Learning algorithm to model
    the variance of Q-values with Bayes' rule. We focus on a sub-class of problems where it is reasonable to assume that Q-values
    are normally distributed
    and derive insights when this assumption holds true. Lastly, we demonstrate that applying Bayes' rule to update
    Q-values comes with a challenge: it is vulnerable to early exploitation of suboptimal policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This article is largely based on the seminal work from Dearden et al. <d-cite key="dearden1998bayesianqlearning"></d-cite>.
    Specifically, we expand on the assumption that Q-values are normally distributed and evaluate various Bayesian exploration
    policies. One key distinction is that we model $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, while the
    authors of the original Bayesian Q-Learning paper model a distribution over these parameters. This allows them to quantify
    uncertainty in their parameters as well as the expected return - we only focus on the latter.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty</h4></div>
  <div><p>
    Since Dearden et al. model a distribution over the parameters, they can sample from this distribution and the resulting
    dispersion in Q-values is known as <b>epistemic</b> uncertainty. Essentially, this uncertainty is representative of the
    "knowledge gap" that results from limited data (i.e. limited observations). If we close this gap, then we are left with
    irreducible uncertainty (i.e. inherent randomness in the environment), which is known as <b>aleatoric</b> uncertainty
    </p><d-cite key="kiureghian2007aleatoric"></d-cite><p>.

    </p><p>
    One can argue that the line between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is rather blurry. The information that
    you feed into your model will determine how much uncertainty can be reduced. The more information you incorporate about
    the underlying mechanics of how the environment operates (i.e. more features), the less aleatoric uncertainty there will be.

    </p><p>

    It is important to note that inductive bias also plays an important role in determining what is categorized as
    epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty for your model.
    </p><p>

    <b>Important Note about Our Simplified Approach:</b></p><p>

    Since we only use $$\sigma^2$$ to represent uncertainty, our approach does not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

    Given enough interactions, the agent will close the knowledge gap and $$\sigma^2$$ will only represent aleatoric uncertainty. However, the agent still
    uses this uncertainty to explore.

    This is problematic because the whole point of exploration is to gain
    knowledge, which indicates that we should only explore using epistemic uncertainty.
    </p></div>


  

  <p>
    Since we are modelling $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, we begin by evaluating the conditions under which it is appropriate
    to assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  <a href="#section-1" id="section-1"></a>
  <h2>When Are Q-Values Normally Distributed?</h2>

  <p>
    The readers who are familiar with Q-Learning can skip over the collapsible box below.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Temporal Difference Learning</h4></div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Temporal Difference (TD) learning is the dominant paradigm used to learn value functions in reinforcement learning
      <d-cite key="sutton1988tempdiff"></d-cite>.
      Below we will quickly summarize a TD learning algorithm for Q-values,
      which is called Q-Learning. First, we will write Q-values as follows <d-cite key="Sutton2017ReinforcementIntroduction"></d-cite>:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \overbrace{Q_\pi(s,a)}^\text{current Q-value} =
      \overbrace{R_s^a}^\text{expected reward for (s,a)} +
      \overbrace{\gamma Q_\pi(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})}^\text{discounted Q-value at next timestep}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      We will precisely define Q-value as the expected value of the total return from taking action $$a$$ in state $$s$$ and following
      policy $$\pi$$ thereafter. The part about $$\pi$$ is important because the agent's view on how good an action is
      depends on the actions it will take in subsequent states. We will discuss this further when analyzing our agent in
      the game environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Q-Learning algorithm, we sample a reward $$r$$ from the environment, and estimate the Q-value for the current
      state-action pair $$q(s,a)$$ and the next state-action pair $$q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})$$
      <d-footnote>
        For Q-Learning, the next action $$a^{\prime}$$ is the action with the largest Q-value in that state:
        $$\max_{a^{\prime}} q(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime})$$.
      </d-footnote>. We can represent the sample as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) = r + \gamma q{(s^\prime,a^\prime)}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The important thing to realize is that the left side of the equation is an estimate (current Q-value), and the right side
      of the equation is a combination of information gathered from the environment (the sampled reward) and another estimate
      (next Q-value). Since the right side of the equation contains more information about the true Q-value than the left side,
      we want to move the value of the left side closer to that of the right side. We accomplish this by minimizing the squared
      Temporal Difference error ($$\delta^2_{TD}$$), where $$\delta_{TD}$$ is defined as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \delta_{TD} = r + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime) - q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The way we do this in a tabular environment, where $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate, is with the following update rule:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) \leftarrow \alpha(r_{t+1} + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime)) + (1 - \alpha) q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      Updating in this manner is called bootstrapping because we are using one Q-value to update another Q-value.
    </p>
  </div>

  

  <p>
    We will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) as the foundation to understand when Q-values are normally
    distributed. Since Q-values are sample sums, then they should look more and more normally distributed as the sample size
    increases <d-cite key="lecam1986clt"></d-cite>.
    However, the first nuance that we will point out is that rewards must be sampled from distributions with finite variance.
    Thus, if rewards are sampled distributions such as Cauchy or Lévy, then we cannot assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    Otherwise, Q-values are approximately normally distributed when the number of <b><i>effective timesteps</i></b>
    $$\widetilde{N}$$ is large
    <d-footnote>
      We can think of effective timesteps as the number of <b>full</b> samples.
    </d-footnote>.
    This metric is comprised of three factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      $$N$$ - <b>Number of timesteps</b>: As $$N$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\xi$$ - <b>Sparsity</b>: We define sparsity as the number of timesteps,
      on average, a reward of zero is deterministically received in between receiving non-zero rewards
      <d-footnote>
        In the Google Colab notebook, we ran simulations to show that $$\xi$$ reduces the effective number of timesteps by $$\frac{1}{\xi + 1}$$:
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/brandinho/bayesian-perspective-q-learning/blob/main/Sparsity.ipynb">
          Experiment in a <span>Notebook</span>
        </a>
      </d-footnote>.
      When sparsity is present, we lose samples (since they are always zero).
      <!-- As sparsity increases, we essentially lose samples since they are always zero. -->
      Therefore, as $$\xi$$ increases, $$\widetilde{N}$$ decreases.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\gamma$$ - <b>Discount Factor</b>:
      As $$\gamma$$ gets smaller, the agent places more weight on immediate rewards relative to distant ones, which means
      that we cannot treat distant rewards as full samples. Therefore, as $$\gamma$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <div><h4>Discount Factor and Mixture Distributions</h4></div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We will define the total return as the sum of discounted future
        rewards, where the discount factor $$\gamma$$ can take on any value between $$0$$ (myopic) and $$1$$ (far-sighted).
        It helps to think of the resulting distribution $$G_t$$ as a weighted mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <d-math block="">
        G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + ... + \gamma^{N-1} r_{t+N}
      </d-math>

      <p>
        When we set $$\gamma \lt 1$$, the mixture weights for the underlying distributions change from equal weight
        to time-weighted, where immediate timesteps have a higher weight. When $$\gamma = 0$$, then this is
        equivalent to sampling from only one timestep and CLT would not hold. Use the slider
        to see the effect $$\gamma$$ has on the mixture weights, and ultimately the mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
              $$$$<br>

      </div>

      <p><label for="barGammaMixture">$$\gamma$$ = <span></span></label></p>
    </div>
  </ul>

  We combine the factors above to formally define the number of effective timesteps:

  <d-math block="">
    \widetilde{N} = \frac{1}{\xi + 1}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\gamma^{i}
  </d-math>

  <p>
    Below we visually demonstrate how each factor affects the normality of Q-values
    <d-footnote>
      We scale the Q-values by $$\widetilde{N}$$ because otherwise the distribution of Q-values
      moves farther and farther to the right as the number of effective timesteps increases, which distorts the visual.
    </d-footnote>:

        <h3>2020-05-11</h3>

<p>A couple weekends ago, I found myself with the desire to fetch oil and gas production data for a specific county in New Mexico from the <a href="http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/OCD/">New Mexico Oil Conservation Division</a> (OCD).</p>
<p>Fortunately, the OCD provides access to historical well production via an FTP server. I worked out that I needed to download <code>/Public/OCD/OCD Interface v1.1/volumes/wcproduction/wcproduction.zip</code>… and then my fortune ran out.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was the file size. The OCD doesn’t seem to provide a way to query a limited time- or area-based subset of production history data, so we’re stuck with a single zip file for “all of New Mexico since the dawn of time”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The result is a whopping 712MB ZIP file.</p>
<p>Here’s where I knew I was in trouble: the only thing inside was a single 38 GB file called <code>wcproduction.xml</code>.</p>
<h3>“XML is like violence: when it fails, apply more”</h3>
<p>XML—the “extensible markup language”. Along with Java’s <code>AbstractBeanFactoryTemplateFactory</code>s, and the entirety of Geocities, XML epitomizes the excesses of the late 90s and early 2000s computing culture.</p>
<p>No two parsers can ever quite seem to agree on the details, and the verbosity quotient is such that an attempt to “print source” for the average “XHTML” web site circa 2001 would be likely to completely deforest the Amazon. The one thing that can be said in its favor is that it can indeed be used to somewhat faithfully represent a tree (the in-memory hierarchical structure, not the thing we just killed millions of).</p>
<p>Enough griping, though: the “XML everywhere” wave has long subsided. We’ve got to figure out how to deal with what it left behind. While it’s the most common approach to parsing XML, it’s also clear that loading the entire file into memory is unlikely to work: the workstation I’m writing this on only has 32GB of RAM. Additionally, it doesn’t make sense to build a syntax tree for the entire document when we are only interested in a small subset of the data. The XML world refers to this—here, unworkable—approach as a “DOM parser”, but it’s just the common case of parsing for any formal language—we incrementally construct an in-memory representation (that is, a syntax tree) of an entire document. It works well when we need the entire result and the in-memory representation fits comfortably within our resource budget: for instance, when compiling computer programs from source code, or rendering a web page from HTML.</p>
<p>Instead, we’ll use a streaming approach (the XML folks call this “SAX”, for reasons I didn’t care enough to research). In this approach, we’ll parse the document incrementally and receive results via an event-based API. This will let us only handle the data we care about, and minimize the amount we need to keep in memory at once.</p>
<p>For good performance on this “huge” data set, and to leverage an easily-accessible ecosystem of libraries which includes both streaming ZIP archive handling and high-performance streaming XML parsers, we’ll write a data extraction program in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> programming language.</p>
<h3>(Re)Write It In Rust</h3>
<p><img alt="Rust Evangelism Strike Force logo" width="400px" src="http://usethe.computer/images/resf.png"></p>
<p>I’m not going to belabor the reasons Rust is exciting here. It’s a statically-typed, compiled language with a nice mix of performance and control, expressiveness, and safety. I find it to be a nice choice for the sorts of “systems programming” tasks in which I might also use C or C++, but the build tools and package management system (<a href="https://crates.io/">Cargo</a>) also make it a viable choice for these sorts of “script-like” programs, especially when performance may be an issue.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by creating a new Rust project using Cargo. We want a program (binary), not a library:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new ocd_production --bin</code></pre>
<p>That’ll create a new directory <code>ocd_production</code> containing a Rust project. Inside we have a “hello world” program in <code>src/main.rs</code> and a specification for the project in <code>Cargo.toml</code>. The directory is also a <code>git</code> repository, which is handy.</p>
<p>There’s no sense in unpacking the ZIP file when we can stream our XML file out of it using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/zip"><code>zip</code></a> library. Let’s begin by just previewing the text of the XML file.</p>
<p>We’ll add <code>zip</code> to our <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[package]
name = "ocd_production"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Derrick W. Turk &lt;dwt@terminusdatascience.com&gt;"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
zip = "0.5.5"</code></pre>
<p>A caveat before we begin: this is going to be “script” quality code. My goal is to process one file quickly and reliably, not to build a reusable library or produce “production-ready” code. As such, this code is going to skip some “best practices”: everything will be in one long <code>main.rs</code> file, and error handling will be oriented toward catching error conditions and aborting the program rather than toward error recovery or human-friendly error messages.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s write a short program in <code>src/main.rs</code> to take a ZIP file path as a command-line argument, and stream a few KB at a time from the file contained inside:</p>
<pre id="cb3"><code><a id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span>use</span> std::<span>{</span></a>

<a id="cb3-35" data-line-number="35"><span>}</span></a></code></pre>
<p>We’ll compile in “release mode” (that is, with optimizations enabled) and run against the ZIP file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --release wc_production.zip</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><code>file is wcproduction.xml, size 38535541060 bytes</code><br>
<code>Error: Utf8Error { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) }</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s discouraging.</p>
<h3>Only 90s Kids Will Remember This File Encoding</h3>
<p>Like many “modern” languages, Rust’s standard string type is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> encoded <a href="https://home.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> string. This is the right answer for a <a href="https://utf8everywhere.org/">lot of good reasons</a>, but it’s only become popular in recent years.</p>
<p>In this case, we’ve clearly encountered some text which is not encoded in UTF-8. In fact, we’ve hit an invalid byte as the very first byte. Let’s look at raw bytes, rather than Rust strings, so that we can see what’s going on. We’ll edit <code>src/main.rs</code>:</p>

<p>At this point, recovering Windows programmers and Java programmers are wincing in sympathy. Two things immediately stand out: first, we’ve got a series of bytes alternating between the printable ASCII range and zero, and second, we open with <code>0xFF 0xFE</code>—that’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">BOM</a>. We’re dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</a> byte order.</p>
<p>If you want the short version of how we got here, I suggest reading <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-11/">Chapter 11 of the Book of Genesis</a>.</p>
<p>The slightly longer version goes like this: in the late 80s, some forward-thinking folks began thinking seriously about the fact that non-Americans were using computers. In fact, some of the world’s computer users weren’t even Europeans, who could usually get away with smuggling some funny accented Latin characters into that “unused” eighth bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>. Of course, the non-Latin alphabet folks were doing just fine on their own: they had their own character sets and encodings.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be nice if we could all share one universal character set? Some sort of… “Uni”versal “code”? Surely, they reasoned, the Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) character sets, the Latin alphabet, the Cyrillic alphabet, and anything else of interest could all be encoded into a shared 16-bit range. 65,536 characters should be enough for all the world’s languages! We’d just decide that the new “character type” was a 16-bit integer instead of an 8-bit integer; strings could still be arrays of these characters, and doubling the storage required for existing ASCII text was an acceptable price to pay for global harmony. Big names committed to this new “Universal Character Set” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set">UCS-2</a>): Microsoft rebuilt Windows’ string handling to use strings of two-byte UCS-2 “wide characters”, and the hot new Java programming language made the same decision.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, 65,536 characters did not turn out to be nearly enough for all the world’s languages—much less the wave of weird 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 characters 💯 yet to 🔜 appear. Unicode ended up adopting a 32-bit address space, supporting over 4 billion characters. We’re unlikely to fill that any time soon, even given the breathtaking pace of emoji creation.</p>
<p>However, it also …</p></div></div>

    <p>I have few frustrations with the way my computer science degree is taught, but my biggest by far has 
been the conspicuous lack of practical skills such as Git.</p>
<p>I understand this is partly by design, because it's a computer science degree and not a software 
engineering degree, but only 1 or 2 months in, you start being assigned group projects that pretty 
much require version control. I've also heard this complaint about computer science degrees before, 
so with that in mind, here's a crash course.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="goals-assumptions">
<a href="#goals-assumptions" aria-label="Anchor link for: goals-assumptions">##</a>

Goals &amp; Assumptions</h2>
<p>My goal with this crash course is to get you to the point where you can contribute to a pair or 
group project effectively. I'm not aiming for you to understand the inner workings of Git, but it's 
important that I explain enough for you to build a basic mental model.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm going to assume that you understand how to navigate in the terminal (using commands such as 
<code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some point, I'll write a tutorial on this too and link to it here, but for now you'll have 
to fend for yourself (sorry).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're on Windows, I'm going to use Unix terminology and assume that you can translate as 
needed; sorry about that, but I'm not well-versed enough with the Windows developer ecosystem to 
do that. As far as I understand, if you're using Git Bash or WSL, you don't need to worry about 
this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm very open to <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Enerosnm/neros.dev">patches</a> or 
<a href="mailto:soren@neros.dev">emails</a> that correct this paragraph if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="version-control">
<a href="#version-control" aria-label="Anchor link for: version-control">##</a>

Version Control</h2>
<h3 id="what">
<a href="#what" aria-label="Anchor link for: what">###</a>

What</h3>
<p>Version control has two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping track of changes that are made to files.</li>
<li>Integrating together changes made by multiple people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Git is the version control software that's most commonly used by software developers, and with good 
reason; when Git came around, it was able to replace a lot of other tools that are now widely 
regarded as having been much harder to use and more error-prone.</p>
<p>Lots of other software that you might have used has version control features, to more or less of an 
extent (e.g. Google Docs and Microsoft Word). Google Docs is a particularly visible example; 
multiple people can edit the same document at the same time and all of their changes are kept, and 
it does have a version history.</p>
<h3 id="why">
<a href="#why" aria-label="Anchor link for: why">###</a>

Why</h3>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking that another piece of software to do this is unnecessary, or an 
inconvenience. You might be thinking that you've been getting by just fine until now. In that case, 
here are just a few of the reasons why I think learning Git is worth the effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It provides a version history. If something breaks, you can search back through that history 
easily and find out exactly what change broke it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can merge changes made by multiple people. Once you've learned how to use basic Git, there's 
almost no extra effort required to learn how to merge changes, which, in most cases, can be done 
without requiring you to do any manual editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It stores authorship information. If you were taught to add comments to the top of files with your 
name in them, guess what? You won't have to do that anymore. Git can tell you who authored every 
single <em>line</em> of every file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's an industry standard. Most software engineering jobs will require you to know how to use it, 
or will train you on it immediately, because it's considered essential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, if I applied for a job and they didn't consider Git essential and require me to 
know how to use it, I would consider that a red flag.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">
<a href="#getting-started" aria-label="Anchor link for: getting-started">##</a>

Getting Started</h2>
<p>With that out of the way, let's start by <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">installing 
<code>git</code></a>. Once you've done that, make 
sure you configure your authorship information:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git config --global user.name </span><span>"Your Name"
</span><span>$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>You might also want to configure which editor Git should use. The default (if you haven't set up a 
default editor with <code>$EDITOR</code>) is probably <code>vim</code>, which could be frustrating if you don't know how 
to use it. For example, you could set the editor to Visual Studio Code:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git config --global core.editor </span><span>"code --wait"
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can find more information about first-time setup <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">here</a>, and information about setting 
your text editor <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="repositories">
<a href="#repositories" aria-label="Anchor link for: repositories">##</a>

Repositories</h2>
<p>Git works by designating a particular folder as a "repository", which means that it will track 
changes to any files in that folder or its children.</p>
<p>I'll put commands throughout this article that you should run to follow along. To start, create a 
folder, move inside, and designate it as a Git repository:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ mkdir git-crash-course
$ cd git-crash-course
$ git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/soren/src/localhost/git-crash-course/.git/
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>git</code> has created a folder called <code>.git/</code> inside <code>git-crash-course/</code>. This is where it will store 
information about the history of changes you've made to the contents of this repository.</p>
<h2 id="changes">
<a href="#changes" aria-label="Anchor link for: changes">##</a>

Changes</h2>
<p>In order to understand how Git tracks changes, we need to actually make some changes first. Create a 
file at the root of the repository with some text in it:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo </span><span>"Hello, world!" </span><span>&gt;</span><span> foo.txt
$ ls -a
./       ../      .git/    foo.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>When you make changes to a file in a repository and then run <code>git</code>, it compares the state of the 
files with their state at a specific point in the past. You can ask about what changes it sees:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use </span><span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to include in what will be committed)
        foo.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use </span><span>"git add"</span><span> to track)
</span></code></pre>
<p>There's a lot of information here, but what we care about is the section starting with "Untracked 
files". Git is telling us that it sees a file (foo.txt) that hasn't yet had any changes recorded. 
Because it hasn't seen this file before, it's labelled as untracked. To start tracking it, we need 
to create a <strong>commit</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="commits">
<a href="#commits" aria-label="Anchor link for: commits">##</a>

Commits</h2>
<p>A commit is simply a bundle of changes, packaged up together and given a message to describe what 
those changes represent. This is the basic unit of organisation in Git's model of changes.</p>
<p>Let's create a commit for the change we made. The first thing to do is designate which changes to 
include in the commit:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git add foo.txt
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use </span><span>"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to unstage)
        new file:   foo.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, the changes we made to <code>foo.txt</code> have been designated as "to be committed", more commonly 
referred to as "staged". Only changes that are staged will be included when we create a commit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be precise, the change that's been staged is the creation of the file <code>foo.txt</code> with its 
current contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let's create a commit to package up those changes and describe them:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git commit -m </span><span>"Add foo.txt"
</span><span>[master (root-commit) ffbbc5a] Add foo.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 foo.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>We've used the <code>-m</code> flag to provide a message describing the commit. Convention dictates that 
commits are phrased in the <em>imperative</em> tense. In other words, say "add foo.txt", not "added 
foo.txt" or "adds foo.txt".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This makes more sense if you think about the history of commits in a repository as describing the 
steps required to go from an empty folder to one containing all of the files in their current 
state. From that perspective, each commit is an <em>instruction</em> to Git to perform one of those steps 
in the change history: so we tell Git <em>to add</em> foo.txt, rather than telling it <em>that we added</em> 
foo.txt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we run <code>git status</code> again, we see that now all the changes have been committed, we have what's 
called a "clean working tree": there aren't any changes in any files that haven't been committed.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's make a couple more commits. First, add a second file:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo </span><span>"See foo.txt for a message!" </span><span>&gt;</span><span> bar.txt
$ git add bar.txt
$ git commit -m </span><span>"Add some instructions"
</span><span>[master 18e31b4] Add some instructions
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 bar.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, make some changes to an existing file, and notice the different output of <code>git status</code> after 
you make the change:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo </span><span>"Here's another line." </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> foo.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use </span><span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to update what will be committed)
  (use </span><span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   foo.txt

no changes added to commit (use </span><span>"git add"</span><span> and/or </span><span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>You'll notice this time that the changes are marked as "not staged for commit", rather than having 
files listed as "untracked". That's because Git is comparing the current state of our files to the 
last commit, and since <code>foo.txt</code> already existed in the last commit, it recognises that all we're 
doing is changing some lines inside the file.</p>
<p>If you want to see exactly what those changes are, run <code>git diff</code>, and you'll see something like 
this:</p>
<pre><code><span>diff --git a/foo.txt b/foo.txt
index af5626b..bdfc7b8 100644
</span><span>---</span><span> a/foo.txt
</span><span>+++</span><span> b/foo.txt
</span><span>@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Hello, world!
</span><span>+</span><span>Here's another line.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now stage and commit this.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git add .
$ git commit -m </span><span>"Update foo.txt"
</span><span>[master ed1fa47] Update foo.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can pass <code>git add</code> a path instead of individual filenames to add all changes in the folder at 
that path. …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<p>Learn how to securely tunnel smart phone traffic
over a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> VPN with an
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> 6.8 endpoint using the newly
released in-kernel <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.8/wg">wg(4)</a>
driver with only base utilities.</p>

<h2 id="why-tunnel-internet-traffic">Why tunnel internet traffic?</h2>
<p>When you browse the internet, check emails, use social media, etc. on
your laptop or smart phone, the traffic must go from your device, through
the local network, then through the wider internet until it ultimately
reaches the destination server. Whoever runs the local Wi-Fi or cell
network can see what websites you visit, and if the connection to the
website is not encrypted, exactly what you are sending and receiving
from the site. Further, if the Wi-Fi network is not encrypted (an open
insecure network with no password), then any user on the network can
also read your traffic!</p>
<p>One way to keep your browsing and activity private and secured
from the people on the local network is to tunnel it through an
encrypted Virtual Private Network (VPN). I commonly do this when
using public Wi-Fi at airports, libraries, restaurants, etc. to
secure my internet traffic from potential eavesdroppers. Ways to
obtain a VPN include buying one from a commercial VPN provider, but
this shifts the issue of who can look at your traffic from people
on the Wi-Fi to this provider. Instead, I setup my own VPN (using
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a>) on a virtual private server
(VPS) that I own on <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a> that runs on
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, my favorite operating system.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-wireguard">What is WireGuard?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> is becoming the go-to software
to create a VPN. Compared to common alternatives (OpenVPN, IPsec) it
is simpler, faster, and uses modern cryptography (making it arguably
more secure). OpenBSD has had user-land support for WireGuard using
<a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard-go/about/">WireGuard-go</a>. OpenBSD 6.8
was released today (2020-10-18) and now includes an in-kernel WireGuard
implementation <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.8/wg">wg(4)</a>. Being
in-kernel, this implementation is faster. It also means we can skip
using extra software and use base-only utilities for simple, easy
configuration.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-things-look-like-at-the-end">What will things look like at the end?</h2>
<p>Your smart phone will enable the VPN through one-click on the WireGuard
app. All traffic on your phone will then go over an encrypted tunnel to
the OpenBSD endpoint server, after which, it will route to the rest of
the internet. This will protect your traffic from anyone snooping on the
Wi-Fi or cell network.</p>

<p>Below shows configuration for an OpenBSD server to be a WireGuard
endpoint. All instructions below pertain to OpenBSD 6.8 released on
2020-10-18.</p>
<h2 id="network-setup">Network setup</h2>
<p>Below will set-up some background configuration to allow tunneling of
packets and configure the firewall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enable internet protocol (IP) forwarding</p>
<p>This will allow packets to move between the WireGuard interface
and the egress interface.</p>
<p>First enable it on the running system:</p>
<pre><code><span># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then make it be enabled after system reboot:</p>
<pre><code><span># echo  'net.inet.ip.forwarding=1' &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Configure pf</p>
<p>Configure OpenBSD's firewall/packet filter,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> to open the port for WireGuard,
allow traffic between WireGuard peers, and forward tunneled traffic
from the client to the internet. To do so, add the following lines
to your <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span># wireguard
</span><span># open wireguard port
</span><span>pass in on egress proto udp from any to any port 51820
</span><span># allow communication between wireguard peers
</span><span>pass on wg0
</span><span># allow clients connected to wg0 to tunnel their outside world traffic
</span><span>pass out on egress inet from (wg0:network) nat-to (egress:0)
</span></code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wireguard-configuration">WireGuard Configuration</h2>
<p>Previous to OpenBSD 6.8, configuration required the wireguard-tools
packages. Now that WireGuard is in base, we can do all
configuration with base utils. This is all nicely documented
in the manual pages ( <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg">wg(4)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(4)</a>) and summarised below:</p>
<h3 id="set-up-wg0">Set-up wg0</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate a end point private key</p>
<p>WireGuard uses a Curve25519 key that is 32 bytes in length and
base64 encoded. A Curve25519 key needs 5 particular bits to be
configured in a certain way to valid, but wg(4) can correct
this from any randomly generated 32 bytes. Therefore, we just
need a 32 bytes random base 64 encoded string and can use
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl">openssl(1)</a> for that:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ openssl rand -base64 32 &gt; ep_private.key
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will save the private key to <code>ep_private.key</code>. Keep a hold of
this for now. We can delete it after the set-up is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring up wg0 interface</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 create wgkey "$(cat ep_private.key)" wgport 51820
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Save end point public key</p>
<p>Bringing up the wg0 interface generates a public key from the
private key. You will need to give this public key to the client (your
laptop, smart phone etc), so save it for now:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 | grep wgpubkey | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; ep_public.key
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Assign wg0 an IP address</p>
<p>This IP address will be the IP address your endpoint will have on
the VPN. The OpenBSD endpoint will be reachable at 10.0.0.1
by clients (smartphone, laptop, etc) which will also be on the
10.0.0.0/24 subnet. I recommend picking an ip address range randomly
to prevent any collision between a network you may join and your
WireGuard network (eg 10.12.24.0/24). To keep things simple for this
tutorial I'll just use 10.0.0.0/24 subnet and give the end point the
first IP address:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 10.0.0.1/24
</span></code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>wg0 is now set up and functional.</p>
<h3 id="generate-public-private-key-pair-for-client">Generate public/private key pair for client</h3>
<p>Below is a bit of a hack so we can use base utilities only. It brings
up a temporary wg interface with a generated private key just so we can
extract the generated public key.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate a client private key</p>
<pre><code><span>$ openssl rand -base64 32 &gt; client1_private.key
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will save the private key to <code>client1_private.key</code>. Keep a hold of
this for now. We can delete it after the set-up is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring up wg1 interface</p>
<p>Note, I'm picking a different port (this can be whatever you want)
since wg0 is already up on 51820.</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg1 create wgkey "$(cat client1_private.key)" wgport 51822
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Save client public key</p>
<p>You will need to use this public key on the OpenBSD endpoint in
order for the client to connect. </p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg1 | grep wgpubkey | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; client1_public.key
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Remove the temporary wg1 interface</p>
<p>This will remove the temporary interface we created to extract keys:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg1 destroy
</span></code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="finalize-setting-up-openbsd-endpoint">Finalize setting up OpenBSD Endpoint</h3>
<p>Now that we have the client's public key, we can establish a WireGuard
peer on the endpoint to allow the client to connect:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 wgpeer "$(cat client1_public.key)" wgaip 10.0.0.2/32
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will limit the IP address of the peer to 10.0.0.2. Changed the IP
address to the IP address you would like on the subnet you picked.</p>
<h3 id="enable-configuration-to-persist-on-reboot">Enable configuration to persist on reboot</h3>
<p>With the above instructions, your endpoint works. However, it will not
work once you reboot the operating system. Save this configuration with
the below text in <code>/etc/hostname.wg0</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>wgkey REPLACE_WITH_EP_PRIVATE_KEY wgport 51820
inet 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
wgpeer REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PUBLIC_KEY \
        wgaip 10.0.0.2/32
</span></code></pre>
<p>Making sure to replace <code>REPLACE_WITH_EP_PRIVATE_KEY</code> with the text stored
in <code>ep_private.key</code> and <code>REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PUBLIC_KEY</code> with the text
stored in <code>client1_public.key</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure the permissions for <code>/etc/hostname.wg0</code> are correct so users
outside of root and those in the group wheel cannot read the keys:</p>
<pre><code><span># chmod 640 /etc/hostname.wg0
# chown root:wheel /etc/hostname.wg0
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, after a reboot OpenBSD will bring up the WireGuard endpoint for you
automatically.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phone-configuration">Smart phone configuration</h2>
<p>With the endpoint set-up, now you just need to configure your smart
phone to use the tunnel. The authors of WireGuard provide apps for both
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>
and
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209">iOS</a>. These
applications make configuration easy. You just need to take a photo of a
QR code made from a client.conf that you can write on your computer. The
client.conf should have the following contents:</p>
<pre><code><span>[Interface]
PrivateKey = REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PRIVATE_KEY
Address = 10.0.0.2/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = REPLACE_WITH_EP_PUBLIC_KEY
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = OPENBSD_EP_IP_ADDRESS:51820
</span></code></pre>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PRIVATE_KEY</code> with the
contents from <code>client1_private.key</code>, <code>REPLACE_WITH_EP_PUBLIC_KEY</code> with
the contents from <code>ep_public.key</code>, and <code>OPENBSD_EP_IP_ADDRESS</code> with the
IPv4 address of your OpenBSD end point.</p>
<p>Next, generate a qr code with this information using the <code>libqrencode</code>
package. If you do not want to install a package outside of base, you
can enter the above info by hand into your phone instead. Then do the
following to create the code:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ qrencode -t ansiutf8 &lt; client.conf
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you have issues taking a photo from the QR code generated in your
terminal, you can also save it as an image and take a photo of the
image.</p>
<p>Open your WireGuard application and take a photo of the QR code,
and the app is now configured! Toggle the switch in the app
to turn it on. To verify it is working, go to a website like
<a href="http://icanhazip.com/">icanhazip.com</a> to see your IP address. It should
change when the WireGuard tunnel is up to the same address as your
OpenBSD end point.</p>
<p>Once everything works, if you want, you can delete the key files and client.conf:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ rm {client1,ep}_{public,private}.key
$ rm client.conf
</span></code></pre>
<p>Enjoy securely tunneling your traffic with WireGuard!</p>

October 22, 2020 | https://www.hyperinbox.app/blog/how-to-write-effective-email | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.hyperinbox.app/blog/how-to-write-effective-email">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There isn't a more dramatic love/hate relationship in professional communication than we have with emails. There are at least a dozen emails we all regret hitting "send" without looking over one more time. The static nature of its inability to edit calls for precision in writing and clarity to what you're trying to achieve.</p><p>As <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/11-awkward-things-about-email.html">Tim Urban</a> said before, not having an email today would be the equivalent of not having a phone number. Everything goes through email. But more importantly, Email is how we communicate for work. It is the lowest common denominator for every working professional in the world to communicate.</p><p>This is why we all need to be writing effective emails. Writing better emails allows us to do more things with less time (fewer threads) and keep our minds focused on important things.</p><p>Throughout my career with IBM and Walmart, and now with Hyperinbox as a founder, I've read tens of thousands of emails that could have been written better. I've written emails that I wish I could take back and write them again.</p><p>From my learnings on email, I have two pieces of advice on writing better emails. Aside from fundamental grammar and formatting, these two learning points have served me well thus far in handling email communication.</p><p>I've also read others' take on writing better emails. There are literally guides, books, lectures, and seminars on how to write a good email. You can look at them, but I think at the core of any communication, the most important factor to consider is putting yourself in the shoes of your audience. Hence, the two ways of writing an effective email:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Brevity and cutting through the chase</li><li>Communicating your agenda/goal in the email</li></ol><h3><strong>Brevity is a sign of respect. Get to the point.</strong></h3><p>Many people tend to write lengthy introductions before they talk about why they're sending the email in the first place. They usually start with a greeting, then assures they hope you're doing well, talk about the weather, then go through a whole bunch of B.S. before they finally write the ask.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6bafe1ce94407594a1c388/5f8f68ef2ff8472fafcd6721_Screen%20Shot%202020-10-19%20at%2014.05.18.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>COVID-19 version.</figcaption></figure><p>As a busy founder, and this goes for any professional, email has become too much of a distraction, and all we want at the end of the day is a clear, empty inbox! And these fluffy opening statements don't help.</p><p>Keeping your messages short, concise, and straight to the point is a show of respect. You’re mindful of the reader's time. You are putting yourself in the shoes of your reader. Your reader doesn't want to read all of that opening statement. She just wants to get to the point.</p><p>If you respect other's time, send a concise email. Keep it short. You don't need "hope you're doing okay" or "how are you doing?" added to your email every time. I've also seen "I know you're a busy guy" or "since we know you're busy with everything." These are formalities that satisfy no one.</p><p>We include those as a courtesy and because we don't want to sound rude. But I would rather read a cold but short and concise email than go through a 300-word heart-warming essay.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><p><code>
To: chris@pixelic.io<br>
From: james@company.com<br>
Subject: (subject untitled)<p>

Dear Chris,</p><p>

Hi! I know you're busy, so I'll make this quick.</p><p>

How are things? I’m currently working in Chicago and it’s been great! Summer is coming, so can’t complain too much about the chill weather right now.</p><p>

Anyways, I’ve been meaning to ask you for an introduction to John Doe from Company X I found him on LinkedIn, and it seems you are well connected to him! I’m working on a new project and I think John could help me out on X. </p><p>

Let me know if I could be of help with anything!<br>
All the best,</p><p>

James</p><p>

VP of Marketing | Company X<br>
Email: james@company.com<br>
Phone: +1 (650) 123-1234<br>
LinkedIn | Facebook | Twitter</p></code></p><p>What if you can trim all of this down to this:</p><p><code>
To: chris@pixelic.io<br>
From: james@company.com<br>
Subject: Intro request<p>
  
Chris, can you introduce me to John Doe at Company X? I found him on LinkedIn and seems he can help me out on a project I'm working on.</p></code></p><p>Here's how you can trim your email:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Write shorter sentences.</li><li>Stay away from fluffy, ambiguous words</li><li>Talk direct.</li><li>But don't be an asshole - you do want to write long whenever necessary. Know when to write long.</li></ol><h3><strong>Communicate your agenda clearly.</strong></h3><p>Naval Ravikant, co-founder of AngelList, has a great template for rejecting meeting requests. Let's admire his template for a few seconds:</p><p><code>
Hey {{ first_name }},<p>

Just want to be upfront.</p><p>

I don’t do non-transactional meetings. I don’t do meetings without a strict agenda. <br>
I don’t do meetings unless we absolutely have to.</p><p>

Naval</p></code></p><p>Although I admit my heart would start pounding if I ever receive an email like this from him, this is how strict people should be about protecting their time and focus as they are finite resources that can be only used a set amount each day.</p><p>And the fact that I'm thinking my heart will pound if I ever get Naval's email tells me that I shouldn't be asking for things without setting a clear agenda for the requests that I make through email.</p><p>To be effective and get the most out of your emails, always clarify what you're looking for. Be clear about your motives. Outline what's in it for the reader as well.</p><p>Another part of communicating your agenda clearly is to write the "so what" before anything. Here's an example, though not an email:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6bafe1ce94407594a1c388/5f8f69c254117f7899006f2d_P4-xnIpw.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This is Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook post a few months ago, calling that health workers need more protective gear. See how he started his "so what" first and then laid out the details? This is what effective communication looks like.</p><p>In your email, do the same: write the "so what" first, and then lay out the details that support your point.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>--</p><p><em>If you are remote, and want a universal inbox that integrates with all of your daily apps (Figma, Slack, Github, Jira, Asana, etc.), </em><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/hyperinbox"><em>join the Hyperinbox waitlist</em></a><em>.

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PILOT">Pilot</a> was created by John A. Starkweather in the early 1960s as a programming language for Computer Assisted Instruction.  It has often been compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> because of its use with children.  However, it is a much simpler language than Logo and really specializes in providing an easy way to create question and answer systems.</p>
<h2>Language Description</h2>
<p>Pilot source code consists of lines of the following format:</p>
<p>[label][command][conditional expression]:[operands]</p>
<p><em>Labels</em> are prefixed with <code>*</code> and are used by <code>J:</code> to Jump to and by <code>U:</code> to call a User subroutine.</p>
<p>Common <em>Commands</em> are listed in a table below.</p>
<p>The <em>conditional expression</em> is generally <code>Y</code> or <code>N</code> to indicate whether to execute the command based on the last <code>M:</code> Match command.  Some implementations of Pilot also support more complicated expressions.</p>
<p>The <em>operands</em> for a command are delimited by commas.</p>
<div><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Command</th><th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td>A:&lt;Variable&gt;</td><td>Ask for keyboard input and put result in <em>Variable</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>C:&lt;Expression&gt;</td><td>Compute <em>Expression</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>E:</td><td>End user subroutine / program</td></tr>
  <tr><td>J:&lt;Label&gt;</td><td>Jump to <em>Label</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>M:&lt;List&gt;</td><td>Match last keyboard input against any value in <em>List</em> (Set Y/N logic flag)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>R:&lt;Comment&gt;</td><td>Remark / Comment</td></tr>
  <tr><td>T:&lt;String&gt;</td><td>Type <em>String</em> to display</td></tr>
  <tr><td>U:&lt;Label&gt;</td><td>Jump to a User subroutine at <em>Label</em></td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p><em>Variables</em> are prefixed with a <code>$</code> if a string and for those implementations that support numbers they are generally prefixed with a <code>#</code>.</p>
<h2>Example: Looping Hello, World!</h2>
<p>This example prints 'Hello, World!' ten times with the number prefixing the string.</p>
<pre><code>         C: I=1
*LOOP    T: #I Hello, World!
         C: I=I+1
         C: J=11-I
      J(J): *LOOP
         E:
</code></pre>
<p>The line to print the message, <code>*LOOP    T: #I Hello, World!</code>, uses <code>#I</code> to reference the variable <code>I</code>.  The loop is controlled by the line <code>J(J): *LOOP</code>, which uses a conditional expression, <code>(J)</code>, to indicate that the jump should be performed if 'J &gt; 0'.</p>
<h2>Example: String Matching and Subroutines</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates string matching and subroutines as it repeatedly asks a user to type <code>STRAWBERRIES</code>, <code>QUIT</code> or <code>EXIT</code>.  If the user types <code>STRAWBERRIES</code> it will tell the user how much it likes them with cream  and if the user types either <code>QUIT</code> or <code>EXIT</code> it will exit the program.</p>
<pre><code>*LOOP     T: TYPE STRAWBERRIES OR ELSE (OR QUIT OR EXIT)
          A: $FRUIT
          M: QUIT,EXIT
         JY: *QUIT
          M: STRAWBERRIES
         UY: *ILIKE
          J: *LOOP
*ILIKE    T: I SURE LIKE $FRUIT AND CREAM
*QUIT     E:
</code></pre>
<p>The line <code>A: $FRUIT</code> accepts a string into the variable <code>FRUIT</code>, which is then tested to see if it matches either <code>QUIT</code> or <code>EXIT</code> using <code>M: QUIT,EXIT</code>.  The <code>M:</code> command sets the logic flag which is then tested with <code>JY: *QUIT</code> and if it is true (Yes) then the program jumps to the label <code>*QUIT</code>.  If not then the accept string is tested against <code>STRAWBERRIES</code> and if it matches then the subroutine <code>*ILIKE</code> is called with, <code>UY: *ILIKE</code>.  The <code>*ILIKE</code> subroutine refers to the accepted input string through the variable <code>$FRUIT</code> in, <code>T: I SURE LIKE $FRUIT AND CREAM</code>.  Finally <code>E:</code> is used to exit the subroutine and doubles as the program quit indicator at <code>*QUIT</code>.  Unfortunately, for some reason <code>E:</code> doesn't seem to exit '8080 PILOT' properly.</p>
<h2>8080 PILOT</h2>
<p>8080 PILOT was written by John A. Starkweather, the original author of Pilot, under contract to the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine.  This was ported to CP/M by John I. Frederick in 1977 and v1.2 is available on the Walnut Creek CD in <a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/simtel/cpmug/cpmug012.ark" title="CPMUG012.ARK">CPMUG012.ARK</a>.  Although the version number of the executing program states v1.1.  Interestingly, although this version was released in 1977, John Starkweather says in the March 1982 edition of InfoWorld that <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fz4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">he is <em>going</em> to release a CP/M version</a>.  There is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_02_201803/page/n173/mode/2up">Guide to 8080 Pilot, Version 1.1</a> in the April 1977 issue of Dr. Dobbs Journal.</p>
<p>The examples above are written for <em>8080 PILOT</em>.</p>
<h2>Z-80 PILOT</h2>
<p>Also in the file <a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/simtel/cpmug/cpmug012.ark" title="CPMUG012.ARK">CPMUG012.ARK</a> is a much smaller version of Pilot written for the Z-80.  The source code is only 7k and the .COM file is only 1k, compared to 8080 PILOT whose source code is 67k and .COM file is 5k.  However, this smaller size comes at a cost.  This version doesn't support subroutines or numeric variables.  It also refers to variables in a <code>T:</code> command using a <code>\</code>, e.g. <code>\fruit</code> and <code>A:</code> doesn't accept a variable name, instead it uses the label of the line on which the <code>A:</code> is being executed to indicate the variable name.  Despite these differences for many uses it wouldn't matter much if you just want to present information and question a user.</p>
<h2>PILOT/80</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/cpm/languags/pilot80/pilot80.lbr" title="pilot80.lbr">PILOT/80</a> was written in MBASIC by Kurt Albrecht and the version on the Walnut Creek CD is dated 1983.  It contains its own text-editor, although you can use any editor to create the Pilot source programs by saving them with a '.PIL' extension.  Its use of MBASIC does make it slower but that may not be much of a problem because it doesn't support maths through the <code>C:</code> command.  The documentation is good and I like the inclusion of the <code>I:</code> command to accept single key input as well as the <code>S:</code> command to handle screen functions such as <code>CLEAR</code> to clear the screen.</p>
<h2>Pilot/P</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/simtel/sigm/vols200/vol237/pilot-p.lbr" title="pilot-p.lbr">Pilot/P</a> takes Pilot source code and transpiles it to Pascal/Z source code.  It was written by David Mundie and Raymond E. Penley and the Walnut Creek CD contains v2.5 from 1984.  This implementation departs quite a lot from other Pilot implementations by having a more complex subroutine definition using <code>%:</code> and allowing Pascal statements to be integrated into the Pilot source code.  It also has additional commands such as <code>X:</code> to process an expression which then sets the logic flag.  One last significant change is that variables are referred to by the <code>T:</code> command by surrounding them with the <code>@</code> symbol, e.g. <code>@$varName@</code>.</p>
<p>Pilot/P contains great documentation, has lots of examples and uses 'SUPERSUB' (renamed as 'DO.COM') to automate the process of transpiling to Pascal/Z source code, compiling and linking.</p>
<h2>Video Demonstrating Pilot on CP/M</h2>
<p>Pilot can be seen being used in the following video.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>As you can see, this is a well-known monument in Italy, more specifically in Pisa, hence it’s name: <strong>Tower of Pisa.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pisa Tower picture" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower.png"></p>
<p>This tower has a very interesting history, it was built around the 12th century, but due to the soft ground it was built on, it started tilting. The structure was only stabilized in 2001 after 8 years of remedial work.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the corrections made during these 8 years made the tilting even worse!
Let those who never made a refactoring that made the problem worse throw the first stone. I can’t really blame anyone haha.</p>
<h2>John, the <em>purrgrammer</em></h2>
<p><img alt="John working in a computer" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-the-purrgrammer.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This is John.</li>
<li>John is a Senior Developer always with a lot on his plate.</li>
<li>John is also an amazing programmer with a lot of years of experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, a new project arrived at John’s desk, and it needed:</p>
<p><img alt="John playing with a ball" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-features.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment System</li>
<li>Social Network Authentication</li>
<li>Delivery services integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since John is an excellent professional that always delivers his activities, he tackled the new project head-on and delivered it in time.</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy because he delivered the project in time" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-delivered.png"></p>
<p>After John’s delivery, the rest of his team went on to review his code, and they discovered a few problems, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="Cat's reviewing John's code" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-team-review.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs and inconsistency on payments</li>
<li>Sometimes the deliveries weren’t processed</li>
<li>Authentication was too simple when checking the social networks used</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his project had some bugs" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-bugs.png"></p>
<p>John knew his code had a few bugs. But nearing the deadline, another project appeared and it took a lot of John’s time, so he couldn’t go back and fix the problems.</p>
<p>John and his team had to deliver the project riddled with bugs and problems.</p>
<p>But John kept a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“In the future, I’ll go back and fix those bugs”</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy again, he knows that in the future he'll fix everything" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-refactoring-en.png"></p>
<h3>SPOILER</h3>
<p>C’mon, did you really think that this was going to happen?</p>
<p><img alt="The problems in John’s project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/problems-on-chicos-code-en.png"></p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the problems of John’s code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments couldn’t be processed in different currencies</li>
<li>If the delivery system is offline, the code wouldn’t work</li>
<li>Users with deactivated accounts could still access the system</li>
<li>No automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this, my friends, is what we know as Technical Debt. Why?</p>
<p>Because what happened was that John chose the first solution he could think of in that short deadline, this affected the code’s quality and the team accepted this. In the future, if any logistics of the business, such as accepting different kinds of currency or changing the delivery service, needs to be changed, the <strong>Changing Cost</strong> of the code is going to be enormous. The moment John chose the faster and easiest solution for him was the moment that the Technical Debt was inserted in the code.</p>
<p>What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture from the Tower under construction" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower-construction.png"></p>
<p>It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen with software. The difference is that the bugs and problems are easier to spot in the developing process, because, after a while, new features become impossible to deliver before um fix these bugs.</p>
<h2>Why is Technical Debt always bad?</h2>
<p>We are used to understanding any Technical Debt in software as a very bad thing. And it usually is.</p>
<p>But we can also see it as a strategic and/or economic decision since a project riddled with Technical Debt is still a project that was delivered fast. It can be a very positive thing for the product.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach starts when we start to forget what we have done in the past. Imagine that Technical Debt is a really greasy and tasty junk food. To eat it once or twice may be wonderful, but after the eighth ou ninth meal, it might be time to acknowledge you have a problem.</p>
<p>By accepting that it is a tradeoff, we can move faster to pay the debt in the future. It really something very normal to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Losing Quality vs. Speed up deliveries" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-tradeoff-en.png"></p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you have paid the cost of too much junk food. Just remember that this cost, as well as in software, becomes higher with time.</p>
<p>If you identified some of these situations in your day-to-day tasks, don’t worry, especially if you have some time dedicated to remedying the problem in the future. This is a really common scenario when dealing with software delivery.</p>
<h2>Technical Debt Quadrant</h2>
<p><img alt="Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-quadrant-en.png"></p>
<p>If we look at <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, we can see John in the upper quadrants, between Reckless and Prudent. </p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have enough time to design the best solution, but he also knew that: In the future, he had to come back and improve his code.</p>
<p>Ok, accepting this as something ordinary, we can try to understand who is really responsible for the software’s debt.</p>
<h2>Who’s responsible for the debt?</h2>
<p>If we focus on the name (Technical Debt), we’re lead to think that it’s a problem made by technical people, namely: the developers, who are responsible for writing the code that ultimately caused the debt.</p>
<p>The problem is that software is the result of the structure and processes of a whole company.</p>
<p>Also, the whole software industry changed since the term “Technical Debt” was born. In John’s scenario, for example, the problem with the not-so-good solution that he crafted is more connected to a management issue, or even to the product team, than to himself. We know John is a good developer, but he had to ignore a lot of problems in order to deliver within the established deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bottlenecks that are creating debt come from different parts of the company, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management team vs Developers speed</li>
<li>Product team not having a long-term plan</li>
<li>UI/UX team too far from the developers</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can’t forget that, sometimes, we are indeed to blame for our own bad decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his bad decisions also affect the project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/our-responsability-en.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bad decisions counts</li>
<li>Framework smells</li>
<li>Low test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Like when we choose a new and exciting framework, without investing the necessary time to understand if that is the best tool for the job at hand, or even when we stop paying attention to the signs that a framework is being abandoned, or when the developers aren’t testing and refactoring the application as they should… All of this is our fault. </p>
<p>After discovering which problems we have in our code, we need to look for the tools we can use to help us deal with the situation.</p>
<h2>How to deal with the debt?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting everything?</li>
<li>Hire more people just to deal with the debt?</li>
<li>Stop delivering until we can fix some of the debt?</li>
<li>Creating Technical Debt tasks in a separate Technical Debt board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if people had simply stopped building the Tower of Pisa and destroyed everything to rebuild. The chances of the same mistakes happening, or even new mistakes, were really high. And consider the amount of money necessary for demolishing and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>What if the company simply hired more people to fix the debts? In the case of the Tower, we would have people trying to build it higher working alongside people trying to make it straight and steady. This really doesn’t solve the main problem.</p>
<p>In software, hiring a new team to deal with existing problems would mean that the old team would have to take the time to explain the whole context of the software to the new team. And, believe me, this would take a lot more time than you’d think. </p>
<p>And what if we created a new place to store our Technical Debt task? After a while, this place would become completely invisible to the team.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic strip from the process of creating a new tech debt ticket and adding it to a backlog full of forgotten tickets using dead plants as an analogy" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-backlog.png"></p>
<p>If an ordinary developer’s backlog already has its own old and invisible tasks, imagine creating a whole different board with separate tasks. However, these are the solutions most people usually look for.</p>
<p>So, Luan, if these options aren’t the most viable, what can we do?</p>
<p>After what we already know, we must try to find truly viable solutions to deal with the Technical Debt.</p>
<h2>Sustainable solutions</h2>
<h3>1. I.M.P.A.C.T</h3>
<p><img alt="I.M.P.A.C.T cyclic process" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/impact.png"></p>
<p>IMPACT is a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the first step is about finding the debt spots and, in the second step, we need to make sure that these spots are noticeable for the whole team. You can assure that by creating new tasks flagged as Technical Debt, for example. We can also choose the priorities of these tasks based on their relevance. Tools like Jira have mechanisms to increase the priority of certain tasks over time, which is amazing, because, as we have seen before, the cost of a Technical Debt increases over time.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a plan, and really follow that plan, for the marked tasks. This way, we will effectively Act on the debts and, after the fixes and improvements being implemented, we need to Test and assure that no behaviors were damaged, be it new bugs, features, improvements, or anything that could hinder the final experience.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information about this in a book called “Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt”.</p>
<h3>2. Pareto Principle</h3>
<p>If you don’t know how many tasks you should have for each team iteration.</p>
<p><img alt="Pareto principle demonstrated using Pizza slices" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pareto-principle-en.png"></p>
<p>We can use the Pareto Principle to assign 20% of the team’s productivity to Technical Debt tasks, and the 80% that remains is used in ordinary tasks, as new features, bug fixing, and everything else.</p>
<h3>3. Technical Debt Review Reunions</h3>
<p><img alt="Cat's in a Tech Debt review" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-review.png"></p>
<p>If you have big deliveries in your process after a few iterations, it might be a good thing to have post-mortem reunions to discuss everything that’s been introduced to the code that has the potential to increase the Technical Debt.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can identify the debts earlier.</p>
<p>These are three examples of possible solutions, but I’d advise you to be extra critical and choose the one that fits you and your team the best.</p>
<p>Let’s probe the economical side of this problem. Is it lucrative to work with a system that already has a big Technical Debt cost?</p>
<h2>Is it lucrative</h2>
<p>I’m going to use a lecture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger</a> to illustrate my point. In this lecture, Rainsberger explains the cost of the next new feature for your software and how to diminish your error rate when estimating this cost.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart comparison of the two approaches of software coding" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/next-feature-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this chart, he compares two different costs over time in a project.</p>
<p>As we can see, the cost of a software built without …</p></div></div>

 <li>The US and six of its allies issued a joint statement last week calling on <keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="tech" actualkeyword="tech">tech</keyword> companies to weaken <keyword keytype="Technology" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="encryption" actualkeyword="encryption">encryption</keyword> and make it easier for law enforcement to access people's private messages.</li>
 <li>The UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Japan joined US Attorney General William Barr in calling on tech companies to build "back doors" for law enforcement to access encrypted messages.</li>
 <li>Currently, messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, meaning no one — including the companies that own the apps — can see people's messages unless they obtain and unlock the person's device.</li>
 <li>Barr has for years been pressuring companies like Facebook and <keyword keytype="organization" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Apple" keynameseo="apple" actualkeyword="apple">Apple</keyword> to break end-to-end encryption, but the companies have declined.</li>
</ul>
<p data-pos="4">The US and six of its allies are calling on big tech companies to weaken encryption in order to make it easier for law enforcement to break into messaging apps like iMessage or WhatsApp.</p>
<p data-pos="6">Officials from the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and India joined US Attorney General William Barr to issue an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety" rel="nofollow">international statement</a> last week criticizing tech companies that currently offer end-to-end encryption.</p><p>
Barr has been pressuring tech companies to weaken encryption for years, arguing that end-to-end encryption makes it harder for law enforcement to track down criminals. The Department of Justice has called out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/technology/whatsapp-barr-encryption.html" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-apple-crack-locked-iphones-pensacola-shooter-2020-1" rel="nofollow">Apple</a> for providing end-to-end encryption, but both companies have so far refused to weaken their security protocols.</p><p>
Services like WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, and Zoom use end-to-end encryption, which means all messages are automatically encrypted and can only be decrypted by the unique "key" found on the devices of the sender and recipient. That means nobody — including law enforcement or even the companies that own the apps — can access the messages without obtaining a users' device and logging in.
</p><p data-pos="12">The seven governments want tech companies to find a way to build "back doors" into messaging apps that would let police easily access the messages of suspects in criminal investigations. They also argue that encryption makes it impossible for tech companies to enforce their own terms of service and prevent illegal activity on their apps.</p><p>
"Law enforcement has a responsibility to protect citizens by investigating and prosecuting crime and safeguarding the vulnerable," the countries wrote in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety" rel="nofollow">statement</a>. "End-to-end encryption that precludes lawful access to the content of communications in any circumstances directly impacts these responsibilities, creating severe risks to public safety."</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr>
<p data-pos="16">Last year, all of the same countries except Japan and India issued a similar statement calling on tech companies to create backdoors. Tech companies have consistently objected, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-apple-crack-locked-iphones-pensacola-shooter-2020-1" rel="nofollow">arguing</a> that there's no way to build such backdoors without eliminating end-to-end encryption altogether.</p><p>
Security experts have echoed that sentiment. Chris Howell, CTO of encrypted messaging app Wickr, said the governments' calls would effectively imperil people's </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="privacy" keynameseo="Privacy" actualkeyword="Privacy">privacy</keyword><p> and make apps more vulnerable to cybercriminals in an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-apple-crack-locked-iphones-pensacola-shooter-2020-1" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with Business Insider earlier this year.
"There is no security mechanism that can discriminate between a hacker trying to crack it and a law enforcement officer trying to do the same thing," Howell said. "Either we secure it or we don't, it's that simple."</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr If every person on the planet grows 10 tomato plants a year, we could offset Germany’s annual CO2 emissions.</strong></p>

<p>I think everyone should grow some plants. If you have a (backyard) garden, a balcony, or just a windowsill, you should grow something. There are a lot of direct and indirect benefits from doing that. I will focus on some of these.</p>

<h2 id="to-help-regenerate-the-environment">To help regenerate the environment</h2>

<p>I think this the most obvious and should be enough to start growing whatever you like immediately. One tomato plant fixates 1.5kg of CO2 per year on average[1]. If every person on the planet grows 10 plants a year (~ 7.594.000.000 people), we could sequester ~1.1 billion tons of CO2. This is more than the annual CO2 emissions of Germany.[2] Sure this is a simple calculation, and it is not accounting for CO2 spend on the work and materials you need to grow that plant, but you get the idea of how powerful your backyard plot can be. Also don’t forget the billions of tomatoes this will produce and they would not need to be produced and delivered through highly emission inefficient food systems. If you really care about this reason, then there are plants for even better sequestration of CO2 than a tomato[3].</p>

<h2 id="to-lower-your-expenses">To lower your expenses</h2>

<p>Don’t worry. I am not talking about money here. Sure, many people have enough space to grow enough food to sell it at some scale, and you can try it with your 10 tomato plants from above, but you can lower your expenses by growing your own plants in many different ways. One obvious way is to consume your own produce. Suppose you use it for food, medicine, or raw materials like wood and fiber. If you can grow some things by yourself, you need to buy less.
Another way is to use it to swap your produce with friends, family, and neighbors with other products you are not producing by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="to-reconnect-to-nature">To (re)connect to nature</h2>

<p>Growing a plant is a magical experience. You will see the magic of life and how much patience you need for this to happen. Seeing the first little green spikes pushing out of the soil will make you happier than the last binge-watching session you had. And imagine all that excitement and waiting for the first ripe tomato for you to harvest. It will feel like being five again waiting for Christmas. And then you eat the fruit that you grew by yourself, and you taste pure success. If you need a visual to that feeling, watch the scene of Castaway with Tom Hanks when he managed to make fire. Just do it without the fire, please, or you will kill your happily grown CO2 offset.</p>

<p>Happy growing 🌱✌️,</p>

<p>Ben</p>

                    <p>There seems to be a fundamental misconception of why people are enjoying Quibi's demise. Startup vets seem to believe it's making fun of people who took a big swing and failed.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The glee about Quibi's failure seems to me misguided. Startups are hard. There's no honor in applauding when they fail. To me it's impressive that people so established would undertake a project so risky. Especially considering the probable reaction if they failed.</p>— Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1319301182796517379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>But it's far from that. It's not just that Quibi was a terrible idea, a lot of products begin as terrible sounding ideas and then take off. There were a ton of jokes about Snapchat's disappearing messages when it first launched. </p><p>The joy of Quibi's demise has more to do with seeing numerous bad decisions have an unsurprisingly poor outcome.</p><h2 id="authenticity">Authenticity</h2><p>Consumers want authenticity. Not just from art but from the products they use and the creators behind them. From its inception, Quibi failed the authenticity smell check. It had a ton of funding. Executives with decades of experience. And a splashy launch that few can afford. Shows from big-name creators and actors didn't help either. </p><p>It all felt like some huge media company trying to shove its product down our throat. A lot like a notable failure they seemingly never heard about, go90.</p><p>Rather than take the approach of a startup to validate their idea they went full steam ahead assuming they knew exactly what people wanted.</p><h2 id="why-even-exist">Why Even Exist?</h2><p>If you're going to create a new product you better be able to convince people there's a reason it should exist. Most products solve some problem. Maybe a problem people weren't fully aware of before. Quibi never seemed clear on what it was solving.</p><p>Looking for shortform content? There's Youtube &amp; TikTok. Content on the go? Youtube, TikTok, Instagram. Content while at home? Netflix, Disney+, etc. Why would anyone pay for Quibi with all these free alternatives available?</p><h2 id="poor-tech">Poor Tech</h2><p>This is probably the most inexcusable aspect of it all. You raise all that money, hire a bunch of people, and still don't at least have a great app. Not being able to share clips. No TV support. Not even screenshot support. How did anyone miss those? Creating good content is difficult and failing at it can be excused. Netflix took years to reliably create good content. But failing at the basic aspects of your product is embarrassing.</p><h2 id="schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</h2><p>All these decisions (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix">and a bunch more</a>) put together painted Quibi as a company run by arrogant execs who thought their experience meant they knew better than their audience. And that advertising alone would be enough to create a successful product. </p><p>Seeing so much money wasted made laughing at their downfall easy. The internet values authenticity and will always ridicule hubris. Quibi's money couldn't make it go viral but their execs terrible decisions have done it with ease.</p>

                        <p>This is part-5 of the case study on Boost Debt Collections and Recoveries using Machine Learning (MLBR). A machine learning predictive model to enhance the current recovery system by creating focus groups for business to boost debt collection.</p><blockquote><em><em><em><em><u>Disclaimer:</u> This case study is solely an educational exercise and information contained in this case study is to be used only as a case study example for teaching purposes. This hypothetical case study is provided for illustrative purposes only and do not represent an actual client or an actual client’s experience.

We looked at the entities/players involved in the traditional debt recovery process. We also defined the objective of our use case and highlights of the proposed machine learning solution.</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p2/">Part-2</a>, we looked at the data elements and high level design. We also discussed the data collection process and design of the data pipeline. We also discussed the complex data variables created as result of feature engineering. We also discussed the importance of expert opinion in this complex case study. The value of expert opinion and how collection score turned out to be a significant key attribute in Modeling phase.</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p3/">Part-3</a>, we discussed the modeling phase. We also explained the learning phase and the various data sets. How Training data set, Test data set and cross validation data set are prepared.</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p4/">Part-</a>4, we reviewed the training results of the various models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). </p><p>In this part, we will look at the Cross Validation Result and Implementation.</p><h3 id="4-7-testing-and-cross-validation">4.7. &nbsp; Testing and Cross Validation</h3><p>The basic idea of Cross Validation is to test the model using historical snapshot. A particular point in history is taken as a reference. The data prior to that point is fed to the model. Model predict the recovery for that historical point. These predictions are then compared against real data. Illustrated below is the cross validation approach adopted.</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cross Validation Approach</figcaption></figure><p>Two tests were performed using two different unseen snapshots. One for Mar 2018 and another for Mar 2019.</p><h3 id="1-cross-validation-1-cv1-">1) &nbsp;Cross Validation-1 (CV1)</h3><p>It is the first test performed and snapshot-1 is used. The idea of this test was to run models on a historical snapshot (snapshot-1) and then compare the results with a 7 months later snapshot as illustrated in figure 9. The objective of this cross validation is to validate the model predictions with actual results available in Snaphot 2.</p><h3 id="2-cross-validation-2-cv2-">2) &nbsp;Cross Validation-2 (CV2)</h3><p>This is second test which is exactly similar to first test (CV1). The only difference here is that we executed models on much older snapshot (fig. 9: “testing” dataset from snapshot-0 ). The results are then compared with snapshot-2 (same as in CV1). Note that the time difference between both snapshots here is almost 1.5 years. The larger time window between both snapshots will give us more confidence on the accuracy of the model.</p><h3 id="4-7-1-results-and-cross-validation">4.7.1. &nbsp;Results and Cross Validation</h3><p>Results are reviewed and evaluated for both CV1 and CV2 cross validations.</p><h3 id="a-cross-validation-1-results-cv1-">A) &nbsp;Cross Validation-1 Results (CV1)</h3><p>For this round of testing, currently we have fed only the clients with write off amount over $1000, that’s why the last row is empty. We will update this table with those remaining clients as well. The inferences from the below results are,</p><ol><li><strong>73%</strong> of “High probable” worked customers have returned some/full amount.</li><li><strong>23% </strong>of “Medium probable” worked customers have returned some/full amount.</li><li><strong>None</strong> of the Low and Zero probable customers have paid any money so far but they may do in future.</li></ol><p>Based on the above inference, we can say that Recoveries can be improved if</p><ol><li>We work 100% of the clients in “High” and “Medium”.</li><li>We reduce the effort spent on “Low” customers. Probably may focus on clients high balance amount in write off.</li><li>We do not work on “Zero” base. It is better to sell this debt to external debt collectors, as the recovery rate is less than 1%.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cross Validation-1</figcaption></figure><p>We further identified the monetary benefit of working based on this model results. If our agents work on all the cases in “High” and “Medium” probable clients based, our recovery would increase by 11%.</p><h3 id="b-cross-validation-2-results-cv2-">B) &nbsp;Cross Validation-2 Results (CV2)</h3><p>The results of the Mar 2018 prediction are given below. Few inferences as per this results are,</p><ol><li>Out of all customers in “High probability” Category, agents have worked on 60% and were able to collect from 75% with <strong>recovery rate of 63%.</strong></li><li>Out of all “Medium probability” customers, they have worked only on 27%. We should work on these remaining cases.</li><li>Out of all worked customers in “Low” bucket, the return was 6% returns, which may be a wasted effort. This effort should have been spent on High and Medium.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cross Validation-2</figcaption></figure><p>The monetary gain we would have made by working on all of the High and Medium clients. The inferences are,</p><ol><li>The recovery rate from “High” customers is 49%. This considers only the clients we have contacted. The uncontacted clients in the High Category as 60%. Assuming we get the same 49% recovery from these customers, we would be able to recover at least 25% more.</li><li>Same with Medium category as well. By working remaining unworked clients, we would be able to increase our recovery by $13% as shown in green at the last row.</li><li>If the above numbers turns true in real world, then we would realize a high net increase in our recoveries.</li></ol><p>That's all about this case study. Hope this series of post on Boost Debt Collection and Recovery using Machine Learning have been valuable to those who are intrigued.</p><p><em><strong>Tools and Technologies Used:</strong></em></p><ol><li>Oracle Advanced Analytics for machine learning.</li><li>R programming language.</li><li>OBIEE for dashboard and reports development.</li></ol><p>Cheers :)</p>

<p>Say goodbye to another amateur radio band. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has ruled that it will revoke amateur radio privileges on the 3300-3500 MHz (9-cm Microwave band). The FCC will auction the band to wireless telecom companies to support 5G rollouts across the United States. The dates when amateur radio privileges will “sunset” have yet to be approved. Ham radio operators should expect this to occur sometime in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We adopt our proposal from the&nbsp;<em>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</em>&nbsp;to remove the amateur allocation from the 3.3 – 3.5 GHz band,” the FCC said in its&nbsp;<em>Report and Order</em>&nbsp;(<a target="_blank" href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1002214202488/FCC-20-138A1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>R&amp;O</em></strong></a>) and&nbsp;<em>Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&nbsp;</em>in WT Docket No. 19-348, adopted on September 30 and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2020-22528/facilitating-shared-use-in-the-3100-3550-mhz-band" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>published</strong></a>&nbsp;October 9 in&nbsp;<em>The Federal Register</em>,&nbsp;<em>R&amp;O</em>. “[W]e adopt changes to our rules today that provide for the sunset of the secondary amateur allocation in the band, but allow continued use of the band for amateur operations, pending resolution of the issues raised in the&nbsp;<em>Further Notice</em>.”</p><cite>– Federal Communication Commission  </cite></blockquote>



<p>Many ham radio operators likely haven’t used the 9-centimeter band, but that doesn’t mean it’s dead. Operators are doing moonbounce operations, and other microwave experimenters are active on the band. The most exciting use could be the <a href="https://www.arednmesh.org/">Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network (AREDN)</a> project. The 9-centimeter band provides 24 channels on 3.5 GHz that are not currently shared with Part 15 users.&nbsp;AREDN mesh networks have proven to be useful in emergency situations. </p>







<p>We should all be asking the real question. Why is this happening? Look no further than the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/19">MOBILE NOW Act</a>. The MOBILE NOW Act was introduced by Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) in 2017 and signed by President Donald Trump in 2018. The legislation directs the FCC to make additional spectrum available to auction for mobile and fixed wireless broadband to support 5G development.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Following the telecom money</h2>



<p>It’s not a secret that 5G will require a lot of spectrum. LTE channel bandwidth maxes out at 20 MHz per-channel. 5G channel bandwidth can be as wide as 100 MHz. No, that’s not a typo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wireless carriers have been <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/12/fccs-largest-spectrum-auction-nets-4-47-billion-for-5g-mmwave-bands/">snapping up spectrum in recent years</a> to prepare for 5G rollouts, making billions for the U.S. government in the process. Whoever has the most spectrum will have the most robust 5G network — plain and simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Verizon and AT&amp;Ts of the world would love nothing more than to get their hands on spectrum that’s currently used by the Federal government (or amateur radio). That’s what the MOBILE NOW Act was all about— getting the Federal Government to sell more of the RF spectrum to private telecoms.</p>



<p>Remember Sen. John Thune, the legislator who first introduced the bill? Take a guess who his biggest financial donors are?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/John_Thune_Donors.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="456" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/John_Thune_Donors.jpg 709w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/John_Thune_Donors-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"><figcaption><em>Sen. John Thune financial donors 2015-2020. (OpenSecrets)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>All of the companies highlighted in green have a stake in the development of 5G. Of course, Sen. Thune will introduce legislation as they’ve lobbied him to do. Whoever has the most money has the loudest voice in Congress. </p>



<h2>The threat to ham radio</h2>



<p>Private telecom companies pushing to purchase spectrum is the <em>greatest threat</em> to ham radio. It’s not FT8, DMR/YSF/D-Star or any other digital mode that hams grumble about.  More than ever we need effective representation in Washington D.C. advocating for the value that amateur radio provides to the <s>country </s> world. </p>



<p>However, the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/">American Radio Relay League (ARRL)</a> is actually doing less than ever before, only focusing on the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/466">Ham Radio Parity Act</a> which protects ham radio operators from HOAs. The bill remains stuck in committee.  </p>



<h4>Amateur Radio Relay League Lobbying Efforts</h4>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="646" height="400" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ARRL_Lobbying.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ARRL_Lobbying.jpg 646w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ARRL_Lobbying-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px"></figure></div>

I couldn’t stop taking notes and shuffling my many thoughts that kept rising during these intense moments. </p><p>Here the definite highlights are the exploration of neuroticism and transference. This is why I eventually ended up with a significantly higher opinion of this book, although it is one of the toughest reads I've ever had. The writing here is heavily grounded in theoretical psychoanalysis, which might turn a lot of people off, but if you manage to plow through it all there are lots of gems to be found. </p><p>Here you get to dive into such great minds like Otto Rank, Sigmund Freud, Søren Kierkegaard and many others. If you've ever read the biography or learned about Steve Jobs (the founder of Apple), you might have started disliking him as you got to know his actual personality. Here I got a similarly bad taste of Sigmund Freud, as I didn't study him before. His thinking and obsessive over-sexualization feel ridiculous. What also left a bad taste from the book overall was an unusually heavy focus on the male gender while a female perspective was secondary or often completely sidelined. </p><p>Overall, this was a true revolution for my understanding of psychology, belief systems, religion and some aspects of life and death in general. If you get the book, get ready for an incredible ride. Below you can study some of the highlights that I made myself while reading it. </p><h2 id="content">Content</h2><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Society as a mythical hero system</li><li>Animal versus a conscious man</li><li>Freedom and anxiety</li><li>Transference and its effect on group psychology</li><li>Relationships</li><li>Narcissism</li><li>Neurosis</li><li>Fall of religion and rise of psychology</li><li>Death</li></ul><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The following three strands give an overview of the book. As in the foreword by Sam Keen and Daniel Goleman:</p><p><strong>First strand (the world): </strong>"The world is terrifying. To say the least, Becker’s account of nature has little in common with Walt Disney. Mother Nature is a brutal bitch, red in tooth and claw, who destroys what she creates. We live, he says, in a creation in which the routine activity for organisms is “tearing others apart with teeth of all types—biting, grinding flesh, plant stalks, bones between molars, pushing the pulp greedily down the gullet with delight, incorporating its essence into one’s own organization, and then excreting with foul stench and gasses the residue.”</p><p><strong>Second strand (controlling our anxiety): </strong>"The basic motivation for human behavior is our biological need to control our basic anxiety, to deny the terror of death. Human beings are naturally anxious because we are ultimately helpless and abandoned in a world where we are fated to die. “This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression—and with all this yet to die."</p><p><strong>Third strand (defence mechanisms and repression):</strong> "Since the terror of death is so overwhelming we conspire to keep it unconscious. “The vital lie of character” is the first line of defense that protects us from the painful awareness of our helplessness. Every child borrows power from adults and creates a personality by introjecting the qualities of the godlike being. If I am like my all-powerful father I will not die. So long as we stay obediently within the defense mechanisms of our personality, what Wilhelm Reich called “character armor” we feel safe and are able to pretend that the world is manageable. But the price we pay is high. We repress our bodies to purchase a soul that time cannot destroy; we sacrifice pleasure to buy immortality; we encapsulate ourselves to avoid death. And life escapes us while we huddle within the defended fortress of character."</p><h2 id="society-and-culture-as-a-mythical-hero-system">Society and culture as a mythical hero system</h2><p>"This is what society is and always has been: a symbolic action system, a structure of statuses and roles, customs and rules for behavior, designed to serve as a vehicle for earthly heroism. Each script is somewhat unique, each culture has a different hero system. What the anthropologists call “cultural relativity” is thus really the relativity of hero-systems the world over."</p><p>"It doesn’t matter whether the cultural hero-system is frankly magical, religious, and primitive or secular, scientific, and civilized. It is still a mythical hero-system in which people serve in order to earn a feeling of primary value, of cosmic specialness, of ultimate usefulness to creation, of unshakable meaning. They earn this feeling by carving out a place in nature, by building an edifice that reflects human value: a temple, a cathedral, a totem pole, a sky-scraper, a family that spans three generations. The hope and belief is that the things that man creates in society are of lasting worth and meaning, that they outlive or outshine death and decay, that man and his products count. When Norman O. Brown said that Western society since Newton, no matter how scientific or secular it claims to be, is still as “religious” as any other, this is what he meant: “civilized” society is a hopeful belief and protest that science, money and goods make man count for more than any other animal. In this sense everything that man does is religious and heroic, and yet in danger of being fictitious and fallible."</p><p>"The minority groups in present-day industrial society who shout for freedom and human dignity are really clumsily asking that they be given a sense of primary heroism of which they have been cheated historically. This is why their insistent claims are so troublesome and upsetting: how do we do such an “unreasonable” thing within the ways in which society is now set up? “They are asking for the impossible” is the way we usually put our bafflement."</p><p>"Everything painful and sobering in what psychoanalytic genius and religious genius have discovered about man revolves around the terror of admitting what one is doing to earn his self-esteem. <strong>This is why human heroics is a blind drivenness that burns people up; in passionate people, a screaming for glory as uncritical and reflexive as the howling of a dog.</strong> In the more passive masses of mediocre men it is disguised as they humbly and complainingly follow out the roles that society provides for their heroics and try to earn their promotions within the system: wearing the standard uniforms—but allowing themselves to stick out, but ever so little and so safely, with a little ribbon or a red boutonniere, but not with head and shoulders."</p><p>"If we were to peel away this massive disguise, the blocks of repression over human techniques for earning glory, we would arrive at the potentially most liberating question of all, the main problem of human life: <strong>How empirically true is the cultural hero system that sustains and drives men?</strong>"</p><p>"To lose the security of heroic cultural illusion is to die—that is what “deculturation” of primitives means and what it does. It kills them or reduces them to the animal level of chronic fighting and fornication. Life becomes possible only in a continual alcoholic stupor. Many of the older American Indians were relieved when the Big Chiefs in Ottawa and Washington took control and prevented them from warring and feuding. It was a relief from the constant anxiety of death for their loved ones, if not for themselves. But they also knew, with a heavy heart, that this eclipse of their traditional hero-systems at the same time left them as good as dead."</p><p>"Man will lay down his life for his country, his society, his family. He will choose to throw himself on a grenade to save his comrades; he is capable of the highest generosity and self-sacrifice. <strong>But he has to feel and believe that what he is doing is truly heroic, timeless, and supremely meaningful. The crisis of modern society is precisely that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for action that their culture has set up.</strong> They don’t believe it is empirically true to the problems of their lives and times."</p><p>"When we are young we are often puzzled by the fact that each person we admire seems to have a different version of what life ought to be, what a good man is, how to live, and so on. If we are especially sensitive it seems more than puzzling, it is disheartening. What most people usually do is to follow one person’s ideas and then another’s, depending on who looms largest on one’s horizon at the time. The one with the deepest voice, the strongest appearance, the most authority and success, is usually the one who gets our momentary allegiance; and we try to pattern our ideals after him. But as life goes on we get a perspective on this, and all these different versions of truth become a little pathetic. Each person thinks that he has the formula for triumphing over life’s limitations and knows with authority what it means to be a man, and he usually tries to win a following for his particular patent. Today we know that people try so hard to win converts for their point of view because it is more than merely an outlook on life: it is an immortality formula."</p><h2 id="animal-versus-a-conscious-man">Animal versus a conscious man</h2><p>"But nature has protected the lower animal by endowing them with instincts. An instinct is a programmed perception that calls into play a programmed reaction. It is very simple. Animals are not moved by what they cannot react to. They live in a tiny world, a sliver of reality, one neuro-chemical program that keeps them walking behind their nose and shuts out everything else. <strong>But look at man, the impossible creature! Here nature seems to have thrown caution to the winds along with the programmed instincts.</strong> She created an animal who has no defense against full perception of the external world, an animal completely open to experience. Not only in front of his nose, in his umwelt, but in many other umwelten. He can relate not only to animals in his own species, but in some …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Analogies are always useful to get into the right mindset about how things work. They are even more useful if you’re trying to explain how software engineering works to a non-technical person. </p>



<figure><img src="https://pmtips.net/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/2285/img-construction-health-safety-environmental-audits.jpg" alt="construction"></figure>



<p>People tend to think that building software involves some kind of black magic.  In reality, this process is a lot more methodical and deterministic but is difficult to explain exactly what we do to any outsider. </p>



<p>It’s really hard to get an accurate analogy because it’s not as deterministic as some manufacturing process like crafting chairs but it’s also not as open-ended as writing a book or painting. </p>



<p>We also tend to think our job is mostly about coding and doing some other technical stuff, but the truth is that the software development process is more about the successful interactions between clients, management and software engineers than any other thing.</p>



<p>One useful analogy that could work is civil engineering. Is simple enough that anyone can understand it but is technically consistent to make it accurate.</p>



<h3>Key Similarities</h3>



<ul><li><strong>You cannot estimate the real effort of a project without doing some work first.</strong> You cannot expect to go to an engineering firm and simply ask “How much will it cost to build a bridge like the Golden Gate?”. <br>If you’re an experienced engineer you probably do some rough estimate using the original cost of the bridge, some similar ongoing project, and some other variables but you know that these kinds of estimates are impossible to do. <br>Anyway, folks go lightly asking “How much an app like uber will cost to do?” and most of us want to bang our heads to the wall trying to explain that this is not how it works.</li><li><strong>Most estimates are bullshit and you’ll probably need a lot more time and money to build that.</strong> This is known in software. Many like to pretend estimates are written on stone but we know that they are at best an educated guess. In the construction business, this is also a thing, but they usually don’t pretend that they know what they are estimating. <br>For example, the<a href="https://coffey.com/en/ingenuity-coffey/poor-project-cost-estimates-are-more-than-embarrassing/"> Berlin Airport was estimated to cost </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coffey.com/en/ingenuity-coffey/poor-project-cost-estimates-are-more-than-embarrassing/" target="_blank">€2 billion</a> in 2006 and was expected to be finished in 2012. This airport is still not finished and it’s expected to open on 31 October 2020 and it will cost at least €6.5 billion to complete.</li><li><strong>Changing things in the middle of the project will cost a shit-ton of money and time. </strong>This is another fact most non-technical managers, product owners, and regular folks like to pretend it doesn’t exist. This is why when you’re building your home you don’t suddenly add an extra floor after 70% of the project is already done. But like I was saying, in the software industry we like to pretend is not a big deal and completely normal to add or remove 50% of the original requirements after we were working on the project for 10 months. </li></ul>



<h3>Some Limitations</h3>



<p>Like any abstraction, they are accurate to a certain degree, and there some big differences we’ll need to take into account.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stability of the requirements.</strong> As we saw changing the requirements in the middle of the construction is sometimes prohibitively expensive and some other times borderline impossible. That’s why you wouldn’t turn a house into a sky-crapper halfway down the project. That’s a common practice in software development.</li><li><strong>Stability of prices and scale.</strong> Construction has some major advantages over software development. Most construction materials have stable and known prices and can be bought in bulk even with leasing plans. The scale of the project is also known beforehand, so you can more or less get an accurate estimate of workers and machines you’ll need.</li><li><strong>Documentation. </strong>Even to build a little project like a house requires a hell-lot of documentation and calculations, you’ll need at least 3 different architectural plans. In most software projects documentation is non-existent or completely obsolete because it was never updated after the beginning of the coding phase.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/elex-models-prod/2020-general/write-up/election_model_writeup.pdf" target="_blank">Read the technical writeup</a> | <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/2020-election-night-model" target="_blank">See the code and a sample data</a></p><p>Since November 2019, The Washington Post has constructed several different models for the purpose of estimating the number of outstanding votes in an election.</p><p><a href="https://washpost.engineering/2019/11/01/how-the-washington-post-estimates-turnout-on-election-nights/" target="_blank">Our first model was built to estimate turnout</a> in the Virginia state house and state senate elections in 2019. This model allowed us to stop using the old â€œprecincts reportingâ€� measurement and instead show a â€œpercentage of final vote recorded.â€�</p><p><a href="https://washpost.engineering/2020/02/29/how-the-washington-post-estimates-outstanding-votes-during-primaries/" target="_blank">Our second model was built to estimate turnout and vote share</a> in the Democratic primaries in 2020. This model was built to track the flow in vote share for Democratic candidates between 2016 and 2020. Helpfully, there were only two Democratic candidates in 2016, so this made the process simpler. Additionally, this approach yielded a wonderful descriptive tool which showed the estimated vote flows between candidates, so we could help answer questions like, â€œ<a href="https://washpost.engineering/2020/04/09/how-the-washington-post-generates-vote-flow-diagrams/" target="_blank">Which 2020 candidates are 2016 Clinton voters supporting?</a>â€�</p><p>Today, weâ€™re introducing our third model. In collaboration with our friends at Decision Desk HQ/0ptimus Analytics, weâ€™ve built a model to estimate turnout and vote share for the 2020 Presidential and Senate elections. And while weâ€™ll summarize the high points here, you should read our technical writeup and dive into the code yourself.</p><p>Our new method no longer estimates the covariance between geographic units like our Virginia model did. Instead, we model the quantities we are interested in directly. We do that by estimating the normalized â€œresidualâ€� or error between our pre-night prediction â€” spoiler: the 2016 turnout â€” and what we think turnout will be this year. We use demographic features such as age, gender, ethnicity, income and education as covariates, which means we implicitly leverage the night-of, observed covariances for estimation.</p><p>Estimating the normalized residual instead of turnout directly makes our model less sensitive to population differences in counties. It also makes our model less reactive to the fact that the order of reported counties is not random. In normal elections, rural counties tend to report earlier than urban counties. And because of time zones, states that are further east report results sooner than states that are further west. This year, the order of reported results will be especially bizarre because many states might not report votes totals on election night because of increased vote-by-mail. All those things together mean that we <i>know</i> that the order of counties reporting isnâ€™t a random ordering. But using the normalized residuals as our response variable makes them seem closer to random.</p><p>The predictive core of our model is a quantile regression. The difference between quantile regression and the regression youâ€™re used to seeing, ordinary least squares, is that quantile regression predicts the conditional median instead of the conditional mean. This is yet another technique which makes our prediction less sensitive to outliers. There will invariably be some counties where our covariates arenâ€™t satisfactory for predicting turnout â€” some unmodeled event like a scandal, or that one of the candidates runs a particularly good campaign. Using the median over the mean makes sure that we donâ€™t adjust our parameters too much because of those few outliers, especially early on.</p><p>Another benefit of using quantile regression is that we can estimate other quantiles which are not the median. We can estimate the 0.05th and 0.95th â€” for example â€” quantiles, which gives us a first estimate for our prediction intervals. Critically, this means that we did not make any distributional assumptions to get these prediction intervals. This is a big change from our Virginia model where we assumed turnout to be jointly normal!</p><p>Unfortunately, these prediction intervals arenâ€™t guaranteed to be correct because our model may not be specified properly or because the counties that have delivered early results are particularly unrepresentative. To solve this problem, we use a method called conformal prediction. A modern statistical method that adjusts the prediction intervals generated by quantile regression to make them correct.</p><p>Intrigued? Dive into our model internals <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/elex-models-prod/2020-general/write-up/election_model_writeup.pdf" target="_blank">in this technical writeup</a> or get started with a sample data set by <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/2020-election-night-model" target="_blank">cloning our model code repository</a>.</p><p>As always, reach out to either <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremybowers" target="_blank">Jeremy Bowers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lbronner" target="_blank">Lenny Bronner</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/jjcherian" target="_blank">John Cherian</a> with questions.</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><p>This model was created in cooperation with Decision Desk HQ/0ptimus Analytics.

<![CDATA[Four Features That Justify a New Unix Shell]]>

<p>
  2020-10-22
</p>

<p>On a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/6bphbw/fennel_programming_language_rationale">lobste.rs thread</a> about the rationale for the Fennel language, I
posted this summary of why Oil exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think these features alone would justify a new shell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of "quoting hell"</li>
<li>Getting rid of ad hoc parsing and splitting</li>
<li>Fixing errexit</li>
</ol>
<p>But Oil has a lot more than that, including unifying separate ad hoc
expression languages ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post elaborates on these points.  I've condensed the rationale into four
critical features for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.</p>
<p>I give examples of each feature, link to docs (in progress), and comment on the
future of the project.</p>
 
<a name="the-osh-language"></a>
<h2>The OSH Language</h2>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is designed to run existing shell scripts, and
has done that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>It also fixes warts in the shell language with <strong>opt-in</strong> features.  These are
the four most important ones.</p>
<a name="reliable-error-handling"></a>
<h3>Reliable Error Handling</h3>
<p>I just finished an overhaul of shell's flaky <code>set -e</code> / <code>errexit</code> mechanism.
I'm excited by this, because I started it last year, but put it on the back
burner after being stumped!</p>
<p>I believe I've figured out every problem now, and would like your feedback.
The simple invariant is that <strong>OSH never loses an exit code</strong>, which is not
true of POSIX shell or <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Here's a summary of the enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strict_errexit</code> - A shell option to <strong>detect</strong> cases where you would lose
errors in shell, like <code>if myfunc</code>.  This improves your shell scripts, even if
you run them under another shell!  In other words, OSH can be used as a dev
tool.</li>
<li><code>inherit_errexit</code> - OSH implements this bash 4.4 option, which is a partial
fix for the "command sub errexit" problem.</li>
<li><code>command_sub_errexit</code> - A shell option to check for failure at the end of
every command sub, so you don't lose errors.
<ul>
<li>This fixes the problem shown in the last panel of a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-functions/">recent
comic by Julia Evans</a>:
<em>"bash is weird sometimes"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>process_sub_fail</code> - Like <code>pipefail</code>, but for process substitutions.  It
allows <code>errexit</code> to "see" the failure caused by process subs, like the <code>sort</code>
invocation in <code>cat foo.txt &lt;(sort /oops/error)</code>,
<ul>
<li><code>@_process_sub_status</code>: A variable that's analogous to <code>${PIPESTATUS[@]}</code>.
You may want to inspect the exit status of all processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin turns <code>errexit</code> back on, so <code>if run myfunc</code> is safe.  It
also provides fine-grained control over exit codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are many solutions, because shell has many problems!  But you don't
have to remember all these names.  Add <code>shopt --set oil:basic</code> to the top of
your program to turn all options.  The <code>strict_errexit</code> failures will remind
you to use the <code>run</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>(Aside: I was able to fix all these problems cleanly in the interpreter.  I
spent time a lot of time on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/29.html">Oil's architecture 4 years
ago</a> precisely so I could fix
such subtle problems.  When the code has a good structure, the "right place"
for a fix reveals itself to you.  Oil is still improving!)</p>
<a name="safe-processing-of-user-supplied-data-like-filenames"></a>
<h3>Safe Processing of User-Supplied Data (like filenames)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> is the foundation for <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Structured-Data-in-Oil">Structured Data in
Oil</a>.  It removes
the need to invent ad hoc (and often broken) formats every time you need to
deal with user-supplied data in shell.  In other words, Oil scripts have an
alternative to messy parsing and splitting.</p>
<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, after implementing an encoder earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples.  The <code>write</code> builtin prints its args to stdout,
and it accepts a <code>--qsn</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code># Print filenames ONE PER LINE.  If a name contains a
# newline or other special char, it's QSN-encoded like
# 'multi-line \n name with NUL \0 byte'

write --qsn -- *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read</code> builtin provides the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>cat list.txt | while read --line --qsn {
  # _line is implictly set by 'read'
  rm -- $_line
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented <code>read -0</code> as a synonym for bash's obscure <code>read -r -d ''</code>.
This allows you to consume <code>find -print0</code> output in shell, like <code>xargs -0</code>
does.  This format is distinct from QSN, but it's now easy to convert back and
forth between them.</p>
<p>This is the first cut of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support.  I expect it to evolve based on your
feedback!</p>

</ul>
<a name="eliminate-quoting-hell-the-qefs-problem"></a>
<h3>Eliminate Quoting Hell (the <code>!qefs</code> problem)</h3>
<p>This was done in summer 2019.  I described it in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a> earlier this year, and you can see examples in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Oil allows this:</p>
<pre><code>ls @myflags $filename
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>ls "${myflags[@]}" "$filename"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>@</code> splice operator, and lack of quotes.</p>
<a name="static-parsing-enables-better-error-messages-and-tools"></a>
<h3>Static Parsing Enables Better Error Messages and Tools</h3>
<p>This blog began in 2016 with an explanation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">static
parsing</a>.  I didn't mention it in the comment quoted in
the intro, but it's still a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>I was reminded how important this is when noticing that the authors of both
Perl 5 and the rc shell <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7bpgbl/rc_plan_9_shell#c_mokqrn">made complaints about shell's dynamic
parsing</a>, going back 20-30
years!</p>
<p>This foundation is still paying dividends.  I recently used the static parser
to create detailed error messages for command subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set errexit command_sub_errexit</span>

<span>$</span> <span>d=$(date %x)</span>
date: invalid date ‘%x’
  d=$(date %x)
    ^~
[ interactive ]:13: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>and process subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set process_sub_fail</span>

<span>$</span> <span>cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)</span>
sort: cannot read: oops: No such file or directory
  cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)
                ^~
[ interactive ]:27: fatal: Exiting with status 2 ...
</code></pre>
<p>We point to the location of the failing construct.  No other shell does this!</p>
<p>In addition, Travis Everett has worked on a shell dependency bundler which
relies on static parsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: The new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/syntactic-concepts.html">Syntactic Concepts</a> doc lists static parsing as
one of 5 important concepts.</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-next-for-the-project"></a>
<h2>What's Next For the Project?</h2>
<p>It was indeed useful to explicitly write out rationale for the language.  I've
done that many times with posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=why-a-new-shell#why-a-new-shell">why-a-new-shell</a>, but
explaining it again helps, even after 4 years.  The project is evolving and
getting crisper.</p>
<a name="a-very-important-claim"></a>
<h3>A Very Important Claim</h3>
<p>With the overhaul of <code>errexit</code> and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, I believe we now have
all the bases for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> covered!  These features
will be out with the next release.</p>
<p>The claim is that <strong>these four features alone justify a new Unix shell</strong>.  If
we finish the C++ translation, and end the project here, it would be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>To repeat, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable error handling.  I can't recommend shell to my friends without
these fixes.</li>
<li>Safe processing of user-supplied data, i.e. an alternative to ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</li>
<li>Elimination of "quoting hell".  Let's fix it once and for all, rather than
admonishing every new shell programmer about it for the next 30 years, as
has been done for the past 30!</li>
<li>Static Parsing for better error messages and tools.  It also removes a
security issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disagree, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">let me know</a>!  I would like to hear what other
warts in the <strong>shell language</strong> need to be fixed or otherwise addressed.</p>
<p>(I'm leaving out the interactive shell here, as I believe the first priority is
a better shell for programming and automation.  A "cloud shell", if you will.)</p>
<a name="reviewing-the-biggest-cut-january-2020"></a>
<h3>Reviewing The Biggest Cut (January 2020)</h3>
<p>Back in January, I was already <strong>concerned about the scope</strong> of the project.  I
wrote that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html#the-biggest-cut">the biggest cut</a> to the
project would be that Oil would be based on <strong>strings</strong>, rather than
Python-like data types.</p>
<p>Let me update that statement based on these crisp definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> is a compatible shell based on <strong>strings</strong>
(and arrays of strings).  Assignments look like <code>local x=mystr</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> has Python-like <strong>types and expressions</strong>.
Assignments look like <code>var x = 42 + a[i] + f(x, y)</code>.  It has a
garbage-collected heap of recursive data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm saying now is that the priority going forward is to
<strong>polish the OSH language</strong>, and put off the Oil language until the hazy
future.</p>
<p>That means finishing the translation to C++, hooking up the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/08/risks.html#garbage-collection">garbage
collector</a>, and writing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc">documentation</a>.  It may mean preparing the code to
be embedded in another application, like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=fish#fish">fish</a> shell.  (I've
<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Fish-Oil-Brainstorming">discussed this</a>
with the maintainer, and there's some interest.  But it's a lot of work, which
shouldn't be taken for granted, and there are unsolved problems.)</p>
<p>Achieving this OSH language milestone feels very doable, since everything
already works in Python, and something like <strong>915</strong> out of <strong>1685</strong> spec tests
pass in C++ (yielding a 30x - 50x speedup).</p>

<a name="oil-language-updates"></a>
<h3>Oil Language Updates</h3>
<p>But I'm not giving up on the Oil language!  I just need help. It exists in
prototype form, and your feedback will motivate me to work on it.</p>
<p>Here are some blog posts I want to write, to get the word out:</p>
<p><em>Four Features of the Oil Language</em>.  This post narrowed down OSH to four major
features, and Oil also has four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python-like expressions, along with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/eggex.html">eggexes</a></li>
<li>Ruby-like blocks, which enable DSLs and declarative configuration</li>
<li>procs (shell functions with signatures, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts">which compose in unique
ways</a>)</li>
<li>Serialization formats like JSON and QTSV
(<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">proposal</a>).  The
latter is a format for <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html">typed tables</a>, built on top
of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have working prototypes for every feature except QTSV.  You can <a href="http://oilshell.org/release/latest/">try them
now</a>!</p>
<p><em>Big Changes to the Oil Language</em>.  A list of recent changes I've made, which
should give potential contributors a feel for the language.</p>
<p><em>What Distinguishes Python, JS, and Ruby from Perl and PHP</em>.   The former
languages have a clean data model / memory model: a garbage collected heap with
reference semantics.</p>
<p>The latter languages have warts in their model.  Oil adds the clean model to
shell.</p>
<p><em>Comments on Comics</em>.  I can use these <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">recent
comics</a> as a way to explain the
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.  (See other posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=comic#comic">comic</a>.)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I described 4 essential features of an improved shell language.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">Let me

though I still need to update it for 2021.</p>
<p>I then proposed a focus on making the OSH language "production ready".  I'm
still going to work on the Oil language, but I need help finishing it.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/" target="_blank">Bakeware</a> is a new fantastic tool, built (by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/fhunleth" target="_blank">Frank Hunleth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jjcarstens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon Carstens</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ConnorRigby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Connor Rigby</a>) over a weekend for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spawnfest.github.io/" target="_blank">SpawnFest 2020</a>, which compiles an Elixir, a Scenic or a Phoenix application into single executable binary (yes, like go-lang!). It can be extremely useful to distribute our apps, especially when they are command-line tools or Scenic applications.</p>



<p>For most of the Phoenix app deployments, this tool maybe is not crucial, but I think that sometime it can be really useful to have a Phoenix/Phoenix LiveView app (along with all the needed assets!) in a single, and easily sharable, binary.</p>



<p>Let’s see how to make it work with a Phoenix LiveView application. What we are going to see applies to CLIs and Scenic apps as well.</p>



<h2>Bakeware library and Counter LiveView example</h2>



<p>At the moment there isn’t an official library on <a href="http://hex.pm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hex.pm</a>, so let’s start by downloading the Bakeware’s code from its <a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repo, spawnfest/bakeware</a>.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware.git
Cloning into 'bakeware'...
...
$ ls bakeware/bakeware
Makefile  README.md assets    lib       mix.exs   mix.lock  src       test
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>In the <em><a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/tree/main/examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bakeware/examples</a></em> folder, you can also find other useful examples. The library code we need is inside the <em>bakeware/bakeware </em>directory.</p>



<p>To see Bakeware<em> </em>in action, let’s create a new Phoenix project called <em>counter</em>, with <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LiveView</a> support and without <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecto</a>.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ mix phx.new counter --live --no-ecto
...
$ cd counter
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>In the <code>counter</code> Phoenix project’s directory, we create a <code>lib/counter_web/live/counter_live.ex</code> file where we define a <code>CounterWeb.CounterLive</code> live view. You can can simply copy/paste the module’s code below.</p>



<div><pre><code>#lib/counter_web/live/counter_live.ex
defmodule CounterWeb.CounterLive do
  use CounterWeb, :live_view

  @impl true
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, assign(socket, counter: 0)}
  end

  @impl true
  def render(assigns) do
    ~L"""
    &lt;h1&gt;Counter: &lt;%= @counter %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;button phx-click="dec"&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button phx-click="inc"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    """
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_event("inc", _, socket) do
    {:noreply, update(socket, :counter, &amp; &amp;1 + 1)}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_event("dec", _, socket) do
    {:noreply, update(socket, :counter, &amp; &amp;1 - 1)}
  end

end
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>and update the <code>"/"</code> live route in <code>lib/counter_web/router.ex</code>.</p>



<div><pre><code>#lib/counter_web/router.ex
defmodule CounterWeb.Router do
  use CounterWeb, :router

  ...

  scope "/", CounterWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    live "/", CounterLive, :index
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>Ok, we now have a simple LiveView counter application that we can compile with Bakeware.</p>



<figure><img src="https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_liveview_counter.gif" alt="Phoenix LiveView counter example" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Phoenix LiveView counter example</figcaption></figure>



<p>To use Bakeware we, just need to change the <code>mix.exs</code> file of our <code>counter</code> Phoenix project.</p>



<div><pre><code>#mix.exs
defmodule Counter.MixProject do
  def project do
    [
      app: :counter,
      ...
      releases: [
        baked_counter: [
          steps: [:assemble, &amp;Bakeware.assemble/1],
          strip_beams: Mix.env() == :prod,
          overwrite: true
        ]
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp aliases do
    [
      assets: ["cmd npm run deploy --prefix assets"],
      release: ["assets", "phx.digest", "release"],
      setup: ["deps.get", "cmd npm install --prefix assets"]
    ]
  end

  defp deps do
   [
    ...
    {:bakeware, path: "../bakeware/bakeware", runtime: false}
   ]
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>We first add the <code>:bakeware</code> dependency, pointing the <code>:path</code> to the local <em>bakerware</em> subfolder and setting the <code>:runtime</code> option to <code>false</code>.</p>



<p>We then add the <code>:release</code> and <code>:assets</code> aliases, which shorten the list of command we need to type to build a release. For example, the <code>:release</code> alias runs <code>mix assets</code>, <code>mix phx.digest</code> and <code>mix release</code>.</p>



<p>Most importantly, we add a <code>:releases</code> option in the keyword list returned by <code>project/0</code>. The only release we build is called <code>baked_counter</code>, and we set  <code>[:assemble, &amp;Bakeware.assemble/1]</code> as a list of <code>:steps</code> to execute when assembling the release. We set two other options: <code>overwrite: true</code> (<em>if there is an existing release version, overwrite it</em>) and <code>:strip_beams</code> which is <code>true</code> only when the environment is <code>prod</code> (<em>controls if BEAM files should have their debug information, documentation chunks, and other non-essential metadata removed</em>).</p>



<p>Remember to add the <code>server: true</code> option to the <code>CounterWeb.Endpoint</code> production config, in <code>config/prod.exs</code></p>



<div><pre><code>#config/prod.exs

config :counter, CounterWeb.Endpoint,
  ...
  server: true,
  check_origin: false
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>When Setting <code>server: true</code> the web server is started when the endpoint supervision tree starts. We can also add <code>check_origin: false</code>, which disables the check of the origin header.</p>



<p>We are ready to build the release. Before running the <code>mix</code> tasks, we need to <code>SECRET_KEY_BASE</code> env variables.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ mix phx.gen.secret
y0RanKUeQ641fq8Mzh/sa0WwuVoBxwqVrgsXM+aGPrtpYRZwwuyoRRZpomw8ALqJ
$ export SECRET_KEY_BASE="y0RanKUeQ641fq8Mzh/sa0WwuVoBxwqVrgsXM+aGPrtpYRZwwuyoRRZpomw8ALqJ"
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>And then we run the <code>setup</code> and <code>release</code> mix tasks, setting the <code>MIX_ENV</code> env variable to <code>prod</code>.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ MIX_ENV=prod mix setup
...
$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release
...
* assembling bakeware baked_counter
Bakeware successfully assembled executable \
at _build/prod/rel/bakeware/baked_counter
</code></pre>

<h2>How does Bakeware work?</h2>



<p>The executable binary, built by Bakeware, has the whole release compressed in it. When we run it, it extracts everything in a cache folder, and starts the application.</p>



<p>To optimize the start-time, Bakeware maintains a cache of extracted binaries and assets. In this way, the second time we run it, it’s faster since it doesn’t need to uncompress anything.</p>



<p>The cache directory location is system-specific:</p>



<ul><li>on macOS is <code>"~/Library/Caches/Bakeware"</code></li><li>on Linux and other Unixes is <code>"~/.cache/bakeware"</code></li><li>on Windows is <code>"C:/Users/&lt;USER&gt;/AppData/Local/Bakeware/cache"</code></li></ul>



<p>In this case, I’m on a mac. If we go in the <code>~/Library/Caches/Bakeware/6ea5f...</code> folder, we find the extracted release.</p>

<p>And under <code>lib/counter-1.0/priv/static</code> we the app static assets.</p>



<h2>Share the app with another computer</h2>



<p>Let’s try the <code>baked_counter</code> on another mac. If you built your app on Linux, it should work on other similar Linux environments. Windows support is coming (take a look at the end of the article). </p>



<p>I’ve compiled it with my MacBook Pro with Catalina (10.15.7), so it would be nice to see if it works on a slightly older macOS version, like Mojave (10.14). I don’t have another Mac, so I use a remote macmini with macOS 10.14, hosted by MacinCloud, with a pay-as-you-go plan.</p>

<p>And it works!! Is it compatible across many OS versions? Well… it depends by different things. When we build a release this is supposed to run on a target machine with the same operating system with a <em>similar</em> environment, like C runtime and other libraries referenced by the Erlang runtime and any NIFs and ports in the application.</p>



<h2>Wrap Up</h2>



<p>This is a project started just a month ago, and the team has planned to work on many other things, like for example:</p>



<ul><li>&lt;&lt;<a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/issues/37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Windows support seems to be not too far off!</a>&gt;&gt;</li><li>&lt;&lt;<a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cross-compilation is something to consider as a future feature</a>&gt;&gt;</li></ul>



<p>Do you think Bakeware is going to be helpful for you? Maybe for a CLI written in Elixir? Or a Scenic, or Phoenix app with LiveView? Let me know what you think!</p>

The name? <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> of course! Now, we bet that you haven’t seen this one yet — at least not in a standard calculus textbook or <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus?t=table-of-contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a> anyway!</p><h2 id="theory"><span id="Exponent_Rule_for_Derivative_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Exponent Rule for Derivative — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p>Given a <strong>base function</strong>&nbsp;$f$ and an <strong>exponent function</strong> $g$ — both defined on an interval $I$ — one&nbsp;can construct&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>power function</strong>&nbsp;$f^g$ (i.e., $f$ raised to $g$),&nbsp;which is defined as long as&nbsp;$f(x)&gt;0$ on $I$ (<a href="https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/#terms">why?</a>).

With the advent of the Exponent Rule, both of these approaches basically become obsolete — not because they are irrelevant per se, but because they&nbsp;have&nbsp;already been carried out&nbsp;<em>during</em> the derivation of the Exponent Rule.</p><p>In what follows, we lay out&nbsp;7 examples illustrating how the Exponent Rule can be used to&nbsp;<em>streamline</em> the differentiation process for <strong>power functions</strong>, thereby freeing up some of our brainpower and resources&nbsp;to other potentially-more-challenging tasks that are yet to come.</p><h3 id="ex1"><span id="Example_1_%E2%80%94_$%5Cpi%5Ex$"></span><a href="#toc">Example 1 — $\pi^x$</a><span></span></h3><p>With the base function being $\pi$ and the exponent function $x$, the exponential function $\pi^x$ — which is defined on the <em>entire</em> real line&nbsp;— easily satisfies the <em>preconditions</em> laid out by the Exponent Rule. In which case, differentiating it using the Rule yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} (\pi^x)’ &amp; = \pi^x \left[ (x)’ \ln \pi + (\pi)’ \frac{x}{\pi} \right] = \pi^x \ln \pi \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})\end{align*}</p><p>which shows that $\pi^x$ differentiates to itself along&nbsp;with&nbsp;some&nbsp;<em>adjustment factor</em> — a typical behavior among the&nbsp;exponential functions.</p><p>Now, is that a&nbsp;<em>heavy-handed</em> differentiation approach to a&nbsp;particularly-simple function? Actually, not really, for as it turns out, the alternative approaches would have been essentially the same&nbsp;— save perhaps a few more extra <em>“patching” steps</em>.</p><p>Finally, to&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;our first <em>successful</em> execution of the Exponent Rule, we’ve cooked up the graphs of $\pi^x$ and its derivative here:</p><figure id="attachment_6618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6618"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/pi^x.png" alt="The exponential function pi^x (red) and its derivative (green)" width="1020" height="716" title=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6618">$\pi^x$ in <span>red</span>, and its derivative in <span>green</span>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <h4><strong>Data-driven software is the future. This shift is bringing about a new category of tools—what we call model performance monitoring (MPM).</strong></h4><p>&nbsp;<br>As we dig into the model performance monitoring market we’ve been asking ourselves: what can we learn from the evolution of application monitoring that might apply to data science? How is it different and what do we look for in this new set of tools?</p><p>Over the past two decades, there has been a wave of application performance monitoring (APM) companies that has fundamentally changed the course of software development; Datadog, New Relic, PagerDuty, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, and Splunk have created nearly $90B in market cap and growing. APM has enabled companies to prevent outages, monitor uptime, and ultimately has catalyzed digital transformation and the migration to cloud. These days it is difficult to imagine mission-critical software that relies on manual troubleshooting and spot-checking instead of systematic tooling. But such ad-hoc, unscalable workflows are shockingly commonplace in the world of machine learning systems.*</p><p>Much like cloud-native computing has ushered in a new era of software development and tooling, we believe data-driven systems, enabled by machine learning, have the power to unlock the next wave of innovation. In turn, we believe there will be a need for an analogous set of model performance monitoring (MPM) tools to help with data quality, drift, model performance, and system reliability. Companies like WhyLabs, Toro Data, Mona Labs, Monte Carlo Data, LightUp, Soda Data, among many others,&nbsp;are just beginning to capitalize on what we see as a multi-decade long trend.</p> </div></div><div><div> <h3><b>Why now?</b></h3><p>If we look at the history of APM, the first wave came about in the late 1990s, following the rapid adoption of Java. Even though the applications built with Java were fairly simple, software-first companies recognized a need to manage performance. Thus, early companies like Wily Technology were born.</p><p>The second generation of APM, catalyzed by the rise of the cloud and service-oriented architectures (SOA) in the 2000s, grew much larger. While new architectures offered the benefits of modularity, speed, and the development of more sophisticated software applications, they were also significantly more complex to manage. It took “moments of truth” – when these sophisticated, mission-critical systems failed – for companies to realize the importance of monitoring.</p><p>These tailwinds led to the creation of many of the widely-used APM solutions we know today—New Relic, Datadog, and many others.</p><p>In many ways, machine learning systems are the most complex systems we’ve seen to date, and these complex systems have become mission-critical to many companies. Uber depends on algorithms to automatically predict and price demand for rides. Netflix’s recommendation engine powers its core user experience. And the performance of the AI models in Tesla self-driving cars can save lives. The list goes on.</p><p>From Amazon to Facebook, we have learned about the sheer impact performance issues in machine learning systems can cause to a company. In the last 8 months alone, we’ve seen massive issues for business-critical models that have left companies scrambling to fix corrupted models. Instacart, for example, saw their inventory prediction models go haywire due to COVID-related consumer behavior changes. Accuracy declined from <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/09/instacart-coronavirus-artificial-intelligence/">93% to 61%</a>, misguiding shoppers and frustrating customers whose product purchases were unable to be fulfilled.</p><p>Similar to APM in the 2000s, as machine learning systems have introduced new complexity (and potential) to the tech stack, we are starting to see an increase in these “moment of truth” events for data-driven software. Solutions to monitor these critical machine learning systems are needed. Yesterday.</p><h3><b>Challenges and Opportunities</b></h3><p>Traditional software is deterministic. Machine learning systems are probabilistic. This creates a double-edged sword for models.</p><p>Models in production, if well-maintained, can get better over time—as data grows, its predictive power increases. The dangerous flip side is that models can degrade the moment you push them into production. The core reason for this is that <strong><em>“drift”</em></strong> can occur, that is, unexpected and/or undocumented changes in your data structure, semantics and other statistical properties that cause model degradation. Though drift occurs naturally, because data always changes in the real world, drift can be severe and lead to significant, often unobservable machine learning system “outages.”</p><p>This also means there are a few unique and complex challenges MPM must overcome. First, models often fail silently. In other words, the equivalent of software outages and error response codes (404s, 500s, etc) don’t exist in machine learning systems today. Second, given the probabilistic nature of machine learning systems, KPIs are harder to define “out-of-the-box.” Finally, as a result, corrective actions for machine systems are not as clear-cut (e.g. can’t just say “add more processing power” to solve overloaded CPU). With these considerations in mind, we categorize machine learning monitoring into three core areas: <strong>data, model, and code</strong>.</p> </div></div><div><div> <p><strong>Data (i.e. model input monitoring)</strong>:<em> Are the data and statistical properties what we expected?</em> Data should be monitored for both quality and drift. Data quality issues arise because data values may be broken (e.g. missing, erroneous, or don’t fall within expected ranges) or there is a divergence from expected schemas. Data drift occurs when production data diverge from the model’s original training data or the distribution of your data changes such that your model is less representative.</p><p><strong>Model (i.e. prediction monitoring)</strong>: <em>Are my predictions still accurate and relevant?</em> Often, there is a time delta between your prediction and what you aim to predict. In other words, it might take weeks to learn the real-world facts and realize that predictions aren’t accurate. In this case, you should monitor to compare distributions and prediction probabilities. If the time delta is not an issue, simpler monitoring methods (e.g. checking for accuracy, overfit, or bias that was not found during training) can be deployed.</p><p><strong>Code (i.e. system-wide, operational concerns)</strong>: <em>Is our system performant and reliable?</em> Similar to APM, we should monitor for latency when calling machine learning API endpoints, memory/CPU usage when performing predictions, and disk utilization. Upstream feature engineering should also be monitored for changes that might affect the weights or relevance of features used in production models.</p><h3><b>The Market</b></h3><p>Though MPM as a category is still very nascent, we believe that the market will grow faster and could eventually be larger than APM in the next decade. We have several reasons for this hypothesis. First, MPM startups are already seeing annual contract values (ACVs) that are larger than the early contracts of their APM counterparts (e.g. New Relic had $8k ACVs at IPO according to their S1). This makes sense intuitively given that model monitoring is a much harder, and therefore more expensive problem to solve. End-to-end machine learning pipelines are complex. They often involve many different datasets, utilize several different tools for processes like cleansing and ETL, and are distributed over multiple infrastructure providers. The best MPM products will be able to find errors at the application layer that may be invisible to an end user and even to the application developer themselves.</p><p>Moreover, we think MPM solutions will be needed much earlier in the lifecycle of a software business. In APM, solutions are only needed once a business has shipped a complex application distributed over multiple clouds or microservices. Most small and medium-sized software companies do not procure an APM solution. For MPM on the other hand, we are seeing adoption from a wide range of buyers, from small startups to multi-billion dollar enterprises. Machine learning models, whether they are serving 1 or 1 million end users in production, will need monitoring from day 0. We therefore think the number of potential customers for MPM solutions will include all those currently using APM solutions, in addition to the lower end of the market. In fact, many of the current modern APM solutions are now <a href="https://newrelic.com/resources/white-papers/accelerate-incident-response-with-aiops">leveraging machine learning</a> in their products – APM businesses themselves need MPM solutions!</p><p>This combination of potentially larger ACVs and a larger universe of addressable customers leads us to believe that the market opportunity for MPM is massive. According to Gartner, APM is a <a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/15-top-application-performance-monitoring-vendors-gartner-547297#:~:text=The%20APM%20market%20is%20one,over%20the%20next%20three%20years.">$4.5b</a> market growing at an 11% CAGR. We believe that the MPM market will be at least double this size and will grow twice as fast over the next decade.</p><h3><b>Six Keys to Winning The Model Performance Monitoring Market</b></h3><p>After studying the parallels between the APM and MPM markets, we believe there are a few characteristics that will allow MPM companies to stand out from the pack and build valuable businesses:</p><ol><li><strong>An open ecosystem – </strong>We believe the best MPM products, similar to APM providers like Datadog, Splunk, and Elastic, will integrate with an open ecosystem of vendors, whether commercial or open source tools. Given the complexity and customization involved in building end-to-end data pipelines, the best tools will provide monitoring and observability features for many machine learning setups and use cases. They may even integrate with traditional APM providers to use logs and metrics in determining model health.</li><li><strong>Out-of-the-box value – </strong>Moreover, the best products will provide immediate out-of-the-box value and be very easy to use for different user personas, without requiring months of implementation time or custom work. As a result of a wide availability of integrations, short time-to-setup, and an intuitive UI/UX, the best products will make it easy for either a business analyst or data scientist to make well informed, quick decisions on how to fix models in production.</li><li><strong>Bottoms-up adoption – </strong>We believe …</li></ol></div></div></div>

  <p>Both Flask and Django are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web frameworks</li>
<li>Coded on python</li>
<li>Opensource products with great communities</li>
<li>Both could be used for Server Side Rendering (for SEO purposes) or building REST APIs (e.g. JSON)</li>
<li>Both have blocking programming model which require multi-thread/multi-process runners like gunicorn to deploy</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is the difference Flask vs Django? TL;DR:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Django is an all-in-one box: Relational DB ORM + Migrations, Template rendering system, Security middleware, User management built-in application, configurable CRUD admin panel</li>
<li>Flask is microframework - you have to install and configure all packages for required features by yourself, configure the project and automotive pipelines, you will spend much more time on doing it for each new project</li>
</ul>

              <img alt="" src="https://s.hinty.io/BKEsDx6GW3JnKfxYdsnQEW.png"></picture></a></p><h2>Django Internal ORM</h2>
<p>1. Define the model in <code>models.py</code> with e.g.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>30</span><span>)</span>
    <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>IntegerField</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>2. Run <code>python manage.py makemigrations</code><br>
3. Run <code>python manage.py migrate</code><br>
That is all it will generate <code>CREATE TABLE</code> SQL statement and execute it under the hood to sync your models to database</p>
<p>Then just do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Alex Kotli"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>=</span><span>28</span><span>)</span>
<span>p</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And it will do <code>INSERT</code> SQL query under the hood. Do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>Person</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>age__gt</span><span>=</span><span>18</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And it will do <code>SELECT</code> SQL which will return return an iterable with all persons with age grater then 18.</p>
<h2>Flask vs Django ORM</h2>
<p>Flask doesn't has ORM.<br>
You can <code>pip install</code> side-vendor ORM  <code>SQLAlchemey</code>, and then connect it by imports/flask-plugins. But SQLA is without migrations, you will then need an Alembic for migrations, and then you will need to configure it.</p>
<h2>Django admin area</h2>
<p>Create boilerplate app, run <code>python manage.py createsuperuser</code> and then log in to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/</code>:</p>

<h2>What to choose in flask vs django?</h2>
<p>Make your choice by considering one by one all pros and cones.</p>
<h3>Django benefits, Flask disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Django will give you an all-in-one solution which will give you everything needed to build great web apps, on Flask you will have to do a lot of extra jobs to gather all things together</li>
<li>Django is much faster in terms of development time, but only when you have experience working with it. Flask is faster if you never did web programming</li>
<li>Django will cover you from security attacks if you follow recommendations and not doing stupid things that reduce security level, like (removing CSRF protection instead of implementing it, removing cors, disabling hostname check). On Flask you will have to be aware about the most common web vulnerabilities and will have to find packages to implement it by yourself</li>
<li>Most of Django libraries (e.g. OAuth sign up) are much easier in use, have more features, and are more up-to-date</li>
<li>Django implements a secure login system for you</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flask pros, Django cones</h3>
<ul>
<li>You have to learn Django longer when flask ready to serve http requests after pip/pipenv install</li>
<li>With Flask you will use more external libraries which could be then used in other e.g. non-web python apps - free experience</li>
<li>More lightweight apps, but it will not give you a performance boost (you will save only a couple of CPU loops), most issues come with heavy and joined DB requests without indexes which could happen on both frameworks when you don't analyze the performance</li>
<li>You are flexible to implement some different methods e.g. Django uses sessions over coockie when you can craft your own JWT way to handle Authorisation, again with a huge risk of security attaks if you do a small mistake</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I think we need a protocol for storing and accessing an individual's data on the web. If it became widely adopted, open-source web applications would become more prevalent, and we'd be able to achieve the goals described in <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech" target="_blank">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>.</p><p>Here's a simple proposal which I'll call GitCMS. It relies on Git, <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn" target="_blank">EDN</a>, and <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/spec" target="_blank">Clojure Spec</a>. It has similarities with the <a href="https://solidproject.org/" target="_blank">Solid project</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank">IPFS</a>, but GitCMS's scope is much smaller.</p><p>(For those unfamiliar with Clojure: EDN is basically an improved version of JSON, and Spec is a language for defining schemas.)</p><h2 id="core-proposal">Core proposal</h2><h3 id="storage-and-data-model">Storage and data model</h3><p>Each user has at least one Git repo, in which each file contains a single document. The document is stored as an EDN map, optionally followed by a blank line and some text. For example, my repo might contain a blog post in the file <code>/blog/some-blog-post</code>:</p><pre><code>{:type      :article
 :title     "Some Blog Post"
 :published #inst "2020-10-10"}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</code></pre><p>When reading, this file would be deserialized to:</p><pre><code>{:type      :article
 :title     "Some Blog Post"
 :published #inst "2020-10-10"
 :path      "/blog/some-blog-post"
 :text      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."}
</code></pre><p><code>:path</code> is the primary key.</p><p>These documents could be used for any kind of data. Besides modeling content you've created, you could model other content you've interacted with. If you like a Tweet, you might model that like so:</p><pre><code>{:path   "/events/&lt;some uuid&gt;"
 :type   :rating
 :url    "..."
 :rating :like
 :date   #inst "..."}
</code></pre><p>For large files like images or videos, or frequently changing files like collaborative documents, you could store just the metadata and a foreign key/URL pointing to the content.</p><p>The community could maintain a special repository that contains schemas, defined with Spec. For example:</p><pre><code>(ns example.schemas
  (:require
    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]))

(s/def :article/type #{:article})
(s/def ::title string?)
(s/def ::article
  (s/keys :req-un [:article/type
                   ::title
                   ...]))
</code></pre><p>In English: to be an article, a document must have a <code>:type</code> key set to <code>:article</code>, it must have a <code>:title</code> key set to a string, etc.</p><p>So if you want to make an application that publishes a user's blog posts, you would filter through their repo for any documents that match the spec for articles.</p><p>(If your app is written in Clojure, you can use the official Spec definitions directly, but that's not required. They're just a reference implementation. The schemas don't even have to be written with Spec, but that seems like a flexible, concise, unambiguous way to do it.)</p><h3 id="access">Access</h3><p>To make an application that reads GitCMS data, just ask the user for their repo's URL. If you need write access, ask the user for an SSH key (on Github, "Deploy key"). As a user, you can make additional repos for more granular access control (e.g. besides a public repo, you could have a private repo which requires an SSH key for read access).</p><p>For more convenient and finer-grained control, there could be applications which have full access to your repo and provide an OAuth API for other apps. These API layers could do more things too, like maintain an index of your data in order to provide efficient queries. The specifics don't need to be part of the GitCMS protocol.</p><p>Git also lends itself well to change data capture. Applications can poll (or use Git hooks) for new commits. Given a batch of new commits, you can easily see which documents have been created, updated or deleted.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><h3 id="do-one-thing-and-do-it-well">Do one thing and do it well</h3><p>I'll use Jira as an example. Jira was not loved at my previous job. My project manager said it was popular mainly because it was the only issue tracker that did everything. (If you disagree, think of some other web app that does many things poorly).</p><p>With GitCMS, you can easily have multiple apps that operate on the same data, without API integrations. You could have one app for creating new issues and a separate app for displaying those issues. Poor features, instead of being tolerated, can be replaced with small, specialized apps.</p><p>This would also lower the barrier to entry for individual developers and startups: instead of having to make an app that's good enough to displace an incumbent, you can make a small app that only replaces one feature. And you can do this without plugging into (and thus, becoming dependent on) a commercial platform.</p><h3 id="open-data">Open data</h3><p>Information discovery is one of the most important problems of our time. If everyone used GitCMS to store data about content they like and don't like, then anyone could use it to build search engines, recommender systems and social networks.</p><h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2><p>Getting people to use any new protocol is hard, but I think GitCMS has a real chance to succeed. Git is widely used and understood, and there's plenty of free hosting. Plus it's convenient for developers: you can perform CRUD operations with just a text editor. Even without widespread adoption, GitCMS would be a nice data storage format for many side projects, like static site generators. GitCMS will benefit from network effects, but it can get started without them.</p><p>As early adopters build side projects on GitCMS, the main driver for adoption can become the apps, not the protocol per se. "Come for the apps, stay for the protocol."</p><p>If GitCMS becomes popular among developers, it can spread to non-technical people with some extra work. At the least, we would need a hosting service designed for this purpose instead of GitHub et. al.</p><p>The choice of EDN instead of JSON will probably hinder adoption, except among Clojure programmers. However I think the advantages of EDN are significant, and switching to it late-stage would be difficult. So I'm confident that this indulgence is worth it. It'd be good to survey the state of <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn/wiki/Implementations" target="_blank">EDN implementations</a> and see if any could use some help.</p><p>I personally got chills when the idea for GitCMS coalesced in my mind, so I'll be using it for my future side projects (which I will no doubt promote as "X, built on GitCMS"). I'll also let Findka users expose their favorited articles in an RSS feed, which can then be auto-imported into GitCMS. If you want to use GitCMS, let me know (you can find contact info and social media profiles on <a href="https://jacobobryant.com/" target="_blank">my website</a>). If others are interested, I could set up a mailing list.</p><p>View discussions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/jg3yx7/how_git_could_help_save_the_open_web/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/planetclojure/status/1319333691471134722" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p></div></div>]]>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		
<p><em>Sorry if this comes off as an ad for Apple or something. I’m usually <a href="https://spencerdailey.com/2020/02/28/how-apple-can-navigate-its-touchy-touch-bar-dilemma/">pretty</a> <a href="https://spencerdailey.com/2020/01/16/the-key-takeaway-from-developing-for-the-mac-app-store-its-unreliable/">critical</a> <a href="https://spencerdailey.com/2019/06/07/google-maps-app-should-let-you-lock-the-ui-in-portrait-mode/">of</a> <a href="https://spencerdailey.com/2018/12/26/in-2019-apple-needs-to-change-iphones-call-ui-because-robocalls-are-killing-us/">Apple</a>, it’s just I feel like a hobby of mine has been significantly improved, and sometimes adding the right gadget can do that.</em></p>



<p>For years I’ve relied on jogging as a primary means of creating quiet space to think.</p>



<p>I consider any time without a phone as sacred. For me, the main ones are: showering, driving, pre-sleep time (having a spouse has thankfully cut down my in-bed phone gazing habit), and jogging. You may have other examples such as yoga, meditation, swimming, strolling, bird watching, reading a book… etc.</p>



<p>Paul Graham has written about the value of separating oneself from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/distraction.html">distracting</a> screens, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1222898837330657286">ideating on walks</a>. And Hacker News has circulated the notion that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14639967">mere</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24519684">presence</a> of a smartphone can limit one’s cognitive capacity. </p>



<p>Because smartphones are so strongly tied to media <em>consumption</em>, I think my creative brain is conditioned to power down when I’m looking at one. So when I leave home on a run, I don’t take the iPhone with me. (This does create some safety issues, which I talk about <a href="#safety">later</a>.)</p>



<p>One principle to successful 🏃‍♂️ brainstorming on jogs I’ve found is offloading ideas soon after they’re formed (otherwise I spend the rest of the jog worried I’ll forget them). This means note-taking is essential to a fun run.  Without a smartphone companion, for many years my go-to was the sweat-proof <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/aquanotes">Aqua Notes</a>, which could follow me into the post-jog shower. 👍</p>



<p>The Apple Watch has a decent microphone and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/audio-memos/id338550388">voice memo app</a> support, unlike most other fitness/smart-watches. This potentially makes it an excellent note-taking device for joggers. </p>



<p>Isn’t adding another device to the mix just creating another distraction? I don’t activate the cellular option and I have notifications turned off, so it really can’t be a content consumption device on a jog. Even Paul Graham’s essay on reducing distraction included having a second, limited-and-purposeful computer. </p>



<p>The device has to be comfortable to wear or else it’s just as distracting as carrying an iPhone.</p>



<p>And comfort was an issue for me with the Apple Watch Series 4 (which I returned), but while trying the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE,</a> I came to a realization: <strong>using an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/B-Great-Breathable-Armband-Compatible-Apple/dp/B07G2G68XB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1">armband</a> instead of a wristband</strong> was a gamechanger for ergonomics. For starters, the above-elbow area is experiencing less motion, so the tug of the watch is noticeably less after each step. The band’s grip is also spread out over a larger area, so it can be made tighter than on the wrist without being too painful. This means the Watch is securely fastened and not drawing attention to itself.</p>



<p>In practice you’re usually two taps away from taking a note (one tap on the watchface shortcut and another on the “Record” button).  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="832" src="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-1024x832.png" alt="" srcset="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-1024x832.png 1024w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-300x244.png 300w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-768x624.png 768w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-1536x1247.png 1536w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-982x798.png 982w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-400x325.png 400w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM.png 1810w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Once you’ve made it home, the notes automatically sync back to your iPhone, which is pretty seamless. </p>



<p>Overall, using voice memos on the Watch has been far less cumbersome than taking physical notes (resulting in faster-paced runs) and led to far more (and more detailed) memos.</p>



<p>Other thoughts on the Watch:</p>



<h5 id="safety">Safety</h5>



<p>Having a run-in with a (prime biting-age) Rottweiler on a recent jog convinced me of the value of being able to call emergency services in a pinch. Is jogging a high-risk activity? It depends. If it’s done enough days out of the year, the area under the risk curve is significant. I think in most regions (if you have the cellular model) you’ll be able to reach emergency services without necessarily having to pay $10/month to a carrier. That was a nice surprise.</p>



<p>Speaking of cost: the SE is sold at a palatable price point ($279). The oxygen sensor and ECG of the S6 don’t improve the device as a jogging companion, so I’d rather pocket the difference ($120).</p>



<p>Taking pulse readings while wearing on the arm seems to still be pretty accurate (within a few BPM of this finger-worn <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Zacurate-Pro-Series-500DL-Sporting-Aviation-Fingertip-Pulse-Oximeter-Blood-Oxygen-Saturation-Monitor-silicon-cover-batteries-lanyard-Mystic-Purple/55456580?athcpid=55456580&amp;athpgid=athenaItemPage&amp;athcgid=null&amp;athznid=PWVUB&amp;athieid=v0&amp;athstid=CS020&amp;athguid=42859857-007-1754d66c6c3262&amp;athancid=null&amp;athena=true">device</a>).</p>



<p>So, if you like brainstorming on jogs, I recommend the Apple Watch SE.</p>

<p><a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal</a> enables developers to build highly reliable applications without having to worry about all the edge cases. If you are new to Temporal, check out my article <a href="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/temporal-open-source-workflows-as-code/">Open Source Workflows as Code</a>. Now that you’re excited, I’ll cover how you can get up and running with Temporal.</p>

<p>Temporal consists of several components. In this post, I want to outline the primary building blocks and their interactions. By the end, you’ll have a broad picture of Temporal and the considerations of deploying to development, staging, and production environments.</p>

<h2 id="workers">Workers</h2>

<p>Workers are compute nodes that run your Temporal application code. You compile your workflows and activities into a worker executable. Next you can run the worker executable in the background and it will listen for new tasks to process.</p>

<p>Your first development environment will probably only need one worker that runs both workflows and activities in a single process. The worker can be hosted anywhere you wish: as a local process on your laptop, as an AWS Fargate task, as a pod in Kubernetes, and so on.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/worker.png" alt="A Temporal worker executes workflows and activities">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>A Temporal worker executes workflows and activities</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Production deployments typically run numerous workflows with significant load, so you will likely need to run multiple workers in parallel. Ensuring that nodes are spread out over a compute cluster enables resiliency and scalability.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/workers.png" alt="Workload scaled out to several Temporal workers">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Workload scaled out to several Temporal workers</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Workers operate independently, each crunching through its share of the workload. Workers are logically “stateless”: they don’t keep track of the past and future. Workers don’t talk to each other directly, but they coordinate via a central Temporal service—the brain of the system.</p>

<h2 id="temporal-service">Temporal Service</h2>

<p>Temporal Service is a component provided by Temporal. Its purpose is to keep track of workflows, activities, and tasks and coordinate workers’ execution.</p>

<p>Your early environments may have a single Service instance running in the background. A worker knows the Service’s domain name (IP) and port and connects to the Service via gRPC.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/service.png" alt="Worker interacting with Temporal Service">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Worker interacting with Temporal Service</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Temporal Service itself consists of multiple components: a front-end, matching, history, and others. However, it’s okay to treat it as a black-box “Service” for now.</p>

<p>Once you start growing your workloads, you will need to scale the Service components out to multiple instances for high resilience and throughput. So, several workers are now talking to several service instances.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/services.png" alt="Temporal Cluster running multiple components">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Temporal Cluster running multiple components</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Temporal Service can tolerate node failures because it stores its state in an external storage.</p>

<h2 id="data-store">Data Store</h2>

<p>All the workflow data—task queues, execution state, activity logs—are stored in a persistent Data Store. Persistence technology is pluggable with two options currently officially supported: Cassandra and MySQL. More alternatives, including PostgreSQL, are on the way.</p>

<p>A MySQL database completes the simplest Temporal deployment diagram.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/mysql.png" alt="MySQL as a Data Store for Temporal">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>MySQL as a Data Store for Temporal</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>For heavily distributed applications that experience high load, it may be better to use Cassandra instead. This database could be a cluster managed by yourself or a managed cloud service (like Azure Cosmos DB):</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/cassandra.png" alt="Cassandra as a Data Store for Temporal">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Cassandra as a Data Store for Temporal</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Your code never interacts with the Data Store directly. Basically, it’s a (rather important) implementation detail of the Temporal Service.</p>

<h2 id="temporal-web-console">Temporal Web Console</h2>

<p>Temporal provides a handy web console to view namespaces, workflows, and activity history. Technically, it’s not a required component—but you probably want to have it under your belt for manual inspection and troubleshooting.</p>

<p>You’ll likely have other client components, for instance, to start workflow executions.</p>

<h2 id="external-client">External Client</h2>

<p>You need a client to start your very first workflow execution. It can be the Temporal command-line interface <code>tctl</code> or any custom code that you wrote with a call to initiate a workflow using an SDK or raw gRPC.</p>

<p>Each client must connect to a Temporal Service in order to start or terminate workflows, wait for completion, list the results from the history, and so on. For instance, a web application could start a workflow execution every time it handles a particular HTTP endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="put-it-all-together">Put It All Together</h2>

<p>The following picture puts all the pieces covered above together.</p>

<p><strong>In this article, we compare the quality (objective &amp; subjective) and speed of LCEVC with H.264/AVC as its base-codec vs. H.264/AVC using FFmpeg. Let’s take a look at the experiments and the results, shall we?</strong></p>



<p><strong>The LCEVC Codec (MPEG-5 Part 2) or “Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding” is one of the three new codecs being introduced by MPEG (others being VVC and EVC). LCEVC aims at increasing compression efficiency for existing codecs at little to no increase in coding complexity by using a base bitstream and an enhancement bitstream.</strong></p>








<h2><span id="Quick_Introduction_to_LCEVC"></span><a href="https://github.com/ottverse/website/blob/master/content/post/lcevc-avc-ffmpeg-evaluation.md#what-is-the-lcevc-codec-mpeg-5-part-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>Quick Introduction to LCEVC <span></span></h2>



<p>As described in our <a href="https://ottverse.com/lcevc-mpeg5-part2-low-complexity-enhancement-video-coding-guide/">comprehensive guide to LCEVC</a>, the LCEVC codec (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding) is&nbsp;<strong>“a codec to improve other codecs”</strong>&nbsp;with a low complexity-overhead. The LCEVC codec’s output is a combination of a “base bitstream” produced by a video codec such as AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, etc. along with an enhancement layer that can be used to improve the quality of the video.</p>



<p>If the decoder/end-device supports LCEVC, the enhancement layers are decoded, else, the base codec alone is used to decode the bitstream and the video is rendered to the user. This fallback mechanism ensures backward-compatibility and encourages roll-out of the LCEVC codec without the fear of breaking the user’s experience.</p>



<p>Here is a diagrammatic representation of how LCEVC works. More details can be found in our <a href="https://ottverse.com/lcevc-mpeg5-part2-low-complexity-enhancement-video-coding-guide/">comprehensive guide to LCEVC</a> and at <a href="https://www.lcevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lcevc.com</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="Background_to_this_article"></span>Background to this article<span></span></h2>



<p>After writing an article on the LCEVC standard, I wanted to test it and see the results for myself. I got in touch with V-Nova (<em><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fabiomurra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio Murra</a>, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anthonyconcannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony Concannon</a></em>) and asked them if I can get my hands on some test software to run experiments and see the performance of LCEVC for myself. They agreed, and within a week, I started encoding using V-Nova’s LCEVC encoder and analyzing the results for myself.</p>



<p>Before we proceed with the codec evaluation, I’d like to highlight a few points.</p>



<ul><li>Encoders are complex and come with several tuning parameters designed to help you compress video to your liking and requirements. And, consequently, every codec comparison has its own idiosyncracies.</li><li>I am sure that once the LCEVC standard is released and encoder implementations enter the market, you’ll see more codec comparisons like the one presented here with different sequences, tuning parameters, presets, etc. That is the nature of codec comparisons.</li><li>I used open-source video test sequences so that others can reproduce the results I got. You can download them from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank">Xiph.org</a></li></ul>



<p>My goal here is to showcase the difference between the two codecs and give you an understanding of what gains are there to be had if you use LCEVC.</p>



<p>With that short introduction, let’s get down to business and see how LCEVC fares in comparison to H.264/AVC.</p>



<h2><span id="Experiment_Setup"></span>Experiment Setup<span></span></h2>



<h3><span id="Test_Video_Sequences"></span>Test Video Sequences<span></span></h3>



<p>I chose two popular test videos to test LCEVC. They are –</p>



<p><strong>1. Park Joy, 50 fps, 1080p</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="667" data-permalink="https://ottverse.com/lcevc-vs-avc-using-ffmpeg/parkjoy/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?fit=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="768,432" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="parkjoy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?fit=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="768" height="432" src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="parkjoy lcevc" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>ParkJoy is a favorite among video compression teams, and it is interesting because of how the camera follows the actors. The camera movement gives an illusion of the people running in place with the background moving around them. ParkJoy is also characterized by highly textured grass, water, and trees that appear suddenly and close to the camera. All these elements make it a problematic sequence to compress, making the ParkJoy sequence interesting.

<p><strong>2. CrowdRun, 50 fps, 1080p</strong></p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="721" data-permalink="https://ottverse.com/lcevc-vs-avc-using-ffmpeg/crowd-run/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?fit=1152%2C648&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1152,648" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="crowd-run" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?w=1152&amp;ssl=1 1152w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The CrowdRun sequence (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/">download from xiph</a>) is also popular because it has so many different elements that are hard to compress. There are sections of grass with fine details, a whole lot of people running in one direction (with clearly visible facial expressions), a tree right in the middle of the scene, and a lot of texture in the background (trees, clouds, etc.). Everything that’s needed to trouble an encoder is here!</p>



<h3><span id="Software"></span>Software<span></span></h3>



<p>V-Nova provided me with an FFmpeg build (4.3.1) with LCEVC enabled. It hasn’t been released to the public yet, but if you are interested in getting your hands on an LCEVC encoder and decoder, please reach out to the V-Nova team, and they’ll help you out.</p>



<p>Note: you need both an LCEVC-enabled encoder and decoder to test LCEVC which is what V-Nova gave me (<code>ffmpeg</code> and <code>ffplay</code> with LCEVC enabled).</p>



<h3><span id="Process"></span>Process<span></span></h3>



<p>As with all codec analysis, I ran the chosen sequences through the <strong>LCEVC encoder with H.264/AVC (libx264) as its base-codec and then ran the same sequence through <strong>H.264/</strong>AVC (libx264) using a range of bitrates in CBR mode</strong>. </p>



<p>The inputs are 1080p @ 50 fps and the same is retained for the output (1080p50).</p>



<p>I disabled tuning (<code>vmaf</code>, <code>psnr</code>, etc.) and chose a 1 sec GOP size for the experiments.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation: </strong></p>



<ol><li>I computed the PSNR and VMAF values at different bitrates and used them to evaluate the codecs objectively.</li><li>I did side-by-side visual comparisons to judge which codec did better. There are screenshots pasted below to show you what I saw. </li></ol>



<p>Ok, let’s look at the tests and results now. </p>



<h2><span id="ParkJoy_LCEVC_vs_AVC"></span>ParkJoy: LCEVC vs. AVC<span></span></h2>



<h3><span id="Expt_1_CBR_using_an_IPPP_Structure_(no_Bpictures)"></span>Expt 1. CBR using an IPPP Structure (no B-pictures)<span></span></h3>



<p>For the first set of experiments, I chose a simple “IPPP” GOP structure without any B-pictures. With this fixed GOP structure, I was able to take any scene-change detection, or dynamic-GOP-length (or mini-GOP) decision algorithms out of the picture, and keep the focus purely on the way the two codecs are designed.</p>



<p>Here is an example of encoding with LCEVC using FFmpeg. You need to specify a set of parameters called the <code>eil_params</code> that are then transmitted to the base codec which is H.264/AVC (libx264) in this case.</p>



<p>For example, in the command line below, I instruct the base codec to disable B pictures, to use CBR encoding, disable scenecut detection, and use the <code>veryslow</code> preset. The <code>threads 1</code> is to ensure repeatability between H.264/AVC encodes (LCEVC is deterministic). </p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: For speed comparisons, <code>threads 1</code> is disabled. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v lcevc_h264 -base_encoder x264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -eil_params "rc_pcrf_base_rc_mode=cbr;bframes=0;preset=veryslow;rc_pcrf_ipp_mode=1;scenecut=0"  parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_lcevc_ipp.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The equivalent AVC command line is – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v libx264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -bufsize 1200k -maxrate 1200k -sc_threshold 0 -preset veryslow -bf 0  parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_avc_ipp.mp4</code></pre>



<p>After repeating the encodes over a range of bitrates, I plotted the PSNR and VMAF values and here are the plots. </p>

<p>The RD-Plot above shows a substantial gain for LCEVC vs. vanilla H.264/AVC. At very high bitrates, the PSNR values converge, but, at lower bitrates, the gap is substantial. </p>



<p>If we compute the BD-Rate using the PSNR-Bitrate data, <strong>we get a value of <code>-28.07%</code> and this is huge</strong>. It implies that our tests were able to demonstrate that <strong>LCEVC can give a 28% average bitrate savings over H.264/AVC for equivalent video quality (computed using PSNR).  </strong></p>



<p>Here are the VMAF results plotted against the bitrate values. Again, as you can see, there is an immediate benefit to using LCEVC over AVC alone. </p>



<h3><span id="Expt_2_CBR_using_Bpictures"></span>Expt 2. CBR using B-pictures<span></span></h3>



<p>This command line is similar to what was used for the IPP mode, except, we enable B-frames. So, the encoder is allowed to use B-pictures and decide for itself, how many B-pictures to use, and where to place them. </p>



<p>The LCEVC command line is shown below. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v lcevc_h264 -base_encoder x264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -eil_params "rc_pcrf_base_rc_mode=cbr;preset=veryslow;scenecut=0" parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_lcevc.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The H.264/AVC equivalent command used is –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v libx264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -bufsize 1200k -maxrate 1200k  -preset veryslow -sc_threshold 0  parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_avc.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here are the PSNR and VMAF values plotted against the bitrates. </p>

<p>Again, as you can see, there is an immediate benefit to using LCEVC over H.264/AVC alone <strong>with a -20% BD-Rate value that indicates a savings of 20% for LCEVC over AVC at equivalent video quality.</strong></p>



<p>Now, let’s switch over to the CrowdRun sequence and repeat these tests.</p>



<h2><span id="CrowdRun_%E2%80%93_LCEVC_vs_AVC"></span>CrowdRun – LCEVC vs AVC<span></span></h2>



<p>I then repeated the experiments using the CrowdRun sequence, 1080p50 with the output being 1080p50. </p>



<h3><span id="Expt_1_CBR_using_an_IPPP_Structure_(no_Bpictures)-2"></span>Expt 1. CBR using an IPPP Structure (no B-pictures)<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are the results for the CrowdRun sequence with only P-pictures. </p>

<p>Similar to what we saw in the ParkJoy experiments, LCEVC delivers a substantial gain in terms of video quality at a given bitrate. This is backed up by the PSNR and VMAF data. </p>

<p>Again, we can see that the difference is quite obvious and that underscores the benefit of adopting the LCEVC coding standard. </p>



<p><strong>The PSNR vs Bitrate plot translates to a 24.53% bitrate savings (using BD-Rate calculations) for LCEVC over AVC at equivalent video quality. </strong></p>



<h2><span id="Screenshots"></span>Screenshots <span></span></h2>



<p><strong>Whatever the objective metrics say, I believe that visual comparison is important and has to be performed when you are comparing codecs. You cannot rely only on the objective metrics to derive your conclusions</strong></p>



<p>So, let’s take a look at screenshots from the ParkJoy and CrowdRun experiments. I took care to ensure that the same picture-types are being compared.</p>



<p>The images below are from the ParkJoy sequence encoded at 108p50, 3600 kbps. The image on the left is from the LCEVC bitstream and the image to the right is from the AVC bitstream.</p>

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>.

This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://codenotary.io/images/immudb/mascot.png" width="160px"> 
To all Gophers and data modeling wizards out there: do we have a challenge for you!!
Today we announce our first #immuchallenge coding competition - Winter 2020 Edition.
</p><p>The challenge: <strong>Design and implement a document-like data model on immudb</strong> </p>
<p>Our Open Source immudb immutable datastore builds on the traditional key-value data model guaranteeing immutability  in a quite unique manner. This simple yet generic data model provides the basis for the design of more complex and challenging immutable data models - like document-like data models.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>A document data model is composed of identifiable elements which have properties and may be related to other elements in many different ways. For more information about document data models, we've listed some helpful resources.</p>
<p>We expect a minimal functional implementation written in Go (including unit testing) - either fully integrated into immudb or as a standalone component. The new immutable document data model needs to be built on top of the immudb immutable key-value model in order to leverage immutability properties. </p>
<p>Below are the commands for getting the immudb Docker image using a Linux shell. You'll find more details about how to download and get started with immudb in our <a href="https://docs.immudb.io/jumpstart.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">developer jumpstart</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull immudb Docker Image from Docker Hub:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>docker pull codenotary/immudb:latest
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Run immudb in a container:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>docker run -it -d -p 3322:3322 -p 9497:9497 --name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest
</code></pre></div>
<p>In developing your solution, you'll have to make decisions that are related to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>API</strong> which stores and retrieves documents and provide proof of no tampering </li>
<li><strong>Data format</strong> which defines how objects are exchanged between final application and storage </li>
<li><strong>Atomicity</strong> at the level of document property, single, or multiple document </li>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong> to allow concurrent read and update operations </li>
<li><strong>Granularity</strong> of evidence to prove whether a whole document or only the document property is unchanged and untampered</li>
</ol>
<p>Please submit your solution via email to <a href="mailto:challenge@vchain.us">challenge@vchain.us</a> before December 20th, 2020, 0:00AM CST. All code submitted at a later time, will not be included in our decision process.</p>
<h2 id="competition-price-assignment-panel">Competition Price Assignment Panel</h2>
<p>Our panel is comprised of Jerónimo Irázabal, immudb maintainer and project manager, Dennis Zimmer, CTO of vChain, and Michele Meloni, immudb core developer.</p>
<p>The two winners of the competition will be announced on this page on December 22nd, 2020. We will select the best data models based on design decisions, implementation and performance as well as overall code quality. </p>
<p>Feel free to also share your approach, testing, and/or anything interesting you have learned in the #immuchallenge channel in <a href="https://open-immutability.slack.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slack</a>. </p>
<h2 id="prizes">Prizes</h2>
<ul>
<li>1st place - <strong>$750</strong> (Amazon.com Gift Card)</li>
<li>2nd place - <strong>$350</strong> (Amazon.com Gift Card)</li>

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/cpu-context-switch.svg" alt="Context Switch"></p>

<p>In this article, I would like to shortly describe the methods used
to dump and restore the different kinds of registers on 32-bit
and 64-bit x86 CPUs.  The first part will focus on General Purpose
Registers, Debug Registers and Floating-Point Registers up to the XMM
registers provided by the SSE extension.  I will explain how their
values can be obtained via the <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p>The <code>ptrace(2)</code> API is commonly used in all modern BSD systems
and Linux, as all of them derive it from the original form designed
and implemented in 4.3BSD.  The primary focus in this article is
on the FreeBSD and NetBSD systems.  Nevertheless, the users of other
Operating Systems such as OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD or Linux can still
benefit from this article as the basic principles are the same
and the code examples are intended to be easily adapted to other
platforms.</p>

<p>A single CPU (in modern hardware: CPU core or CPU thread,
if hyperthreading is available) can execute only one program thread
at a time.  In order to be able to run multiple processes and threads
quasi-simultaneously, the Operating System must perform <em>context
switching</em> — that is periodically suspend the currently running thread,
save its state, restore the saved state of another thread and resume it.
Saving and restoring the values of the processor’s registers play
an important part in context switching.  It is important that
this process is fully transparent to the process being switched,
and in a properly implemented kernel there should be no side effects
that are perceptible to the program.</p>

<p>The debugger may need to examine the register sets of the debugged
program for a number of reasons.  By inspecting the Program Counter,
it is able to determine the location in source code at which
the execution will continue, and by altering it it can control
the execution.  The Stack Pointer is necessary to introspect variables
stored on the stack, while the remaining registers can hold variables
themselves.</p>

<p>A special set of the x86 registers are the Debug Registers.  They are
not accessible to the program itself; however, they can be read
or written by the debugger.  They allow setting hardware assisted
breakpoints (instruction execute trap) on the code being executed,
and watchpoints (read and/or write operation trap) on the variables.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers-gpr">General Purpose Registers (GPR)</h2>

<h3 id="copying-gprs">Copying GPRs</h3>

<p>The term ‘General Purpose Registers’ is a bit ambiguous.
In the narrower sense, it means the few (8 on i386, 16 on amd64)
baseline registers that can be used to store arbitrary data (usually
integers or pointers).  In the wider sense it means all baseline
registers in the processor architecture, historically excluding
floating-point registers and special kinds of registers.  On x86, this
includes the ‘narrower sense’ general-purpose registers, the Program
Counter (EIP/RIP), segment registers and the flag register.</p>

<p>The majority of the General Purpose Registers can be copied directly,
e.g. using the <code>MOV</code> instruction, or pushed onto the stack
via <code>PUSH</code>.  The EIP/RIP register can be copied using the <code>LEA</code>
instruction, and restored via <code>JMP</code>.  The flag register can be pushed
onto the stack via <code>PUSHFD</code>/<code>PUSHFQ</code>, and afterwards popped from it
via <code>POPFD</code>/<code>POPFQ</code>.</p>

<p>The listing below demonstrates a program that grabs the values of all
amd64 GPRs at an arbitrary point during the execution and prints them
after returning from assembly.</p>

<h3 id="the-gpr-ptrace-2-api">The GPR ptrace(2) API</h3>

<p>Both FreeBSD and NetBSD use the <code>PT_GETREGS</code> request to get the values
of GPRs from the program, and <code>PT_SETREGS</code> to update them.
The requests take a pointer to <code>struct reg</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, both i386 and amd64 have the individual registers listed
as fields of the struct.  On NetBSD, i386 uses a regular structure,
while amd64 puts all values into an array whose indices are defined
in the headers as constants.</p>

<p>The listing below compares the structures used on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Note that NetBSD/amd64 uses a special macro.  For example,
<code>greg(rdi RDI, 0)</code> defines <code>_REG_RDI</code>.</p>

October 22, 2020 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-10-22-nickel-open-sourcing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-10-22-nickel-open-sourcing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We are making the <a href="https://www.github.com/tweag/nickel">Nickel</a> repository public. Nickel is an experimental configuration
language developed at Tweag. While this is not the time for the first
release yet, it is an occasion to talk about this project. The goal of this
post is to give a high-level overview of the project. If your curiosity is tickled
but you are left wanting to learn more, fear not, as we will publish
more blog posts on specific aspects of the language in the future. But for
now, let’s have a tour!</p>
<p>[<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the actual syntax of Nickel being still worked on, I’m freely
using as-of-yet non-existing syntax for illustrative purposes. The underlying
features are however already supported.]</p>
<h2>The inception</h2>
<p>We, at Tweag, are avid users of the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> package manager. As it
happens, the configuration language for Nix (also called Nix) is
a pretty good configuration language, and would be applicable to many
more things than just package management.</p>
<p>All in all, the Nix language is a lazy JSON with functions. It is
simple yet powerful. It is used to generate Nix’s package descriptions
but would be well
suited to write any kind of configuration (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>,
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, etc…).</p>
<p>The rub is that the interpreter for Nix-the-language is tightly
coupled with Nix-the-package manager. So, as it stands, using the
Nix language for anything else than package management is a rather
painful exercise.</p>
<p>Nickel is our attempt at answering the question: what would
Nix-the-language look like if it was split from the package manager?
While taking the opportunity to improve the language a little,
building on the experience of the Nix community over the years.</p>
<h2>What’s Nickel, exactly ?</h2>
<p>Nickel is a lightweight generic configuration language. In that it can
replace YAML as your application’s configuration language. Unlike
YAML, though, it anticipates large configurations by being
programmable. Another way to use Nickel is to generate static
configuration files — <em>e.g.</em> in JSON, YAML — that are then fed to another system. Like
Nix, it is designed to have a simple, well-understood core: at its
heart, it is JSON with functions.</p>
<p>But past experience with Nix also brings some insights on which aspects of the
language could be improved. Whatever the initial scope of a language is, it will
almost surely be used in a way that deviates from the original plan: you create
a configuration language to describe software packages, and next thing you know,
somebody needs to implement a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/11484">topological sort</a>.</p>
<p>Nickel strives to retain the simplicity of Nix, while extending it
according to this feedback.
Though, you can do perfectly fine without the new features and just write Nix-like code.</p>
<h2>Yet another configuration language</h2>
<p>At this point you’re probably wondering if this hasn’t already been done elsewhere.
It seems that more and more languages are born every day, and surely there
already exist configuration languages with a similar purpose to Nickel:
<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a>, <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> or <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>, to name
a few. So why Nickel?</p>
<h2>Typing</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important difference with other configuration languages is
Nickel’s approach to typing.</p>
<p>Some languages, such as <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a>, are not
statically typed. Indeed, static types can be seen as superflous in a configuration
language: if your program is only run once on fixed inputs, any type error will
be reported at run-time anyway. Why bother with a static type system?</p>
<p>On the other hand, more and more systems rely on complex configurations, such as
cloud infrastructure (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixops">NixOps</a>), leading the corresponding programs to become increasingly
complex, to the point where static types are beneficial. For reusable code —
that is, library functions — static types add structure, serve as
documentation, and eliminate bugs early.</p>
<p>Although less common, some configuration languages are statically typed,
including <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> and <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>.</p>
<p>Dhall features a powerful type system that is able to type a wide range of
idioms. But it is complex, requiring some experience to become fluent in.</p>
<p>CUE is closer to what we are striving for. It has an optional and well-behaved
type system with strong guarantees. In exchange for which, one can’t write nor
type higher-order functions in general, even if some simple functions are
possible to encode.</p>
<h3>Gradual typing</h3>
<p>Nickel, features a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing"><em>gradual type system</em></a>.
Gradual types are unobtrusive: they make it possible to statically
type reusable parts of your programs, but you are still free to write
configurations without any types. The
interpreter safely handles the interaction between the typed and untyped worlds.</p>
<p>Concretely, typed library code like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>// file: mylib.ncl
{
  numToStr : Num -&gt; Str = fun n =&gt; ...;
  makeURL : Str -&gt; Str -&gt; Num -&gt; Str = fun proto host port =&gt;
    "${proto}://${host}:${numToStr port}/";
}</code></pre></div>
<p>can coexist with untyped configuration code like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>// file: server.ncl
let mylib = import "mylib.ncl" in
let host = "myproject.com" in
{
  host = host;
  port = 1;
  urls = [
    mylib.makeURL "myproto" host port,
    {protocol = "proto2"; server = "sndserver.net"; port = 4242}
  ];
}</code></pre></div>
<p>In the first snippet, the body of <code>numToStr</code> and <code>makeURL</code> are statically
checked: wrongfully calling <code>numToStr proto</code> inside <code>makeURL</code> would raise an
error even if <code>makeURL</code> is never used. On the other hand, the second snippet is
not annotated, and thus not statically checked. In particular, we mix an URL
represented as a string together with one represented as a record in the same
list. The interpreter rather inserts run-time checks, or <em>contracts</em>, such
that if <code>makeURL</code> is misused then the program fails with an
appropriate error.</p>
<p>Gradual types also lets us keep the type system simple: even in
statically typed code if you want to write a component that the type
checker doesn’t know how to verify, you don’t have to type-check that
part.</p>
<h3>Contracts</h3>
<p>Complementary to the static type system, Nickel offers <em>contracts</em>. Contracts
offer precise and accurate dynamic type error reporting, even in the
presence of function types. Contracts are used internally by
Nickel’s interpreter to insert guards at the boundary between typed and untyped
chunks. Contracts are available to the programmer as well, to give them the
ability to enforce type assertions at run-time in a simple way.</p>
<p>One pleasant consequence of this design is that the exposure of the user to the
type system can be progressive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users writing configurations can just write Nix-like code while ignoring
(almost) everything about typing, since you can seamlessly call a typed
function from untyped code.</li>
<li>Users writing consumers or verifiers of these configurations would use
contracts to model data schemas.</li>
<li>Users writing libraries would instead use the static type
system.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of contract is given in the next section.</p>
<h2>Schemas</h2>
<p>While the basic computational blocks are functions, the basic data blocks in
Nickel are records (or objects in JSON). Nickel supports writing self-documenting
record schemas, such as:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>{
  host | type: Str
       | description: "The host name of the server."
       | default: "fallback.myserver.net"
  ;

  port | type: Num
       | description: "The port of the connection."
       | default: 4242
  ;

  url | type: Url
      | description: "The host name of the server."
  ;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Each field can contain metadata, such as a description or default
value. These aim at being displayed in documentation, or queried by
tools.</p>
<p>The schema can then be used as a contract. Imagine that a function has
swapped two values in its output and returns:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>{
  host = "myproject.com",
  port = "myproto://myproject.com:1/",
  url = 1
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Without types, this is hard to catch. Surely, an error will eventually pop up
downstream in the pipeline, but how and when? Using the schema above
will make sure that, whenever the fields are actually evaluated, the
function will be blamed in the type error.</p>
<p>Schemas are actually part of a bigger story involving merging records
together, which, in particular, lets the schema instantiate missing
fields with their default values. It is very much inspired by the
<a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-configuration-syntax">NixOs module system</a> and the <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a> language, but
it is a story for another time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope that I gave you a sense of what Nickel is trying to achieve. I
only presented its most salient aspects: its gradual type system with
contracts, and built-in record schemas. But there is more to explore!
The language is not ready to be used in real world applications yet, but a good
share of the design presented here is implemented. If you are curious about it,

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

Gevers heeft screenshots genomen op het moment dat hij toegang had tot Trumps account. Die screenshots zijn door&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/twitter-trump-opnieuw-gehackt/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>&nbsp;gedeeld met <i>de Volkskrant</i>. Nederlandse beveiligingsexperts noemen de claim van Gevers geloofwaardig.</p><p data-element-id="c946-23c2-841c-0f31-6f16-4be9-bd21-35ca">De Nederlander heeft Trump en de Amerikaanse overheidsdiensten gewaarschuwd voor het beveiligingslek. Na een aantal dagen kreeg hij contact met de Amerikaanse Secret Service in Nederland. Die dienst is ook verantwoordelijk voor de beveiliging van de Amerikaanse president en nam de melding serieus, blijkt uit correspondentie die door <i>de Volkskrant</i> is ingezien. Inmiddels is het account van Trump beter beveiligd.</p><p data-element-id="6496-bdf0-d56a-cf50-9bf7-40a4-d268-cbcf">Het is niet de eerste keer dat Nederlandse hackers erin slagen om het Twitteraccount van Donald Trump over te nemen. Dat gebeurde vier jaar geleden, vlak voor de Amerikaanse verkiezingen, ook al. Toen slaagden drie hackers erin om gezamenlijk het wachtwoord te achterhalen en het account van Trump binnen te komen.</p><h3 data-element-id="a6ff-4061-9533-0d2f-b697-ac37-45ef-012c">Doelwit</h3><p data-element-id="2a3a-646c-50a6-762d-1c67-05e1-8fc7-2def">Dat dit opnieuw is gelukt, is opmerkelijk. Tijdens de Amerikaanse presidentsverkiezingen in 2016 hebben Russische hackers op grote schaal gepoogd de uitkomst te beïnvloeden. Daarna hebben sociale media diverse stappen gezet om manipulatie te voorkomen. En ook nu, amper drie weken voor nieuwe verkiezingen, pogen Rusland en Iran volgens Amerikaanse inlichtingendiensten om de verkiezingen digitaal te manipuleren. Het ligt voor de hand dat ook het Twitteraccount van de president een doelwit is.</p><p data-element-id="64ad-18a2-d97d-ee7b-42d7-f9fd-bcbd-2d68">Twitter wil tegenover <i>de Volkskrant</i> niet on the record reageren en zegt nooit in te kunnen gaan op de beveiligingsmaatregelen voor individuele accounts. Donderdagavond laat het bedrijf wel aan verschillende Amerikaanse media weten ‘geen bewijs te hebben gezien om de bewering te staven’.&nbsp;</p><p data-element-id="a4ab-88b8-7677-4a70-7b7b-0073-03a6-eb0c">Ronald Prins, oprichter van beveiligingsbedrijf Hunt &amp; Hackett en één van de bekendste Nederlandse experts op dat gebied: ‘Ik ken Victor Gevers al heel wat jaren. Hij staat erom bekend dat hij zijn leven wijdt aan het vinden van kwetsbaarheden en hij gaat daar altijd heel ethisch mee om. Op basis van wat ik weet en heb gezien, ziet zijn claim er geloofwaardig uit.’</p><p data-element-id="63a7-8e83-1b74-233c-0244-af6a-a943-d44c">Victor Gevers was in 2016 ook een van de drie hackers die inlogden op het account van Trump. ‘Dat het zo snel weer zou lukken, was niet gepland’, vertelt hij over de aanloop naar de actie. Aanleiding om opnieuw te pogen het account van Trump te hacken, was de berichtgeving in de Verenigde Staten over Hunter Biden. De harde schijf van de zoon van de Democratisch presidentskandidaat Joe Biden zou gestolen of gehackt zijn – mede doordat Hunter Biden een makkelijk te raden wachtwoord gebruikte (Hunter02).</p><p data-element-id="04b3-538f-5657-c7a2-b9c5-22a3-7749-4151">Gevers is bekend met gelekte databases vol oude wachtwoorden en zoekt daarin naar de gegevens van Hunter Biden. Hij meende na analyse van de oude databases dat de informatie onjuist was. Hunter Biden gebruikte andere wachtwoorden. Gevers: ‘Ik kon zien dat het zijn wachtwoord niet was.’</p><figure data-element-id="dab196b3-e132-4a0e-b936-26e9bc538a59"><picture><source srcset="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/rhXaFgOzmfomigBBY4Ba2lXgfN8/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9&amp;desiredformat=webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/bQxDCojNnHEqCx-Uo3r7MzGS5tY/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9" type="image/jpeg"> <img data-height="1602" data-original="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/bQxDCojNnHEqCx-Uo3r7MzGS5tY/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9" data-src="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/bQxDCojNnHEqCx-Uo3r7MzGS5tY/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9" data-title="Victor Gevers te gast bij Op1 nadat het nieuws over de succesvolle vorige hack van Trumps Twitteraccount bekend werd." data-width="2880"></picture><figcaption><cite>Victor Gevers te gast bij Op1 nadat het nieuws over de succesvolle vorige hack van Trumps Twitteraccount bekend werd.</cite><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3 data-element-id="ab86-641f-a1d1-7998-e99f-35e6-06eb-c30b">‘Steekproefjes’</h3><p data-element-id="ed8b-e1ec-7d69-1b90-2cf8-b9af-91a3-1b9c">Het brengt hem op het idee om te controleren hoe goed de beveiliging van geverifieerde accounts op twitter eigenlijk is. Hij kijkt naar het account van Susan Rice, de voormalig Amerikaanse veiligheidsadviseur, naar dat van Joe Biden en andere prominente politici. En dan toch ook nog even naar Donald Trump. ‘Steekproefjes doen, dat is mijn werk. Kijken of er ergens een lek in de beveiliging zit.’</p><p data-element-id="809e-1dbe-5995-70f7-ff1a-c483-3ef5-2cec">Eerder ontdekte Gevers een gigantische Chinese database met de locatiegegevens van 2,7 miljoen inwoners van Xinjiang – China’s grootste provincie, waar veel Oeigoeren wonen. In de slecht beveiligde database stonden allerlei persoonlijke data: ID-nummers, nationaliteiten, telefoonnummers, geboortedata, foto’s, werkgevers, maar ook de GPS-coördinaten van de plaatsen die deze mensen bezochten. Door de vondst van de database werd nog eens duidelijk hoe nauwgezet China de Oeigoerse minderheid in het land volgt.</p><p data-element-id="dc0d-9b27-47ba-5e32-f9e6-de4b-818b-ec6a">Op vrijdagochtend 16 oktober voert Gevers haast achteloos een aantal wachtwoorden en variaties daarop in. Bij de vijfde poging is het raak. Hij probeert ‘maga2020!’ (de afkorting van MakeAmericaGreatAgain, de slogan van Trump) en zit pardoes in het Twitteraccount van de Amerikaanse president. Hij is stomverbaasd. Gevers: ‘Ik had gedacht dat ik na vier mislukte pogingen een block zou krijgen. Of dat ik om extra informatie gevraagd zou worden.’ Niets van dat alles.</p><p data-element-id="a238-61a8-1665-18ee-901c-85ea-915f-6b96">Gevers zit die ochtend in misschien wel het belangrijkste Twitteraccount ter wereld en kan 87 miljoen volgers, de aandachtige wereldpers en regeringsleiders een boodschap sturen.  ‘Ik dacht wel: daar gaan we weer’, zegt Gevers. Want zomaar inbreken op een account is strafbaar.</p><h3 data-element-id="875d-d9b4-33bf-0aeb-f685-a37b-2824-c4db">Vriendelijk advies</h3><p data-element-id="b16a-ac7d-9b93-e891-92e3-e13a-a3b4-a039">Als Gevers duidelijk wil maken dat hij met goede bedoelingen handelt, zal hij verantwoord moeten zijn en zijn stappen moeten documenteren. Hij maakt screenshots. Hij schrijft vervolgens een mail aan Donald Trump – ‘ik had nog een oud mailaccount van hem dat we gebruikten voor de melding in 2016’ – en stuurt ook een kopie naar de Amerikaanse organisatie voor digitale veiligheid.</p><p data-element-id="34c3-16de-37ad-5291-d241-ab5b-a5bf-9293">Hij adviseert Trump vriendelijk om extra beveiligingsmaatregelen te nemen. En om misschien een wat langer wachtwoord te nemen. Gevers doet er zelfs een suggestie bij: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, en een handleiding hoe hij tweestapsverificatie aan kan zetten. ‘Maar ik kreeg geen reactie.’</p><p data-element-id="3fe3-0c7c-36a9-2f69-d275-82c8-5832-297c">Dus probeert hij anderen te waarschuwen. Het campagneteam van Trump, zijn familie. Hij stuurt berichten via Twitter en vraagt of iemand Trump erop wil attenderen dat z’n Twitteraccount onveilig is. Hij tagt de CIA, het Witte Huis, de FBI, Twitter zelf. Geen reactie. Gevers: ‘Op zaterdag zag ik wel opeens dat tweestapsverificatie op het account was ingeschakeld.’</p><p data-element-id="da68-6024-d91e-4421-db8f-881d-4f46-902b">Twee dagen later krijgt hij ’s avonds een mail van de Amerikaanse Secret Service. ‘Vriendelijk. Ze waren geïnteresseerd in mijn informatie. Ik heb ze alles doorgestuurd.’ Op dinsdag spreken ze elkaar digitaal. Ze bedanken Gevers en vertellen hem dat het beveiligingslek bij hen onbekend was.</p><h3 data-element-id="07ca-60ee-aaaf-c968-21c3-7027-640c-4ef1">Stomverbaasd</h3><p data-element-id="6df8-2542-1e2c-d7ce-ab6f-bced-f75d-1b28">De beveiligingsonderzoeker blijft met een aantal vragen zitten. ‘Waarom is het mogelijk voor iemand uit een andere tijdszone om in te loggen op zo’n belangrijk account? Waarom eist Twitter niet een beter wachtwoord? Als ik in zijn account kan komen, kunnen vreemde mogendheden dat toch ook? Waarom krijgen de personen die de president dienen te beschermen de melding niet dat zijn account lek is?’</p><p data-element-id="c38e-2913-55ce-eec2-99da-1982-9dd7-7a69">Ook Matthijs Koot, beveiligingsonderzoeker bij Secura, is stomverbaasd dat het Gevers lukte om zo makkelijk het account van Trump over te nemen. ‘Streng verwoord: wie anno 2020 basale adviezen voor onlineveiligheid in de wind slaat, vormt een potentieel gevaar voor zichzelf en z’n omgeving.’&nbsp;</p><p data-element-id="940c-4473-108a-b1f3-1c85-fa0a-17d8-5b8d">Koot vindt dat de risico’s ook anderen treffen. ‘We zijn tegenwoordig steeds meer onderling verbonden, waardoor een inbraak op het account van één persoon of computer óók de privacy en veiligheid van anderen kan ondermijnen. Via Trumps account kun je immers ook zien welke privéberichten aan hem zijn gestuurd, of dat zijn contacten anderen doorverwijzen naar een link met malware of een vervalste inlogpagina die ze vertrouwen omdat die afkomstig lijkt van Trump.’</p><p data-element-id="e56e-e4a5-7439-46c3-af26-2a7a-5b66-2c23">Dat roept de vraag op in hoeverre Twitter verantwoordelijk is voor extra beveiligingsmaatregelen. Koot: ‘Dwing ofwel af dat mensen aanvullende authenticatie gebruiken of, als ze dat echt niet willen, een complex wachtwoord nemen. Want de tijd van inloggen met alleen een zwak wachtwoord is voorbij.’ Twitter wil niet op vragen reageren.</p><p data-element-id="b9c6-7cb5-8a7b-e17f-9d53-ddad-226c-8520"><span>Blijft de vraag waarom Trump zo’n zwak en simpel wachtwoord gebruikte. Gevers heeft een mogelijke verklaring: ‘Trump is boven de 70 – oudere mensen zetten vaker tweestapsverificatie uit, omdat ze het ingewikkeld vinden. Dat geldt bijvoorbeeld ook voor mijn moeder. Voor een nieuwere generatie is digitale veiligheid vanzelfsprekender.’</span></p><article-element-consent-aware article-element-id="f3bf5e92-6a25-4ab9-864e-fca678649ab1__d012e0b4-3482-48c1-82d3-896bcdc23126"></article-element-consent-aware><template data-element-id="f3bf5e92-6a25-4ab9-864e-fca678649ab1__d012e0b4-3482-48c1-82d3-896bcdc23126"><div class="artstyle__element--freehtml"> <style>

            <p>    Het Twitteraccount @realDonaldTrump van de Amerikaanse president Donald Trump is gehackt door een Nederlander. Trump gebruikte het wachtwoord 'maga2020!' (make america great again) en zou geen extra beveiliging hebben ingesteld.

                    <p>De Nederlander is ethischÂ&nbsp;hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/0xDUDE">Victor Gevers</a>, die al vele duizendenÂ&nbsp;datalekken en andere kwetsbaarheden op het internet heeft gemeld. Het kostte hem zeven pogingen om het wachtwoord van de Amerikaanse president te raden, zo stelt hij tegenÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/twitter-trump-opnieuw-gehackt/">Vrij Nederland</a>.</p>
<p>"Ik dacht 'oh god' toen ik was ingelogd", vertelt GeversÂ&nbsp;tegen RTL Nieuws. "Ik wil juist dat het me niet lukt om binnen te komen, en al helemaal niet bij zo'n belangrijk account."</p>

                    <h2>Account gehackt</h2>
<p>Het bewijs dat Gevers toegang had tot het Twitter-account van Trump is ingezien door RTL Nieuws en Vrij Nederland. Trump had volgens Gevers ook geen extra beveiliging ingesteld, zoals de code die je soms na het inloggen moet invoeren - ook wel <a href="https://help.twitter.com/nl/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication">tweestapsverificatie</a> genoemd.</p>
<p>Gevers heeft niet namens Trump getweet of zijn privÃ©berichten ingezien, maar had beide wel kunnen doen. Als ethisch hacker waarschuwt hij personen of organisaties op kwetsbaarheden in de hoop die te verhelpen. Gevers is binnen de Nederlandse hackerwereld bekend en geliefd om zijn ethische werkwijze.</p>

                    <div>
                    <h2>'Immense gevolgen'</h2>
<p>Correspondent Erik Mouthaan zegt dat Trumps Twitteraccount zijn belangrijkste communicatiemiddel is. "Het Witte Huis heeft gezegd dat alle tweets gelden als officiÃ«le verklaringen van de president. Op ministeries wordt hetÂ&nbsp;account scherp in de gaten gehouden, want vaak moet er beleid gemaakt worden op basis van Trumps gedachten. Zo kondigde hij via Twitter een verbod op transgenders in het leger aan, in plaats van een persbericht of een wetsvoorstel."</p>
<p>"Twitter is de plek waar Trump zijn woede en trots ventileert, je krijgt echt mee hoe hij zich van moment tot moment voelt. Als een kwaadwillende partij vlak voor de verkiezingen het account zou kapen, kan dat immense gevolgen hebben voor de integriteit van de verkiezingenÂ&nbsp;en de veiligheid van het land."</p>

            </div>

        <div>
                    <div>
                    <h2>Secret Service</h2>
<p>Mogelijk had Trump geen tweestapsverificatie omdat zijn campagneteam ook toegang moet hebbenÂ&nbsp;tot zijn Twitteraccount. Zo'n extra beveiliging maakt het lastiger om een account te delen met anderen. Gevers heeft via-via contact gekregen met deÂ&nbsp;United States Secret Service en het lek gemeld.</p>
<p>Het is niet de eerste keer dat Gevers toegang had tot het Twitteraccount van Trump. In 2016 lukte het hem om samen met twee vrienden toegang te krijgen. Toen was het wachtwoord 'yourefired', dat Gevers samen met zijn twee hackervrienden vond tussen de gelekte LinkedIn-wachtwoorden.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter is om een reactie gevraagd, maar heeft niet gereageerd.</p>

                    <h2>Advies</h2>
<p>Trump heeft inmiddels zijn wachtwoord aangepast en tweestapsverificatie ingeschakeld. Dat juicht Gevers toe: "Alsjeblieft mensen, schakel tweestapsverificatie in", zegt hij. "Zelfs als je een slecht wachtwoord gebruikt, zoals 'maga2020!', dan nog blijf je beschermd tegen dit soort simpele aanvallen."</p>

<p>Chow Po-chung<strong>’</strong>s sixth Weibo account was killed on August 11, one day after he posted a photo of Hong Kong’s Lion Rock with the caption: “Hong Kong, my home.”</p>



<p>Chow, a political philosophy professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, had anticipated this. A few weeks earlier, China had enacted a broad and vaguely worded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html">national security law</a> in Hong Kong, which criminalizes pro-independence sentiments, and anything else that authorities interpret as “splittist” or damaging to China’s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lion Rock, a mountain overlooking central Hong Kong, has become a symbol of the city’s pro-democracy movement. Within hours of Chow’s post, the comment section beneath it was flooded with nationalistic comments and personal attacks. He estimated hundreds of users reported him to Weibo for “trying to divide China,” and his account was deleted.</p>



<p>Nearly 550 million people — <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-04/28/c_1125915967.htm">more than 60% of China’s internet</a> users — have an account on Weibo, a microblogging platform owned by the Beijing-based Sina Corporation. Since its launch in 2009, the platform evolved into a rare space for public discussion in China, crucial for disseminating information, shaping political discussion, and generating grassroots campaigns, until heavy censorship kicked in two years later.</p>



<p>Chow opened his first account in 2011. He shared the joy of becoming a new father, photos with students, his teaching notes, his essays, and his experience partaking in social movements. He also facilitated and participated in ideological and philosophical debates with young Weibo users. He amassed 180,000 followers before being censored in June 2018. Five of his accounts have since been deleted, some due to posts about the protests, others for no obvious reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I considered every message I posted as my last one,” Chow says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Weibo has always censored accounts, as Chinese authorities have stepped up their crackdown on freedom of speech and tightened their grip over all aspects of Chinese life in recent years, political discussions on the platform have become even more muted. Due to pervasive censorship and self-censorship, conversations on Weibo are even more cautious. <em>Zhahao</em>, or “account bombing,” where accounts voicing dissenting opinions get censored, have become more common. Ultranationalistic and chauvinist narratives now drown out critical posts, making it harder for users to speak their minds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Chinese authorities give social media platforms general guidance about what topics and users to monitor or censor, leaving Weibo to decide which keywords and accounts to block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if regulators have their eyes on a specific message or account, they still need the service provider to actually delete the content, according to Fu King-wa, a journalism professor at The University of Hong Kong. State censorship began to intensify in 2011, when social media debates on controversial environmental, social, and cultural issues started to spill over to offline grassroots protests and campaigns, Fu says. This included dozens of ordinary people challenging China’s election system by campaigning as independent candidates on Weibo, and users addressing the controversy around the Red Cross Society of China, which erupted after a young senior official at the government-run charity posted photos on Weibo of her lavish lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fu says it’s not clear if censorship has stepped up again in recent years, as he doesn’t have figures to compare early censorship to what’s happening now, but he suggests that years of censorship have intimidated users into silence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/">Weiboscope</a> tracker, which Fu runs at Hong Kong University, nearly 2% of 54,490 random user accounts tracked in 2015 no longer existed by 2020. Fu believes most of the lost accounts were deleted by Weibo. This is a rough estimate, as some accounts may have been reactivated since they were deleted, or deleted by users.</p>



<p>“By the end of 2019, the discussion on Weibo was really dominated by discourse and narratives created by state media,” Fu says. “Finding alternative discussion on issues like the Hong Kong protest was very difficult, unless you followed the less popular accounts.”</p>

<p>A more alarming trend, Fu says, is that nationalistic users are now mobilizing hundreds or thousands of people to report on people with political views they oppose and thus pressure Weibo to “kill” their accounts. According to Chow, this tactic is reminiscent of Cultural Revolution–style purging of political rivals. When enough people report on the same account, there is little doubt that censors will delete it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shutting down accounts intimidates users into self-censorship. Weibo still serves as a critical venue for public discussion: 2020 has brought an increasing usage of the site, Fu notes, because more Chinese took to Weibo to voice their grievances, frustration, and discontent amid the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan. But when users fear they will lose their accounts, they no longer speak as freely.</p>



<p>Weibo users who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> all noticed a trend of increasing censorship over the past few years. Accounts have been removed after mentioning politically sensitive topics, such as the protests in Hong Kong, China’s human rights violations against Uighurs in Xinjiang, Covid-19, and top political leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she became active on Weibo in early 2018, Lao Yang, whose nickname is roughly translated as “Old Yang,” fiercely advocated for gender equality and human rights to her 50,000 followers. “I enjoyed just shifting the conversation a little bit more toward the uncomfortable. I enjoyed being the asshole in the room,” Yang says.</p>



<p>Her account was deleted last summer after she signaled support for the Hong Kong protests. When she started a new account, a self-proclaimed Weibo staff member reached out and advised her to lay low for a while as she’d already popped onto the radar of the Cyberspace Administration, China’s central internet censor. They told her that whenever she posted sensitive words, primarily in relation to Hong Kong, authorities at the Cyberspace Administration received an algorithmic notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As long as you keep your account,” reads a message from the Weibo worker that was reviewed by <em>Rest of World</em>, “you can keep your advocacy going.”</p>



<p>Yang followed the advice. She went back to advocacy after a few months, but her account was finally “bombed” on New Year’s Day. Whenever she tries to start a new one, it is deleted within 24 hours. And mainland Weibo users can face severe consequences beyond censorship. If their real identity is revealed, nationalist Weibo users may report them to their employers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, China instituted a <a href="http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2013/0910/c87228-22871736.html">law</a> stating that, if one user’s post is considered defamatory and is viewed 5,000 times or reposted more than 500 times, the original poster can face a jail sentence.</p>



<p>Zhahao<em> </em>attacks can also be very disturbing for their victims. “The first bombing dealt a big blow to me,” Chow says. “This was an attack on your life, your memory, your social network, and your identity as a whole.”</p>

<p>Weibo has <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com//2017-09/14/c_1121665443.htm">required</a> real-name verification upon registration since 2017, linking accounts to people’s official ID or phone number. But users who have been kicked off have been able to get back on using burner accounts from underground online shops.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how such shops set up bot accounts — none of those contacted would talk with a journalist. The cost of a burner account ranges from 0.5 yuan (7 cents) to 240 yuan ($35). The account sellers operate in a legal gray zone, catering mainly to accounts looking to boost their profiles. Authorities have been cracking down on such shops in recent years. In 2018, China’s central internet regulator <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_2645705">launched a campaign</a> to remove users who obtained burner accounts after being banned on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Wu Xianwei turned to buying burners after her first two accounts were removed. Wu, who grew up in Shanghai but is a Canadian citizen, recently completed her Ph.D. in communications at the University of Iowa. Her first account was censored in March 2018, after China scrapped presidential term limits, allowing current president Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely. Wu reposted a statement that read: “I disagree.” The following day, all the accounts that she knew reposted it had disappeared.</p>



<p>Her spare account, also listed under a pseudonym, was active for only two months until she shared a satirical picture mocking Xi and Kim Jong Un.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wu bought 20 burner accounts for 10 yuan ($1.50) in 2018 and went through every single one of them within a year. Since then, getting ahold of burners has become more difficult. When Wu went back to the same shop for more last year, she found that it no longer existed. Many others have also shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Wu says, about 100 of her Weibo friends also lost their accounts. Most of them were highly educated liberals, and they formed a WeChat group to stay in touch. That group, too, has been deleted and re-created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Wu has been galvanized by the experience. She keeps reappearing on Weibo just to “piss off” ultranationalistic users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Living overseas, Wu is protected from the worst of the consequences of zhahao. For those based in China, or with family in the country, the stakes are much higher than just losing their accounts. One of Wu’s friends was summoned to a police station after posting an image of the cartoon character Winnie the Pooh, which is commonly used to mock Xi Jinping due to a perceived likeness between the two.</p>



<p>Some censored Weibo users have switched platforms. Chow and Yang have both moved onto Twitter, but there, their impact and audience are smaller. Around 10,000 of Chow’s followers have come with him to the U.S. platform, which is blocked in China. He says that he’s not given …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Customer retention is a goal every business owner should be obsessed with. At the end of the day it's cheaper to retain an existing customer than it is to acquire a new one.</p><p>But how do you ensure that your customers keep using your service?</p><p>Are there any simple, yet effective ways to reduce or even prevent churn?</p><p>As it turns out there's one simple strategy you can use to keep your customers around even if they're about to leave your platform. Let's explore what it is and why it works.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-obsess-over-customer-retention">Why you should obsess over customer retention</h2><p>As already stated in the introduction it's important to focus on customer retention when building a sustainable business.</p><p>Acquiring customers can be an expensive endeavour. If you're not (yet) in a position where your product grows through Word-of-Mouth you're likely spending a good portion of your revenue on paid ads and marketing to drive traffic to your service. Only a few of your thousands of visitors will eventually try your product and convert to become a paying customer.</p><p>Optimizing this marketing and sales funnel is a tricky and costly activity. Think about it for a minute. Who finances your learnings and tweakings of such funnel? Correct, <strong>your existing customers</strong>.</p><p>That's why keeping your users happy and around is one of the most important business objectives.</p><h2 id="why-customers-are-churning">Why customers are churning</h2><p>If you think about it, there's really only one reason why your customers are leaving your platform:</p><blockquote>Your product isn't a crucial part of their life anymore</blockquote><p>While this sounds harsh I'd like you to think about all the services you're currently subscribing to. Now imagine that you can only keep one. What would you cancel? Probably everything except the one you can't live without.</p><p>Of course, the preferences are different from person to person and they change over time. And that's the exact reason why people cancel their subscription with your service: Their preferences have changed and they might want to take a pause from your service or need something else entirely.</p><h2 id="churn-baby-churn">"Churn Baby Churn"</h2><p>Now that we know why your customers churn, it's time to get into their shoes and think about ways to keep them around.</p><p>One of the "industry" standards is to send out a survey once they're about to leave to gather feedback and convince them to stay. Some services offer coupon codes if for example the user has clicked on the "it's too expensive" option in the survey.</p><p>Other tactics are more on the "dark patterns" side of things. Hiding buttons, asking double negative questions or using other techniques to make it nearly impossible to leave. Needless to say that customers of businesses practicing such tactics aren't the ones who spread the word on how awesome the product is. Quite the opposite.</p><p>But let's take a step back for a minute and ask ourselves why this "should I stay or should I go" question has to be binary in the first place. Isn't there something "right in the middle"? Something where a user can stay but somehow go at the same time?</p><h2 id="wait-a-minute-or-a-month-">"Wait a minute... or a month..."</h2><p>The solution to this dilemma is dead simple and obvious, yet rarely used: Make it possible to <strong>pause the subscription</strong>.</p><p>Yes, it's that simple. Just offer a way to pause a subscription and get back to it once your users current circumstances have changed.</p><p>Now you might think that it's a really bad idea to let users pause their subscription. They'll pause and never come back. So essentially it's a "passive churn" as they haven't left the platform yet but might never use it again. The stale user data is sitting in the database and your dashboards are still showing hockey-stick growth. Furthermore it's a huge implementation effort as pausing and resuming subscriptions isn't something considered business critical and hence wasn't implemented just yet.</p><p>Those are all valid concerns and some of them might turn out to be true even if you have a "pause- and resume your subscription" system in place. But let's take a seconds to look at the other side of the equation.</p><h2 id="why-pausing-is-a-good-idea">Why pausing is a good idea</h2><p>They very first thing that comes to mind is the COVID-19 pandemic we're currently in. A lot of business scaled back and hence had to cancel subscriptions to their favorite SaaS tools to cut costs. A common "save the customer tactic" used here was to get in touch with the business owner and offer heavy discounted year long subscription plans. That way businesses could reassess if they should really quit and leave the huge discount on the table or just go with it and double down to benefit from the sweet, discounted multi-year subscription deal.</p><p>Letting business put their subscription on hold would be another strategy that could be used to help retain and eventually reactivate your users during this pandemic. Put yourself into your customers shoes again for a minute. Wouldn't you want to pay it back in the future if your supplier lent you a helping hand and wasn't "forcing" you out the door?</p><p>Even if your customers pause their account you still have their E-Mail address to reach out to them and keep them informed about your product. In fact you should use this opportunity to stay in touch, ask them how they're doing and providing something of value along the way. That way you keep the communication "warm" and your business stays on "their radar". There's a higher likelihood that they think about your service when times have changed and they're about to scale things up again.</p><p>Having a way to pause a subscription is an action that's usually taken with some level of consideration. If your customer wants to quit (s)he'll just cancel the subscription anyway. Offering a way to pause for the time-being is another option your users might just not have right now, so they're forced to make a very binary decision and therefore they just quit.</p><p>What you should also think about is that pausing a subscription doesn't necessarily mean that you'll lose revenue for sure. There are different and very creative ways in which you can implement the pause. My gym for example simply extends my membership for the amount of months I put my membership on hold. In the summer I make use of this feature since I do my workouts outside anyways. However those 3-4 months I "save" are simply "added" to my contract. I just have a little bit more control about how and where I spend my time with sports. You can get really creative here and invent other ways for this mechanism to work if you really want to ensure that you don't lose revenue.</p><p>A last, important point is that you can use this functionality as a competitive advantage and "marketing material". Be sure to add the fact that people can pause their subscription to your list of product benefits. Add it to the copy right next to your "Subscribe Now" button. Addressing objections and concerns right before the call-to-action is about to happen will drastically increase your conversion rates.</p><h2 id="things-to-keep-in-mind-when-going-down-that-path">Things to keep in mind when going down that path</h2><p>Now you might be excited and eager to implement this strategy in the near future but before you do so I'd like to call out a couple of things you should keep in mind when implementing it.</p><p>First of all: <strong>Keep it simple</strong>. There's no need to jump right into code and implement this functionality end-to-end. Do it manually in the beginning. Update the database records and the subscription plans for people who want to pause their subscription by hand. Maybe you find out that very few people want to make use of this feature. What you definitely want to put in place is your new copywriting. As discussed above you should ensure that your marketing website is updated and reflects the recent change you just introduced.</p><p>Next up you want to have an <strong>automated follow-up E-Mail sequence</strong> / Drip campaign setup for pausing customers. Keep in touch. Ask for problems they had with your software and help them succeed in whatever they're up to right now. You might want to jump on a quick call to gather some feedback as to why they paused and understand what needs to be in place for them to come back. If you do this, please ensure that you're <strong>genuinely interested</strong> in the communication. There's nothing worse for a user than composing a reply and shooting the E-Mail into the marketing void.</p><p>A very important, yet often overlooked step is to have a tool in place which deals with "passive churn". Such a system ensures that the credit cards on file are up to date and chargeable. There could be an overlap between your users pausing their subscription and their credit cards expiring. You don't want to make them look bad because of that. You could even think about a "concierge service" which onboards them in person once they'll come back. Combine this with a quick update on all the new features / updates they missed and are not yet familiar with.</p><p>Lastly you absolutely don't want to make it hard for your users to pause their subscription. As mentioned above, avoid dark patterns at all costs. And more importantly: <strong>Don't penalize them for pausing</strong>. Messages such as "We'll retain your data for the next 60 days" are inappropriate in the day and age of "Big Data" and access to Petabytes of storage for a nickel and dime.</p><h2 id="your-challenge">Your challenge</h2><p>I'd like to challenge you to think about adding the possibility to pause a subscription. Is it suitable for your business? Would it help you retain and reactive more customers (especially in the current situation we're in)?</p><p>If you're about to add it, keep in mind that it doesn't have to be complicated. Start with a simple E-Mail form your users can fill out to let you know for how long they want to pause. Just make sure that you follow the best practices outlined above and that you advertise that it's now possible for your customers to pause their subscriptions.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Customer retention is one of the most important metrics every business owner should focus on. It's the existing customers who finance the Customer Acquisition Costs that are necessary to bring new users into the door.</p><p>It's almost always cheaper to keep your existing …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Apple launched four new iPhones including the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Out of all the four new releases, only two will be available in India for now- the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. Soon after the new iPhones were announced, Apple discontinued the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone Pro Max. The company also reduced the prices of its existing iPhones including the iPhone 11, iPhone XR, and iPhone SE.</p><p>The Apple iPhone 12 is priced starts at Rs 69,900 for the base variant whereas the iPhone 12 Pro costs Rs 1,19,900 for the base variant. Well, that is not something unexpected. Considering the previous trends, the iPhone Pro models are released with an exorbitant price tag. Now to add to the woes of people looking to buy the iPhone 12 Pro, they should know that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro is more expensive in India than in any other country. Dubai for instance sells the iPhone 12 Pro for Rs 84,000.</p><p>Now this rings a bell. The iPhone 12 Pro is comparatively cheaper in Dubai. So cheap that you can actually go to Dubai, buy the phone and come back. Let us explain the math to you for a better understanding.</p><p><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Price in India for 128 GB:</strong> Rs 1,19,000</p><p><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Price in Dubai for 128GB: </strong>Rs 84,000. It costs Dh 4,199 in Dubai and if you convert the currency to INR, the price comes down to almost Rs 84,000.</p><p>So, should this mean that you can go to Dubai, buy the phone and then come back? Well, if you ask me. It is not that bad an idea. The 12 Pro will go on sale from November 6. So you book a flight for Dubai from Delhi or Kolkata for November 6 or later than that, you can get the return ticket for a little over Rs 18,000.</p><p>Below is the exact amount, you would be spending on your flight tickets to Dubai from New Delhi. However, the amount might change depending on the availability but this is what we found when tried booking a ticket to Dubai.</p><p><em>Flight ticket: Indigo Rs 17929 approx<br>iPhone 12 Pro 128GB: 84,000<br>Some other expenses: Around Rs 10,000<br>Total: Around Rs 1,11,929<br>Money saved: Around Rs 8000</em></p><div> <p><img data-src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/bodyeditor/202010/Screenshot_2020-10-21_at_12.19-1200x742.png?EZDB1F4V_MBUFqe1VNjueddsHKGJgQ7S" src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/bodyeditor/202010/Screenshot_2020-10-21_at_12.19-1200x742.png?EZDB1F4V_MBUFqe1VNjueddsHKGJgQ7S" alt=""></p></div><p>Now, considering that the world is battling coronavirus pandemic and the virus is in no mood to slow down, we do not encourage anyone to travel. The whole idea was to not send you to Dubai but to draw your attention towards Apple’s exorbitant pricing in India. It is no secret that the taxes and duties that are applied to imported phones are highest in India. The taxes are so high that for an important iPhone that you will end up paying an average tax of Rs 24,000 for something like an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Mini.</p><p>However, despite the sky-rocketing prices, iPhone still sells best in India and the buyers give whatever price Apple asks them to pay.

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rotate-video-featured-image-final.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="rotate a video using ffmpeg" title="rotate-video-featured-image-final" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rotate-video-featured-image-final.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">
</figure>


<p>Sometimes when a video is captured wrong due to bad technique or simply bad luck, its useful to have a simple way to rotate it either clockwise or anti-clockwise. </p>



<p>Lucky for us, FFmpeg <a aria-label="has a filter  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#transpose-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has a filter</a> to rotate a video by specifying the direction. It takes a video as the input and a set of commands that you can use to instruct FFmpeg on how to rotate the video, and then FFmpeg will take care of the rest. </p>




<h2><span id="How_to_Rotate_a_Video_90%C2%B0_With_FFmpeg"></span>How to Rotate a Video 90° With FFmpeg?<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the command line for rotating a video using FFmpeg’s <code>transpose</code> filter. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 -vf "transpose=dir=1" rotatedVideo.mp4</code></code></pre>



<p>You are using the <code>transpose</code> filter using <code>-vf</code> in FFmpeg. This takes a set of parameters to control the direction of the transpose/flip/rotate operation and to prevent the transpose from taking place. </p>



<p>Let’s learn more about this. </p>



<p>Here are the options that are available in FFmpeg to rotate a video. You can either mention a number from 0 – 4 or the words <code>cclock_flip</code>, <code>clock</code>, <code>cclock</code>, or <code>clock_flip</code>.</p>



<pre><code><code>0/cclock_flip = 90 degrees CounterCLockwise and Vertical Flip (default)</code><br><code>1/clock = 90 degrees</code> <code>Clockwise</code><br><code>2/clock = 90 <code>degrees</code> CounterClockwise</code><br><code>3/clock_flip = 90 <code>degrees</code></code> <code>Clockwise and Vertical Flip</code></code></pre>



<h2><span id="How_to_Rotate_a_Video_180%C2%B0_With_FFmpeg"></span>How to Rotate a Video 180° With FFmpeg?<span></span></h2>



<p>Let’s look at this use case now. How do you rotate a video 180° using the transpose command?</p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 -vf "transpose=dir=2:transpose=dir=2" rotatedVideo.mp4</code></code></pre>



<p> I used the ParkJoy sequence and flipped it 180 using this command. You can see the result for yourself in the video below. So basically, you are instructing FFmpeg to rotate the video 90 degrees counter-clockwise two times which totals up to 180 degrees.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470871248" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<h2><span id="How_to_Prevent_Rotation_for_Landscape_or_Portrait_Modes"></span>How to Prevent Rotation for Landscape or Portrait Modes?<span></span></h2>



<p>A typical use case for this is for post-processing videos captured from your mobile phone – some are probably in portrait mode and some are in landscape mode. </p>



<p>Now, if you use FFmpeg to process them as a batch, you probably want a way to tell FFmpeg to <strong>not rotate videos</strong> that are either in landscape or portrait mode. </p>



<p>Thankfully, there is an option for that as well in FFmpeg’s <code>transpose</code> filter.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i parkjoy.mp4 -vf "transpose=dir=2:passthrough=landscape" parkjoy-90-flip.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The above commandline says that FFmpeg should transpose the video 90 degrees CounterClockwise ONLY if the video is NOT landscape mode. </p>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion <span></span></h2>



<p>I hope you understood how to rotate a video using FFmpeg. If you liked this, please let us know in the comments section, share the post with your friends, and <a href="https://ottverse.com/category/ffmpeg/">check out the rest of our FFmpeg tutorials.</a></p>

I purchased one as soon as I could afford it at a shop called Dixons close to where I lived in rural England. Since that first enthusiastic purchase, I’ve collected a few other player/recorders over the years and a healthy collection of discs.</p><p>Back in the day, using Sony’s SonicStage software to manage my collection was a pain. It was slow at the get go, and became increasingly choppy as tracks grew into the thousands. Rights management restrictions, imposed to stop folks from pirating perfect digital copies, were a nuisance. Yet, I loved that first MiniDisc player and the amazing little discs that slotted into it.</p><p>Two and a half decades later, I’ve added a few more MiniDisc devices and a lot more discs in my collection. My favorite is the Sony MZ-RH1, the last MiniDisc player/recorder Sony ever produced. It is sleek and sexy, sounds amazing, can record 34 hours of music onto a single disc, and is as much a work of art as a piece of electromechanical and electro-optical engineering can achieve. </p><p>Unfortunately, Sony doesn’t make the lithium ion batteries for this masterpiece anymore, and the one I have, which arrived with it packed in the box, no longer accepts a charge. A quick search on eBay brings up a few new “old stock” batteries to buy, but folks want $150+. </p><p>I needed a solution that didn’t induce sticker-shock…</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2><em>It’s time to start loving Ikea’s infamous instruction manuals</em></h2><p>The mindset of how most people first approach technical documentation, including myself, is perfectly summed up into a piece of popular wisdom, saying:</p><blockquote>Ain’t nobody got time for that!</blockquote><p>Totally explainable. Up to a point.</p><p>Technical documentation seems to take perfectly functional lines of code and break them down into boring, useless explanations.</p><p>Plus, if you are the developer who wrote the code, it’s only natural to think you will make sense of what your very own logic produced. And if you’re not, then you probably can find out by ringing that guy at any time of the working days, and even on the weekends. Let’s face it, you’re close enough. You’re one of the few team members of a tech company so small that it doesn’t have a technical writer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f9013020b20144e22e79a62_employee%20of%20the%20month.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>But maybe that’s just the problem.</p><p>What your growth strategy lacks is a more user-oriented approach.</p><p>Technical manuals and documentation tell us more than how to use an app or any other product. They are the number one tool reflecting how much of your energy goes into UX design. And UX design shows how much importance your users hold. Which should be a lot.</p><p>So do you want to generate more traction for your business?</p><p>Then maybe a ReadMe is what you need.</p><p>If it sounds far-fetched, then let’s take a look at one of the most popular companies that produce hardware and break down their technical process into a step-by-step technical guide. And that is Ikea. OK, maybe that’s not a regular hardware manufacturer, but it’s close enough. And there certainly is a solid, worldwide fanbase the company has.</p><p>One of the reasons why is the usability of their products.</p><p>The best thing about Ikea is also the worst: their very detailed, almost never-ending instruction manuals. As soon as you open an Ikea manual, putting together the pieces of a chair seems like rocket science. That’s because they take their documentation very seriously. But it’s only when trying to switch to other brands that you realize how useful those stacks of explicit instructions really are.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f90137cb2ae71321fefa4e9_come%20back%20to%20me%2C%20buddy.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you want to achieve the same attachment to your products, follow for your documentation the same set of 3 easy principles that Ikea applies in their manuals.</p><h3>1. <strong>Focus on your user</strong></h3><p>A lot of companies make the error of getting the engineers or product designers to write the documentation for themselves. But actually, they know their products too well. So, they don’t find it necessary. They always delay until the very end, don’t put much time into making it and leave out many important aspects.</p><p>Don’t worry, this is a frequent mistake.</p><p>Fix it easily by switching from a developer perspective to a user perspective. They might look alike but differ greatly.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f901494084f42a8f94ed23a_user%20perspective%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2. <strong>See the bigger picture</strong></h3><p>You need the consumer, or the end user, to understand how they relate to the technology you offer. And as soon as they do so, they’re hooked.</p><p>Good documentation increases customer loyalty and ensures that they will buy your other products in the future. It can also be a great selling tool for prospective customers because it gives them a clear idea of how they might use your product, and what they could achieve with it.</p><p>So get out of your box. Zoom out. Don’t disregard your customer’s emotions. In the end you’ll have to adopt a broader view anyway, and if it takes you too long, the sight won’t be a delight.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f90158c1f4c0a261b5e145b_friends%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>3. <strong>Never too many details</strong></h3><p>Quality user information is the most cost-effective way of answering the questions that your customers will encounter when using your product; otherwise they’ll call you for the answer, a far more expensive solution.</p><p>Let’s go back to Ikea. How could they deal with offering support to every customer who doesn't know which screw goes where? They couldn’t. And it’s more than understandable why they wouldn’t.</p><p>Good documentation is an essential part of the complete package, not an afterthought or last-minute addition. Put aside time to create it all along the development of the product.</p><p>You designed your product with high design values and attention to detail – now apply the same standards to your documentation.</p><h2><strong>There’s more to documentation than your user</strong></h2><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f9015f41a48015bc198092c_more%20than%20user%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>I know what you’re thinking: it seems like my ramble amounted to nothing.</p><p>That is not what I’m saying. The 3 principles built around your customer will prove to be very useful as a sales technique for your product and as a business growth tool.</p><p>What I’m saying is, it gets better.</p><p>Good documentation also works as an internal tool, both after it’s completed and in the process of creating it. Putting information together will help bring everyone in your team on the same page.</p><p>Moreover, it boosts the flexibility of your work environment, allowing employees to work hours that differ from the normal company start and stop time. That’s because everybody knows everything about everything, since all knowledge is centralized in the same place.</p><p>At <a href="https://archbee.io/">Archbee</a>, we always hear from our customers that our documentation software has the most impact on the quality of collaboration inside teams. Empowering people to work real-time on the same documents really gives them the feeling of being part of a community, as well as a sense of security. Everybody knows where to go for accountable data. Documentation is always reliable and works as a community aggregator.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Whatever product or system you’re writing documentation for, people reading it go through a mental journey of learning, understanding and applying that documentation. Be it your users or your own team, use the information that’s already in your company to help you scale up to the next level.</p><p>At the end of the day, internal documentation isn’t just about providing instruction manuals for your company’s products or services; it’s a means of communication. While it may feel like it’s an incredibly time-consuming, boring piece of paperwork that nobody is going to read, it’s actually something that is essential to keeping any business running smoothly. When it’s available, thorough, and well written, people will read what is necessary to know how todo their jobs correctly. And if you want your organization to run as smoothly as possible, that’s a good place to start.</p><p>Plus, the next time somebody asks you why you’re putting up with this tedious process of writing technical documentation, you have the chance to ask them in return, ”When is the last time you googled for Ikea instructions?”</p><p>That should do it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f90168e736a7b8acf40b966_bring%20it%20on%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></div><div><div><h3>Read more information about team work, documentation and knowledge management.<br></h3><div><p>And use everything in your work with distributed and remote teams,<br>to be more effective and organized.</p></div><div><div><p>Thank you!

All of these press releases and news articles speak of ‘bold’ action to ‘drive sustainability’ for farmers and consumers. These are noble causes and I don’t deny most people in these companies seriously believe they will be apart of the solution. Like many other industries, agriculture must try and improve some environmentally unfriendly practices in order to follow through a broad sense call-to-arms from society at large. Also, like many other industries, agriculture figure out ways to do this and retain (or rethink) profitability and economic model <em>along with</em> the added difficultly of providing reliable and safe food sources for that same society. We could have sustainable farming within a few years time, but we would also see food prices soar to riot inducing levels.</p>



<p>The elephant in the room with these agriculture companies that are so eager to adapt more environmentally friendly practices is their business model depends on annual row crops being planted on ever growing acreage and supplemented with the latest and great biotechnology traits, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticide, seed treatments, etc. One <em>possible</em> part of bringing agriculture to a more sustainable state involves <em>decreasing</em> acreage of crops like maize, soybean, wheat, and cotton. This is why I will always maintain that current multinational agriculture input will not solve (or even improve) sustainability issues associated with modern agriculture. They are simply aligning themselves with public-friendly talking points that gives them some good public relations. In a capitalistic sense, these companies thrive when crop production is increasing. There revenue streams do not match their press releases. This is analogous to the automobile industry giants [Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota] that were never going to solve the electric vehicle problem because it was <em>bad for business</em>; these companies only started truly paying attention when it appeared Tesla would start eating into their profits and market share. A funny thing about Tesla: it owes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html" target="_blank">large piece of its success</a> due to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early" target="_blank">United States government</a>. No commercial bank was willingly to give Tesla money to do what he wanted–except for the US government because it recognizes subsidizing behavior it deems desirable is a path to get high-risk, high reward ideas off the ground.</p>



<p>This is exactly why I continue to advocate on this blog that the USDA needs to be a strong voice and possible financial backer in the sustainability push agriculture is entering. Right now, the USDA is incentivizing production of maize, soybean, wheat, cotton at all costs via several direct and indirect subsidy programs. There are no downsides risks and some of the consequences include farming marginal ground. A farmer simply has to get the ground in production and there are virtually no risks to losing money. Along the way, these multinational agriculture companies get their cut by selling the seed, fertilizer, chemicals to grow that crop. There is subsidy money already in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/09/18/usda-provide-additional-direct-assistance-farmers-and-ranchers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/09/18/usda-provide-additional-direct-assistance-farmers-and-ranchers" target="_blank">budget</a> and delivering it to the people efficiently has been solved (which is an important aspect as the government oftentimes struggles to reach its indented audience effectively). The path to more sustainable farming starts with the USDA. Perhaps the end results is a Tesla-like startup that utilizes a startup loan from the USDA to figure out the incentives of sustainability.</p>



<p>A more sustainable agriculture sector has to reconcile several aspects, some of them directly competing with each other. Most of the maize we grow in the United States ends up used in ethanol for vehicles or used as animal feed. One well-known problem (despite <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/usda-energy-efficiency-of-corn-ethanol-production-has-improved-significantl" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/usda-energy-efficiency-of-corn-ethanol-production-has-improved-significantl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent improvement</a>) is that maize isn’t the best crop species to make <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph240/dikeou1/docs/net_energy_balance2009.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph240/dikeou1/docs/net_energy_balance2009.pdf" target="_blank">ethanol</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/charts/83915/cornuse.jpg?v=88.1" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>As electric vehicles take gasoline powered vehicle off the roads, the demand for ethanol should naturally vanish along with the demand for that corn. This will happen, and it will have negative consequence unless these maize acres have another profitable outlet. Simply planting a different crop and flooding those markets will decimate those industry as well. The scale of agriculture is simply too big. We cannot start planting 150M acres of maize or soy rotated ground with cover crops, expect to allow cattle to graze that cover crop, and make the whole system profitable. We have to start pricing land more asymmetrically for its carbon sequestration potential. For some reason this is an unpopular concept in these newly minted carbon markets where 1 ton of sequester carbon is worth ~$15 USD no matter where that acre is located. Conversely, if you want to buy land to farm you might pay <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ispfmra.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Land-Values-Report-e-version.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ispfmra.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Land-Values-Report-e-version.pdf" target="_blank">$15,000 USD an acre</a> for prime farm ground in Illinois or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extension.sdstate.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/P-00117.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://extension.sdstate.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/P-00117.pdf" target="_blank">$1500 USD an acre</a> for not so prime farm ground in South Dakota. That is an order of magnitude difference and is a true reflection of the demand for that asset.</p>



<p>Right now in agriculture we simply do not have a true market. The startups in this space seem to think $5-$15 an acre is fair value for its carbon capturing potential. It doesn’t matter if that land is adjacent to an important river or stream that provides water to communities or is in the middle of nowhere. Land that is the most at risk for erosion or has leeching properties that make it poor candidates for applying synthetic chemicals (that are used by most all non-organic operations) needs to be properly priced. Agriculture <em>is</em> already hyper efficient but it can become moreso by concentrating production of crops where we get the most crop per acre. Someone (Silicon Valley or someone with a big bank) can make this market happen–its going to take fortitude or foresight, but agriculture does not lack those minds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What can a pipe wrench teach us about software engineering?
A lot, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>.</p>
<p>An electrical engineer and professor at MIT, Bush was "one of the most politically powerful inventors in America since Benjamin Franklin," as his biographer <a href="https://geni.us/liVH8">G. Pascal Zachary puts it</a>.
During WWII, he personified the United State's military research, organized the Manhattan Project, and played a crucial role in the Allied victory.
He was also a mentor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, the father of the information age.</p>
<p>One anecdote of Bush's career as an instructor at MIT particularly inspired me: his pipe wrench lecture.</p>
<p>Bush would greet an auditorium filled with aspiring engineers, hold up a pipe wrench, and challenge them: "Describe this".</p>
<p><img src="https://mokacoding.s3.amazonaws.com/2020-10-21-pipe-wrench.jpg" width="70%" alt="image of a pipe wrench"></p>
<p><i>Not the actual pipe wrench showed by Bush, I found this one on Amazon.</i></p>

<p>One by one, they would try, and each time Bush would dissect the description, pointing out where it was vague.</p>
<p>Finally, he would write in precise English a patent application for the wrench:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By turning the nut to the right or left the movable jaw may be moved either toward or away from the fixed jaw, as may be desirable.
The inner face of the movable jaw is formed at a right angle to its shank, and is also provided with a series of teeth, which pitch or rake on its fellow jaw...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this exercise, Bush drilled into the class the value of precision.</p>
<h2 id="precision">Precision</h2>
<p>"Given the pipe wrench, produce the words for that wrench and no other; given the words, produce the wrench.
That, Bush taught his students, was the beginning of engineering", write Soni and Goodman in <a href="https://geni.us/FqRN7P"><em>A Mind at Play</em></a>.</p>
<p>Bush MIT students were electrical engineers, but precision is something software engineers should learn, too.</p>
<p>Precision is fundamental when representing building a model for the domain of the software in code.</p>
<p>One way in which a domain representation can be vague is when it allows inconsistent state to occur.
If you work in a language with a strong type system, like Swift, you can use precise types to make your domain modeling clearer and make undesirable state unrepresentable.</p>
<p>For example, when modeling an operation that can either succeed with some data or fail with an error, you could use a type like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>Operation</span> </span>{
  <span>let</span> success: <span>Bool</span>
  <span>let</span> data: <span>Data?</span>
  <span>let</span> error: <span>Error?</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>This type does the job but leaves room for errors: nothing stops you from creating an instance with <code>success</code> true but <code>data</code> nil or one with values in both <code>data</code> and <code>error</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> inconsistentOperation = <span>Operation</span>(success: <span>false</span>, data: someData, error: .<span>none</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result"><code>Result</code> <code>enum</code></a>, you can remove this ambiguity <em>at compile time</em>, making it impossible for both data and error to be set simultaneously.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>Operation</span> </span>{
  <span>let</span> result: <span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Data</span>, <span>Error</span>&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another useful <code>enum</code>, borrowed from the <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm programming language</a>, is <a href="https://github.com/mokagio/RemoteData"><code>RemoteData</code></a>: a way to encapsulate the state of a network operation.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>enum</span> <span>RemoteData</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; </span>{
  <span>case</span> notAsked
  <span>case</span> loading
  <span>case</span> loaded(<span>T</span>)
  <span>case</span> failed(<span>Error</span>)
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>enum</code>s are not the only way tool to make your domain modeling more precise.
<a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-nonempty"><code>NonEmpty</code></a> uses <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Generics.html#ID186">type constrained generics</a> to represent <code>Collection</code>s that are not empty.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> xs = <span>NonEmpty</span>&lt;[<span>Int</span>]&gt;(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>)
xs.first + <span>1</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>NonEmpty</code> adds clarity to the values you define, possibly avoiding runtime crashes by making it impossible to access via subscript an empty array.</p>
<p>If you had to represent "a collection of unique positive integers where order matters and with at least one element," you could use <code>[Int]</code>, or you could combine <code>NonEmpty</code>, <a href="https://github.com/Weebly/OrderedSet"><code>OrderedSet</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/uint"><code>UInt</code></a> in <code>NonEmpty&lt;OrderedSet&lt;UInt&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>[Int]</code> might be simpler but leaves the door open for all sorts of inconsistent instances, like an empty array, an array with negative values, or one with more than one occurrences of the same value.
<code>NonEmpty&lt;OrderedSet&lt;UInt&gt;&gt;</code> requires more work but using it will make the compiler help you avoid inconsistent state.</p>
<hr>
<p>We like to call ourselves software <em>engineers</em>, but sometimes forget that engineering is an applied science.
It is rigorous and methodical.
When building a bridge, an integrated circuit, or a motor, precision matters.
If the parts don't fit, if the power supply is not adequate, if there isn't enough material, things won't work.</p>
<p>With software, we're blessed with having a more malleable medium than our colleagues working in the physical realm.
That shouldn't be an excuse to forget the value of precision.</p>
<p>What are your favorite ways to use the type-system to implement a precise domain model?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>One thing that has really benefited my productivity (and also my general sanity), has been learning
how to take a big task and break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Big tasks can be
frightening and overwhelming, but if I just keep working on the list of smaller tasks, then somehow,
as if by magic, the big task gets completed.</p>



<h2 id="adding-value">Adding value</h2>

<p>When programming, I take a very specific approach to this breakdown. I make sure that each step is
something that <em>compiles, runs, passes</em> all the tests<em>,</em> and <em>adds value</em> to the codebase<em>.</em> Exactly
what “adds value” means is purposefully left vague, but it can be things like adding a small
feature, fixing a bug, or taking a step towards refactoring the code into better shape (i.e.,
reducing <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikqYmb_6DsAhXSpZ4KHYm9BhgQFjAHegQIBxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTechnical_debt&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ZJ1dsWoB5Jn1hXvtLGuSZ">technical
debt</a>).</p>

<p>An example of <em>not</em> adding value is adding a new feature, but also introducing ten new bugs. It’s
not clear that the value of the feature outweighs the cost of the bugs, so it might be a net loss.</p>

<p>Another example of not adding value is making the UI prettier, but also make the app run ten times
slower. Again, it’s not clear that the prettier look is worth the performance hit, so it might be a
net loss.</p>

<p>Of course, I can’t always be sure that I’m not introducing bugs, and “value” is inherently
subjective (how much performance is a new feature worth). The important part is the <em>intention</em>. My
<em>intention</em> is to always add value with every single commit.</p>

<p>Basically, what I want to avoid is the “It has to get worse before it gets better”-attitude. Also
known as: “The new system is the modern way to do it. Sure, it has some bugs and runs kind of slow
right now, but once we’ve fixed that, it’s going to be way better than what we had before.” I’ve
seen too many cases where these supposed fixes never happen and the new system, which was supposed
to be better, just made things worse.</p>

<p>Plus, you know, it feels good to add value. If every day I can make a commit and that commit makes
the engine better in some way, that makes me happy.</p>

<h2 id="pushing-to-master">Pushing to master</h2>

<p>In addition to implementing changes through a series of small commits, I also <em>push every one of
those small commits back to the master branch.</em></p>

<p>Note that this is the exact opposite of a <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">feature
branch</a> workflow, instead, it is a form of
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development">trunk-based</a>
development:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a feature branch workflow developers work on new features in isolated, separate branches of the
code and don’t merge them back to master until they’re “complete”: fully working, debugged,
documented, code reviewed, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>In the trunk-based approach, features are implemented as a series of small individual commits to
the master branch itself. Care must be taken so that everything works even when the features are
only “partially implemented”:</p></li>
</ul>


<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/step__trunk-based-development.png">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Trunk-based vs feature branch development.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Proponents of the feature branch approach claim that it is a safer way to work since changes to the
feature branch don’t disrupt the master and cause bugs. Personally, I think this safety is illusory.
Bugs in the feature branch just get hidden until it’s merged back to master when we suddenly get
<em>all</em> the bugs.</p>

<p>Feature branches also go against my philosophy that every commit should add value. The whole idea
behind a feature branch is: “we’re going to break a bunch of shit over here, but don’t worry, we’ll
fix it before we merge back to master”. Better not to break stuff in the first place.</p>

<p>Here are some other advantages I see with the trunk-based approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fewer merge conflicts.</strong> With long-running feature branches, the code in the branch drifts
further and further away from the code in master, causing more and more merge conflicts. Dealing
with these is a lot of busy work for programmers and it also risks introducing bugs. Some of these
bugs won’t be seen until the branch is merged.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Less release-day chaos.</strong> Typically, all features scheduled for a certain release have the same
deadline. This leads to all feature branches being merged just before the deadline. This means
that we get all the merge and integration bugs at the same time, just before the release date.
Getting a lot of bugs at the same time is a lot worse than having them spread out evenly. And
getting them just before a release is due is the absolute worst time to get them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>No worry about the right time to merge.</strong> Since everybody knows that merging a feature branch
tends to cause instability, this leads to worry about the “right time” to merge. You want to avoid
merging right before a release (unless the feature is required for the release) to avoid
introducing bugs in the release. So maybe just after the release has been made? But what if we
need a hotfix for the release? While the merge is being held, valuable programmer time is being
wasted.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>No rush to merge.</strong> When working with feature branches, I often felt a hurriedness about getting
the branches merged. Sometimes because a branch was needed for a specific release. But also often
because the developer was tired of dealing with merge conflicts, wanted to get it over with, and
move on to the next thing. Thus, the goal of only merging feature branches when they are
“complete” was often compromised. (And of course, nothing is ever really “complete”.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Easier to revert.</strong> If major issues are discovered after the merge of a feature branch (which
often happens), there is often a lot of reluctance to revert the merge. Another big feature branch
might already have been merged on top of it (since lots of feature branches often get merged at
the same time, just before a release), and reverting it would cause total merge chaos. So instead
of doing a calm, sensible rollback, the team has to scramble desperately to fix the issues before
the release. With trunk-based development, any major issues would most likely have already been
discovered. The final commit that makes the new feature “go live” is typically a simple one-line
change that is painless to revert.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Partial work is shared.</strong> In trunk-based development, the partial work done on a feature is seen
by all developers (in the master branch). Thus, everybody has a good idea of where the engine is
going. Bugs, design flaws, and other issues can be discovered early. And it is easier for others
to adapt their code to work with the new feature. It’s also easier to get an estimate of how much
work is needed to complete a feature when everybody can see how far it has progressed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Easier to pause and pick up later.</strong> Sometimes, work on a feature might have to be paused for a
variety of reasons. There might be more critical issues that need to be addressed. Or the main
developer of the feature might get sick, or have vacation coming up. This is a problem for feature
branches because they tend to “rot” over time, as the code base drifts further and further away,
causing more and more merge conflicts with the branch. Code that is checked into master does not
“rot” in the same way.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Easier to address other bugs/refactors at the same time.</strong> When working on a feature or a
problem, it is pretty common to find other, related problems, exposed by the work you are doing.
In the trunk-based approach, this is not an issue. You would just make one or more separate
commits to the trunk to fix those issues. With the feature branch approach, it is more tricky. I
guess the <em>right</em> thing to do would be to branch off a new separate bug fix branch from master,
fix the issue in that branch, merge <em>that</em> branch into the branch you are currently working on,
and (once it passes code review) into master (so that other people get the bug fix before your
feature branch is merged, because who knows when that will happen). But who has time for all that
shit? So instead, people just fix the problem in their feature branch, and maybe cherry-pick it
into master if they’re having a good day. So now, instead of being about a single isolated
feature, the feature branch becomes a tangled mix of different features, bug fixes, and refactors.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main challenge of the trunk-based approach is how to break a big task down into individual
pieces. Especially, with the requirement that each piece should compile, run, add value, and be
ready to be pushed into master. How can we push partial work without exposing users to half-baked,
not yet fully working features?</p>

<p>Let’s look at some problems and how to solve them.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-new-features">Problem #1: New features</h2>

<p>An approach that works well for new features is to use a flag to control whether a feature is
visible to end-users or not.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example. A feature that I recently added to the engine was a <em>Download</em> tab that
lets the users download new engine versions and sample projects from within the engine itself:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/step__download-tab.png">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Download tab.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>There are lots of different ways this could be broken down into smaller steps. Here’s an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the <em>Download</em> tab to the menus and show a new blank tab when it’s opened.</li>
<li>Show a (hard-coded) list of things to download (without working download buttons).</li>
<li>Download the list of files from a server instead of having it hard-coded.</li>
<li>Implement the <code>[Get]</code> button by synchronously downloading the file when it’s clicked.</li>
<li>Switch to asynchronous, background downloading.</li>
<li>Show a progress bar for the download.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, I don’t do a full breakdown like this upfront. Instead, I just kind of figure out the next
logical step as I go along. I only sit down and do a serious planning session if the task is
particularly tricky and incremental steps like this don’t come naturally.</p>

<p>To prevent end-users from seeing the tab before it’s actually working, I hide it behind a flag. This
can be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>const bool download_tab_enabled = false;

// ...

if (download_tab_enabled) {
    add_menu_item(tabs, "Download", open_download_tab);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To get the menu option to show the <em>Download</em> tab, you have to change the <code>download_tab_enabled</code>
flag to <code>true</code> and recompile.</p>

<p>We call these flags <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle"><em>feature flags</em></a> since they
selectively enable or disable …</p></section></div>

					<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for the post, I felt heard!<br>
I am a bilingual translator. I am not active on Fiverr, but I have just had a similarly awful experience with Peopleperhour. It wasn’t the first nasty experience with their customer-non-service and bullies/clients.</p>
<p>I am amazed by the shortsightedness and greed of the site hosts. What makes these platforms successful are the sellers, not the buyers. Honest, hardworking sellers who provide quality work and services are penalized, vetted with vengeance, but sellers measures are lax and sloppy.</p>
<p>I am stumped by negative reviews on all the freelance platforms. It makes you wonder where you can get fair work as a freelancer. Where to go next?</p>

					<p>I can add that the same seller/buyer disparity exists on eBay too. I’ve been an eBay member for 17 years and my experience of the site as a buyer was overwhelmingly positive, so I didn’t think twice about selling a couple of items on there just before Christmas. HUGE MISTAKE. Despite two of my buyers being clearly in the wrong *one with written evidence saying that the items broke in their possession* eBay still found in their favour and even charged me for the cost of them returning items to me. It cost me £20 and I was left with a broken item that I obviously couldn’t then resell (plus the email stating that it worked when they received it – kicker). </p>
<p>As a seller it was almost impossible to get hold of eBay …</p></div></article></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></div>

        <div>

  

  <article>
    <p>One of my services was running into timeouts, because connections were being reset by clients. 
I had assumed that it couldn’t be the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html">Network Load Balancers (NLBs)</a> fault, a battle-tested piece in the cloud stack.
The following is about NLBs, cross-zone-loadbalancing and multiple NLBs pointing to the same set of EC2 instances and how that revealed unexpected behaviour in the NLB.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: If you don’t want timeouts or connection resets, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>don’t use cross-zone loadbalancing</li>
  <li>don’t have multiple NLBs pointing at the same targets</li>
  <li>don’t use a public IPv4 address and an NLB for the same target</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-symptom-timeouts">The symptom: Timeouts</h2>

<p>My system was doing lots of requests to two NLBs over the internet.
Unfortunately in quite some cases there were timeouts in the application code.
The timeouts were quite aggressive at 1 second. Since a normal packet loss during connecting usually takes 3 seconds before a retry on linux, 
I initially explained it away as naturally occurring packet loss. 
But the number of failures grew ever higher with the link not even close to being saturated and other calls to external targets being fine.</p>

<p>When I finally got myself to take tcpdumps of the traffic, something strange emerged: TCP RST packets.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup-simplified">The Setup (simplified)</h2>

<p>The configuration in which these issues actually surfaced had multiple machines behind a NAT, talking to multiple EC2 instances behind two NLBs with cross-zone-loadbalancing enabled.</p>

<p>But that’s the messy reality, let’s keep it simple for this article. In the following let’s have 1 client, 1 NLB and 1 EC2 instance, because the issue would still be the same.
The NLB has cross-zone loadbalancing enabled.
<img src="https://www.niels-ole.com/assets/2020/nlb-basic.png" alt="An example of IPs used in the requests to an NLB"></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In TCP, connections are identified by the quadruple of source ip, source port, target ip and target port.
When you create a new TCP connection, it is made sure that no other connection with the same quadruple is in use.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>(Fast forward a couple of days of staring at tcpdump and head-scratching) 
Here is an excerpt of tcpdump as the client sees it, with all the noise removed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Format clientip:clientport &lt;-&gt; targetip:targetport (so a bit different than it looks in wireshark) 
... This connection has been established for some time
90.63.58.20:36230 &lt;- 34.242.162.234:443 Seq=1234 Ack=5432   [ACK]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>EC2 instance (private IP) says through the NLB (34.242.162.234) to the client (90.63.58.20): <em>Hey, I just received your data, all is good.
This connection is healthy and sending data. Everything as expected.</em> 
Now our client wants to make a new connection and sends a SYN packet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>90.63.58.20:36230 -&gt; 18.203.64.15:443   Seq=6951            [SYN]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you notice, the source ports are identical, but this is fine, as the target IPs are different.
Next in the 3-way handshake of TCP we would expect a <code>[SYN,ACK]</code> with <code>Ack=6952</code></p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This packet has the same quadruple, but it isn’t our <code>[SYN,ACK]</code>… wait a sec. Where is this coming from? Does this ack belong on the other connection that the client had with <code>34.242.162.234</code>!?
The Ack numbers match, but that can’t be, can it?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.niels-ole.com/assets/2020/whatthehell.gif" alt="I was thinking: &quot;What the hell&quot;"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>90.63.58.20:36230 -&gt; 18.203.64.15:443 Seq=5432              [RST] 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, at least the client is as confused as I am and sends an RST. It just sucks that this means our SYN will never be properly answered.</p>

<p>Is the SYN of the new connection overwriting an existing connection in the NLB’s connection table?</p>

<h2 id="the-cause">The cause</h2>

<p>Since I had so much trust in AWS NLBs I first assumed the issue to lie somewhere (anywhere) else. 
I imagined it could theoretically be a faulty switch or a misconfigured NAT gateway on the client side.
But it turned out to be neither of them. It was actually the AWS NLB mixing up the connections.
How can this happen?</p>

<h3 id="cross-az-loadbalancing">Cross AZ-loadbalancing</h3>

<p>When the traffic goes through the NLBs the target IP address get rewritten to the internal IP address of the EC2 instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.niels-ole.com/assets/2020/nlb-basic.png" alt="An example of IPs used in the requests to an NLB"></p>

<p>Now how would it look from the client if three connections are created in a round-robin fashion?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>90.63.58.20:20536;34.242.162.234:443
90.63.58.20:36895;18.203.64.15:443
90.63.58.20:60356;52.203.250.3:443
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now this looks unproblematic, nice quadruples - no RST packets.
But what happens if we have more and longer-lived connections? Could collisions happen?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
90.63.58.20:36230;34.242.162.234:443 let's call this connection A
...
90.63.58.20:36230;18.203.64.15:443   and this one B
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As I said in the background, the kernel ensures that there are no quadruple collisions.
And this is still the case in this case. The same source port can be reused, as long as the target ip or port are different. 
As the connections go to different IPs of the NLB, this is the case… but only from the view of the client.
In the NLB the addresses are translated to an internal IP.
So on the EC2 instance the quadruples look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
90.63.58.20:36230;10.54.1.1:443 A
...
90.63.58.20:36230;10.54.1.1:443 B
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now this looks problematic. Two TCP connections share the same quadruple.
Thus the NLB cannot distinguish between them and sends the packets on either of them.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-a-bug">Is this a bug?</h2>

<p>An ordinary NAT would handle such collisions just fine. 
When a collision is detected, not only the address is translated but also the port.
This makes it possible to handle the complete port range before collisions occur.
NLBs apparently don’t act like NATs. I couldn’t find this spelled out anywhere, but apparently they always preserve the source port. 
This basically means that whenever a client makes more than <em>one</em> connection to the NLB, collisions may occur.
During my research I found out I am <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/nlb-connection-resets-109720accfc6">not the only one irritated by that</a> and that they opened a support ticket and got the confirmation that this is indeed intended behaviour.</p>

<p>In any case I don’t think anyone would derive this from <em>just</em> the docs and TCP knowledge.
There should at least be a big warning sign in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html">the documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-now">What to do now?</h2>

<p>This issue not only occurs with cross-zone-loadbalancing, but any time two external IPv4-addresses point to the same EC2 instance in AWS.
This includes multiple NLBs pointing at the same target or an instance having both a public IPv4 address and being behind an NLB.</p>

<p>What I take away from this is to never have two NLBs pointed at the same target groups as well as to turn cross-az loadbalancing off for most use-cases.
And never assume that a part of your stack is infallible.</p>

<p>The Ami started life as the AMI ONE C Concept which was a study on new ways to overcome the challenges of designing a small, affordable city car. The two biggest challenges are how to create as much interior space as possible and how to keep the production costs low. Many of the ideas of the concept car have found their way to the Ami production model.</p>

<h2>Cost Saving</h2>
<p>The 'usual' cost-saving recipe when creating affordable city cars is to share a production line with other manufacturers. The drawback is that these manufacturers are selling the same car with slightly different design details. </p>

  </figure>
<p>Citroën took a different approach. Instead of sharing a production line, they have come up with ways to create the simplest production line. This limits the variety of the design but instead of trying to hide that, the Ami highlights these limitations.
The clearest example is the exterior bodywork. As you can see from the video below, the exterior is largely made up of only three different bodywork panels.</p>

</video> 
<p>This gives it its quirky look as from far away the car does not seem to have a clear front or backside. The doors have a similar effect. Because they are identical,  they open in opposite directions from each other. Instead of trying to hide these limitations, Citroën shows them off in ads and commercials, celebrating the quirkiness of the car.</p>

<p>Citroën was also inspired by the father of mass production, the Ford Model T. Like the Model T, the Ami is only available in one color. Personalization is important to many customers though. So Citroën came up with different sticker sets that the customer can use to personalize the car.</p>

<p>This smart design philosophy continues in the interior. For example, the side windows are not electric but hinge outward. Citroën like to point out that this was inspired by the 2CV, the spiritual father of the Ami, turning it into a nostalgic feature instead of a limitation. </p>

<p>A big challenge for car companies today is that customers want more expensive technology to be available in the car. The adoption rate of new smartphones is high and customers expect the same level of innovation in their cars. For a cheap city car, it is impossible to provide this.
That is why the Ami does not have a center console but instead, a big smartphone mount. Like this, the Ami leverages the driver's smartphone to offer the same features as premium cars without the cost. Similarly, the car has no speakers. Instead, there is an opening in the dashboard designed to hold a Bluetooth speaker.</p>

<h2>Interior Space</h2>
<p>Creating a lot of interior space is a huge challenge for small city cars. Thanks to Ami's electric drivetrain, the space that is otherwise used to house the engine, gearbox, and other mechanical parts can now be used for the interior. It also means that the wheels can be placed at the outer edges of the car which not only gives it a tiny turning circle, it also maximizes the interior space. </p>
<p>The many windows of the car allow for a lot of natural light to enter the cabin which helps in making the interior feel big.
Entering the vehicle for the first time feels unreal. The car is much smaller than any other vehicle on the road. With its length of 2.41m and width of 1.29m, it is significantly smaller than a Smart Fortwo (2.69m x 1.66m). But when entering the car, the interior feels so spacious that it seems bigger than the car itself!</p>
<p>Clearly, the Ami is not meant for going on vacation so it does not need to have a big amount of storage space. It does manage to have enough interior space for the things you would bring on short trips.
Due to the packaging of the car, the dashboard reaches quite far to the front of the car. In it, there are different patterns and holders for small items like a water bottle or sunglasses. </p>

<p>An idea that directly comes from concept car is to place the passenger seat a bit further back than the driver's seat which creates a space for a backpack in the passenger's footwell.</p>

<p>Driving the Ami around Paris, it feels more like a scooter than a car. Thanks to the many windows, you feel more exposed and connected to other road users. It is easier to make eye contact and communicate with cyclists and pedestrians so it is a much friendlier vehicle than a regular car.
Despite the cheap materials, the interior is not an unpleasant place to be. By cleverly creating space and a place for the smartphone, it provides everything you might need for a short trip. It is hard not to love it!</p>

<p>Citroën has intended the Ami to be a car for the (urban) masses and is trying to give anyone a reason to use one. It is available to buy for around 6000 euros or rent for 20 euros per month after a down payment. Additionally, several car-sharing services will include the Ami in their fleet. It is not only available at Citroën dealerships, but also in France's big electronics retailers Fnac and Darty. </p>

<p>It has a top speed of 45km/h, it can do 75km on a full charge and it takes only 3 hours to charge it in a normal 220v household plug. It is classified as a quadricycle, not a car, so anyone over 14 can legally drive the car in France without a license. </p>
<p>Citroën did not design the car for a specific target audience. But the company does want to tap into the market of families. Citroën expects that almost half of the drivers will be younger than 18. They argue that parents will prefer to have their teenage children race around the city in a vehicle that is much safer than scooters or bicycles. The price of a monthly subscription is similar to a public transportation card or scooter subscription making it an attractive alternative.
The first signs are clearly positive as there are currently waiting lines to test drive one. </p>

<p>So far so good then. The Ami is cheap, well-designed, eco-friendly, and accessible to most of the public. What is not to love? To understand my concerns, we have to dive back in time and look at the bigger picture of city transportation.</p>
<h2>A History Lesson</h2>
<p>Before cars were the main mode of transport, city streets were a place where children played football, where neighbors would run into each other and stop for a chat. They were a place where people spent time and socialized. But at some point, something changed. Paris was one of the first cities where this happened. Between 1853 and 1870 Baron Haussman transformed much of the medieval city center of Paris into a 'healthy' city. This involved tearing down much of the narrow streets to make place for wide boulevards. </p>

<p>The side effect was that it allowed horse-drawn carriages to go much faster, resulting in louder, more dangerous streets.
Before, pedestrians ruled the streets and other forms of transportation had to adjust to them. After the transformation though, the wide boulevards switched this around. Check this video from 1890 where this is clearly visible:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fo_eZuOTBNc?start=107" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After the Second World War, this became even worse when cars were seen as the future of personal transportation. The modernist movement turned entire city centers into highways and parking lots. Suddenly, city streets were not a social place, they were there to get traffic from A to B as quickly and efficiently as possible. Pedestrians, despite being in the majority, were delegated to narrow sidewalks, jaywalking became an offense, and most of the public space was allocated to driving or parking. </p>

<p>With the rising importance of global climate change and more recently, the Covid crisis, cities are realizing that the current solution is unsustainable.
A country where this realization has happened a few decades ago is the Netherlands. Like other countries in the '60s, Dutch cities were moving towards car-centric infrastructure. There were plans to destroy much of the historic center of Amsterdam to make way for …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="my-first-date-with-rust---know-thy-enemy">My First Date with Rust - Know Thy Enemy</h2>
<p>As a working programmer with several mainstream languages under your belt (eg <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>javascript</code>, <code>python</code>, etc) it's reasonable to expect that after a bit of orientation with quirks and syntax you'll find yourself somewhat productive. If you know Rust you won't be surprised when I say my experience was... humbling. </p>
<p>The last time I felt so dumb was probably more than a decade ago, as a novice programmer teaching myself Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I think that's the point, new paradigms require effort to build a working mental model for. And depending on where you start on the ladder you might have quite a lot of mental rebuilding to do.  </p>
<p>Rust intentionally tries to be "boring". That is to say, its DNA borrows liberally from prior art. If you're familiar with manual memory management (<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Obj-C</code>) you'll probably understand pointers in Rust. If you're familiar with functional languages (<code>Haskell</code>, <code>Elm</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, <code>OCaml</code>) you'll have an immediate start recognising the type system. The reason it aims for boring is because it spends its entire novelty budget on the one unique idea: automatic scope based memory allocation (aka the borrow checker). This is the knockout feature: <strong>the performance of C with the safety of garbage collected languages.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://intorust.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plenty</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">of ink</a> <a href="https://squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has been</a> <a href="https://dev.to/strottos/learn-rust-the-hard-bits-3d26" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">written</a> about ownership and the borrow checker. It follows the most unprecedented feature would have the most said about it. There seems to be a common refrain: "<em>It's really hard at first, but stick with it. You'll see, it changes everything</em>". Sounds suspiciously like Vim or Emacs users (please don't fight me). Is it the promised land or just a severe case of Stockholm syndrome?     </p>
<p>Nevertheless, extensive reading had prepared me to expect a big ol' messy fight with the borrow checker. We did tussle, but it went better than expected. Ironically, after years of <code>C#</code> game development, performance concerns have taught me much of the internal dialogue needed to reason about memory lifetimes: "Is this allocated on the stack or heap? Is this going to create allocation (garbage collection) pressure? Is this copying data or mutating it in place?"</p>
<p>In this sense, when the borrow checker complained I could at least appreciate what it was trying to protect me against. And as to be expected, it may be a while yet before I fully grok lifetimes. Controversially though, "Rust's expressive type system" put up a stiffer fight than I anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="stubbing-toes-on-functional-programming">Stubbing Toes on Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Before anyone grabs a pitchfork, this isn't a rant about the unnecessary burden of type systems. Throughout my career, I've favoured statically and strongly typed programming languages. I believe in correctness, and tooling should help you get there. It's why Rust excites me.</p>
<p>Taken to its ultimate conclusion, one arrives at <code>Haskell</code> and other pure functional programming (FP) languages. FP's conceit is trading performance for correctness. As a concerned game developer, this never felt like a bargain I could entertain. Not that it's prevented FP idioms from seeping into the groundwater of other programming languages (see <code>LINQ</code> in <code>C#</code> or <code>map() filter() reduce()</code> in <code>javascript</code> as examples).   </p>
<p>You can see signs of this functional DNA written all over Rust too, immutability by default being the most obvious. However, Rust strikes a wonderfully pragmatic balance. Imperative programming is not outlawed, and many escape hatches exist. Rust is, as far as I'm aware, <strong>the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions</strong>. If the borrow checker is the obvious hit single, this is the real album sleeper hit. </p>
<p>I think my undoing was simply that I had a false expectation of equivalence. I'm confident in my type literacy and I can, if we must, talk in-depth about Java design patterns. I've never courted a "proper" functional language, but I recognise their influence. I understood "expressive type system" to be a superset of what I already know. In some respects it is, but in others, it was fundamentally different. I want to share some of my "aha" moments because I haven't seen much written with this lens...  </p>
<h2 id="use-rust-analyzer">Use Rust Analyzer!</h2>
<p>To anyone following my footsteps: <strong>setup your dev environment for code intelligence and type hints</strong> is my best advice. I intentionally offer it here before any code samples make you glaze over and miss it.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Rust-Analyser.png" title="Screenshot of Rust Analyser extension in Visual Studio extensions gallery"></p>
<p>At the time of writing (Oct 2020), I found Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension to be the most reliable path. I learnt this only after naively installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Rust</code></a> extension, which provides a front end for both the earlier <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>RLS</code></a> and the more modern <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>. However, in my experience, the native <code>rust-analyzer</code> extension was vastly superior.</p>
<h2 id="taste-testing-rusts-flavour">Taste Testing Rust's Flavour</h2>
<p>If you can express something as a type, the compiler can offer you guarantees about it. An expressive type system allows you to model domains that weren't possible before, often using simpler machinery too. Rust takes this affordance and runs with it. Types are used for everything, and I do mean <strong>everything</strong>. A lot of problems didn't quite make sense until I learnt to recognise them for what they were: type errors. </p>
<p>However, starting out, there are a few obvious differences I'd put into the "quirks" category. They seem foreign and strange, but acclimatisation comes quickly. I'll only briefly touch on them for those who've never seen Rust before. Exhaustive coverage exists in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Rust book</a> and <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-am-a-java-csharp-c-or-cplusplus-dev-time-to-do-some-rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Rust doesn't have <code>classes</code> and only uses <code>structs</code>:</strong>   </p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>  </pre>
<p><em>"Cool cool. Structs are kinda like classes anyway"</em></p>
<p><strong>Methods are defined in <code>impl</code> blocks instead of the <code>struct</code> definition: </strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>

<h2 id="where-the-functional-rubber-meets-the-road">Where the Functional Rubber Meets the Road</h2>
<p>Giant monolithic classes are considered a code smell. A signal that responsibilities need to be separated into separate concerns. Still, OOP maintains the feeling of discrete units. Data and behaviour are contained within the cell walls of the class, or at least within the inheritance chain.   </p>
<p>Rust, by comparison, feels inside out, "itty bitty" and piecemeal. What might have been a single class is instead an accumulation of structs and traits, each defining their own narrow window into data and behaviour. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In this talk</a>, the creator of Clojure, another functional language, describes this quality as "ad-hoc polymorphism". Using only what you need, when you need it. This granular approach maximises the immutable surface area, mutability is limited to where it's necessary.   </p>
<p>In the flame wars of "was OOP a giant mistake?", it's debatable whether <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/object-orientation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust allows you to write OOP code</a>. I understand this now not as a wholesale rejection: abstraction and encapsulation remain necessary tools. However, Rust forces you to leave behind features ardents consider harmful, inheritance being the obvious example. Call it "OOP, the good bits" if you will. </p>
<p>Ideas like composition over inheritance or separating data from behaviour have been around for a long time within the OOP world. However, FP encourages new principles, determinism and the avoidance of side effects. Let's look at an example. </p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake">Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake</h3>
<p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null pointer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his billion-dollar mistake</a>. Any programmer knows the misery of finding an error log littered with <code>Null Reference Exception</code>. But <code>null</code> values are fundamental, like the oxygen we breathe. Whenever I tried to contemplate an alternative I suffered a failure of imagination. <em>"No null values? Far out man."</em> </p>
<p>For a while, in prior languages, I attempted to answer this question by initialising variables with a default value instead of <code>null</code>. That worked when the default value meant something, otherwise, it just piped junk data into the system. Still, in successful cases, I began to appreciate the guarantee  it offered. Any downstream code could trust a variable would be valid and not have to muddy itself with unexpected exceptions.</p>
<p>Software is such that, unfortunately, there will always be cases where initialisation or access of a resource fails. FP provides us with a more complete answer here. It …</p></div></div>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>The mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage wrote 26 programs between 1836 and 1841 for the unfinished "Analytical Engine" (AE). The code is embedded implicitly in tables summarizing program traces. In this talk, I present the programming architecture of Babbage’s mechanical computer based on the first code written for the machine. The AE had a processor separate from memory, and worked using a kind of dataflow approach. The stream of arithmetical operations was independent from the stream of memory addresses. Special "combinatorial" cards allowed the processor to execute FOR and WHILE loops. Combinatorial cards also allowed independent looping through the stream of memory addresses. Quite sophisticated computations were possible and illustrate why Babbage talked about the possibility of doing "algebra" with his machine. The programs I will discuss predate by several years the account published by Menabrea in 1842 and translated later by Lady Lovelace with notes of her own.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In 1991, the famous game "Another World" was published for the Commodore Amiga. It achieved cult status mainly for its visionary art style. But also technically it was quite interesting, as it was based on a game-specific bytecode language executed by a virtual machine interpreter. Eric Chahi, the author of "Another World", six years earlier had written the game "Infernal Runner" on the Amstrad CPC. The game, published by the French company Loriciels, was rated fairly mediocre by the press, was rather simple, and also still had some bugs. Nonetheless, the game is cool from a software architectural point of view. Like "Another World", it is largely not written as a conventional Z80 program, but in a specifically designed bytecode language. This language is interpreted by a virtual machine supporting "parallel" execution of up to 255 tasks by a simple multitasking scheduler. This nice concurrency feature enabled a very elegant design of the various enemies and animated game levels. The talk will cover the essentials of this bytecode language, the virtual machine interpreter, and the process scheduler. Some code examples from the game will be shown, as well as a port of the virtual machine to JavaScript to make the game playable in a web browser. The talk tries to also give you some insights into the reverse engineering process and how much fun this was.</p>

New LiDAR sensor with focus motors!" width="540" height="304" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7UEHryq7zo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DJI has a 3D focus accessory for the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1585352-REG/dji_cp_rn_00000094_01_rs_2_gimbal_stabilizer.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DJI RS 2</a> that allows you to autofocus any manual lens using LiDAR using what is called time of flight technology. The technology has a few limitations like it won’t autofocus beyond 4m (22ft) because there aren’t enough photons bouncing back at that distance and the system has to be calibrated for each lens. The system also won’t work with lenses that do not have a hard stop.</p>
<p>The system is pretty basic at this time and it is dumb zone AF, but this might be improved with time. The follow focus seems to work best between 1m and 4m from testing and the calibration program, which checks two distances during calibration. The gimbal can store profiles for 3 lenses so you do not have to repeat calibration every time. AF is handled completely independently of the camera and the lens is focused via <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1078023-REG/slr_magic_slr_3595m_cine_ii_e_35mm_0_95_ii_m.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gears</a> so it will focus even with the camera off and since it uses LiDAR it will even focus in the dark. DJI also makes an accessory to <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1447215-REG/dji_cp_rn_00000026_01_ronin_s_part_19_focus.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/">add gears to your manual focus lenses</a>.</p>
<p>The 3D focus module isn’t available yet, but it will be in a few weeks for $169 and it requires the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1585352-REG/dji_cp_rn_00000094_01_rs_2_gimbal_stabilizer.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">focus motors and RS2</a>, but not the Ravens Eye wireless transmitter that was used in the video. If you want the setup to track you then you will need the Ravens Eye wireless transmitter. This system also makes older cameras with poor AF relevant again, which is a nice bonus.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO just announced on Twitter that the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package price will go up by $2,000 starting Monday next week. This price hike is going to set the FSD cost at an staggering $10,000.</p>



<p>In the past, Musk has warned that because of the increase in valuation of the FSD software with the passage of time, Tesla owners will have to pay more to enjoy this futuristic technology. </p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319164198241341440" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319164198241341440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/full-self-driving/">Tesla FSD</a> software gains more and more confidence in roaming the city streets, the $10k price tag might seem affordable in the future. And with the advent of Tesla Robotaxis where the car makes money for you in its free time, the cost will be fully justifiable.</p>



<h2>FSD Beta wide-release</h2>



<div>
<div>
<p>During last evening’s Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Elon Musk also said that the wide-release of FSD Beta will start rolling out at the end of this year. Currently, this specific software release is limited to drivers and owners who are deemed ‘safe and responsible’ by Tesla.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> also said that the wide-release of the FSD Beta this year depends on how much safe this update proves itself in the coming weeks and months of testing.</p>
</div>




</div>



<p>In response to some other questions regarding the worldwide release of FSD beta this year, Elon Musk said that it’s a long process to meet all the regulatory approvals and countries like the UK have Right-Hand-Drive cars, that’s also a challenge to meet.</p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319159425995857921" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human).</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319159425995857921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>Musk also agreed to a suggestion that the price change should currently only take effect in the United States. As in Europe and other countries, the Full Self-Driving phenomenon has yet to go through many obstacles that Elon Musk himself described in the above tweet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given the hype and excitement around yesterday’s FSD Beta limited-release and the upcoming price hike in a few days, Tesla will be able to sell a sizable number of Full Self-Driving packages before Monday.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <em>From a code aesthetic perspective, a combination of Hyperscript and CoffeeScript is an excellent way of writing beautiful React code.</em></p>
<p>React code is ugly. I’m not talking about any technical trait of the framework; I’m talking playing aesthetics, how the code looks on my screen, and the feelings it evokes.</p>
<p>Code aesthetics, in this sense, is not something developers are used to caring about. We have more important worries. Aesthetics are subjective, hard to measure and the benefits of chasing it are unclear. It is not often you’ll see a developer raising their hand and the midst of a Stand-up meeting to tell their peers they’re not pleased with how the code looks on their screen. And I’m not sure someone should, but I'm coming from a different perspective.</p>
<p>My considerations about React’s beauty started when working on a side-project. As most coders with coding as their profession and hobbies, the difference between work and leisure is simply defined by the amount of pleasure you take. Of course, we aim our careers at making both undistinguishable, and though sometimes they are, when they’re not, you still want at least your "coding for relaxation" hours to be as pleasant as possible.</p>
<p>Naturally, if, for some reason, React is unpleasant to me, and I want to spend time coding for pleasure, the obvious thing to do is not to use React. And I don’t, most of the time. But code, as we know, has a multifaceted perspective: you have code, the artifact, lines full of symbols you input to the computer, but you also have the result of your code, its output, the real-life implication of the ideas you expressed using a programming language. And I care, and I can derive equal or even greater pleasure from seeing my code interact with the real world.</p>
<p>The consequence is that sometimes, although I might find one programming language, or framework, or tool, unpleasant to see or use, it is the one I need to see my code taking the shape of something real in a reasonable time. Maybe this is due to some tooling, the big community creating things around it, or some other technical trait. Regardless of the reason, my coding-as-a-hobby time is scarce, and although I want it to be enjoyable, I also want to make the best of it, which means using things that do not always comply with my aesthetic standards. This is the case with React.</p>
<p>While reflecting on this topic one day, a question arose: Can I write React code that is aesthetically delightful while still keeping my productivity high? I know there are tremendously valuable answers to this question out there in the way of other programming languages and frameworks. All of those will have varying degrees of the same trade-offs, like how hard it is to learn, how much can I still benefit from the React ecosystem, how is the tooling around it, and so on. And all those trade-offs need to be measured differently depending on the project’s objective.</p>
<p>My answers to this question are more often than not something else that not React. But every once in a while, you compare every trade-off; you look at your project from different perspectives; you try to rethink the features you envisioned and the requirements you had; and still, at the end of the day, React will be your answer. With those cases in mind, I reframed the original question to: "how far can I go to make my React code more pleasing to view while still keeping it React code?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How far can I go to make my React code more pleasing to view while still keeping it React code?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start answering the question, I created a Create React App project with a simple React code as a reference. I wanted it to have at least a bit of real-lifeless but still be simple enough, so it wouldn't get in the way of testing different things. I chose the official React tutorial code, which you can find here: <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010">Tic Tac Toe</a>.</p>
<p>Zooming on the simplest React component on that piece of code, the Square component, we see the following:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Square</span>(<span>props</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> (
    <span><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>className</span>=<span>"square"</span> <span>onClick</span>=<span>{props.onClick}</span>&gt;</span>
      {props.value}
    <span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span></span>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>And this is the point where things get subjective: I find this code unpleasant. Again I’m not talking about the technical attributes of this code. When I say it is ugly, I’m trying to express a set of feelings it evokes in me, which are heavily based on my own experience of the world in general and programming specifically. It is from this perspective that I'll move on to say that the first problem that screams to me is JSX.</p>
<p>A lot has been discussed about JSX since its introduction, but I'll allow myself a quick consideration of it for the sake of elucidating my point. JSX is messy, but it is also a reality. It comes from a natural evolution of front-end technologies, which have since their beginning some form of XML language to define markup. What makes it different is that JSX usually lives inside your javascript code.</p>
<p>Making a rough comparison with spoken languages, JSX is as if the speakers of a particular language started using a whole set of words and expressions from other languages to express themselves. This frequently happens when a specific subject is innate to a given culture, for example. When people outside that culture, speakers of a different language, face that challenge of expressing ideas about that subject, they'll often lack the vocabulary to deal with it, recurring to the language spoken by those who "gave birth" to the topic as a way to solve it. Language purists soon get angry and point out how you could say those things without the need for imported words. But people would still use those words, and some of those words will eventually be incorporated into the official language. JSX was born from the need for Javascript speakers to express UI markup.</p>
<p>Following the language speakers' analogy, a few souls use the language for aesthetic purposes and a means of self-expression. It is generally the case for poets and literary writers. How do they look at foreign language words? Well, they’ll undoubtedly see them differently. Their perspective is analogous to my view here, as it looks at language from its power to express ideas while also considering it aesthetically. From this perspective, the use of JSX is unnecessary: it adds noise and does not contribute to the expression of the ideas it expresses. </p>
<p>All of this is to say my first step towards a more pleasant way of writing React was to get rid of JSX. </p>
<p>The no JSX version of the button component looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> e = React.createElement;
<span><span>function</span> <span>Square</span>(<span>{ onClick, value }</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> e(<span>'button'</span>, { <span>className</span>: <span>'square'</span>, onClick }, value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The uniformity and conciseness of the code make for a substantial aesthetic improvement. And we can go further in the no-JSX road. I’m far from being the first person discussing JSX adoption. And hating it is probably as old as JSX itself. I bet the original team behind it had someone saying at least that it was unnecessary. You’ll find plenty of reading on reasons why JSX is terrible and the benefits of not using it. Gladly, you’ll also find technically sound alternatives to it. A prominent one is Hyperscript, which is recommended by the React team <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">in their docs</a>. It is a simple tool that helps you build hypertext using javascript. Its React version brings a more attractive API then <code>createElement</code> gives us. I decided to try it out together with a tiny library of helpers called <code>hyperscript-helpers</code>, and I found that those tools contribute to the code aesthetic quite nicely:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Square</span>(<span>{ onClick, value }</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> button({ <span>className</span>: <span>'square'</span>, onClick }, value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Replacing JSX is the Pareto principle applied to the beautification of React code. Little effort, excellent result. A move everyone should definitely make if they want prettier React code.</p>
<p>Moving on with exploring ways of prettifying your React code in the framework's realm, I found a dead-end. While there are design patterns and simple conventions I could explore, those require assessing their technical implications on a case-by-case basis, and I was just looking for something more general. So the next step would need to be in the Javascript layer.</p>
<p>JavaScript is an extremely flexible language, a quality well known as its double-edged sword. It is also something that can be explored from an aesthetic perspective. There are many different ways you can write valid code, with significant stylistic differences and a few technical implications. Many tools will help you customize and enforce the stylistic choices you make, and between those, there's one much of my liking: <a target="_blank" href="https://standardjs.com/">StandardJS</a>. StandardJS is a tool for automating applying a collection of sensible coding style choices to your code. Of notable aesthetic implication between those choices is the exclusion of semicolons.</p>
<p>I find semicolons in JS code an unnecessary noise, and I'm happy taking the risks that come from not using them. After I incorporated StandardJS into my reference example, I was left with the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> Square ({ onClick, <span>value</span> }) {
  <span>return</span> button({ className: <span>'square'</span>, onClick }, <span>value</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>Now in terms of javascript code, this was the best I could get. And looking back to what I had done so far, things were looking ok. The changes implemented were straightforward and could easily be integrated into my default side-project React setup. On the other hand, this was still aesthetically far from what I experienced in different languages. I've discussed the case for other languages already, and the point was I wanted to stick with React in a JS world. Unless there would be something that adds some sparkles of elegance to javascript while still being just like javascript, I’d be too far off the boundary I had set.</p>
<p>“Just like javascript.” While trying to stretch my creativity to look for different possibilities, this phrase made me travel back ten years in time. I was learning web development and had just come across Ruby on Rails. At the time, Rails …</p></div></div>

              After 3 months of trying everything I could think of, I give up.
              I don’t think I will ever develop anything for the Google
              ecosystem again. I’m not angry, I’m not doing this out of spite.
              I just don’t think it is worth it to invest any amount of effort
              to build something on a platform that turned out to be so
              unreliable.
            </p>  <h2>Please scroll down to read the latest update.</h2>  <p>
              I started developing my first extension back in 2010, when Apple
              finally decided to implement proper extension support in Safari.
              Exciting times. I spent a weekend writing my first Safari
              Extension, an ad blocker called “Cleaner Facebook”. I must
              confess it was ugly, and by today’s standards, very poorly
              written, but it did the job.
            </p> <p>
              After a few weeks while browsing Facebook using Chrome, the
              annoying ads popped up and I figured that it’ll be worthwhile to
              port it over, so I did. I also made it available to everyone via
              <a href="http://apps.graffino.com/" target="_blank" title="App Development">Graffino’s apps playground.</a></p> <p>
              Months later the due to some policy changes in Chrome, I moved
              to the Chrome Web Store where I made it available for free under
              the name “Cleaner Facebook”.
            </p> <p>
              What happened next was beyond my wildest expectations. It
              quickly gathered around 4.000 users and over the last year it
              surged to 24.000+ users. Whenever I pushed an update, the
              numbers would spike.
            </p> <p>
              I got quite a few offers to sell it, so others could push
              advertising through it. Thing is, I never wanted to make any
              money off it and I felt like I was betraying my users. So, I
              kept it and improved it constantly. It worked so well because I
              needed it to work well, I was using it daily and my users loved
              it. It got a 5 stars rating and over 85 reviews.
            </p> <blockquote>
              Google has been notified that some of your materials allegedly
              infringe upon the trademarks of others.
            </blockquote> <p>
              At the end of May this year, I received an email from Google
              telling me that my extension violated Facebook’s trademark and
              got taken down. There was no information how to solve the issue,
              no way to appeal. Google washed its hands clean and directed all
              inquiries to an automatically generated email address. This
              email address was a black hole that never responded to any of my
              emails.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/bcfd01f.png" alt="Google's notification that they removed Graffino's Ads removal app from the store."> <figcaption>
                The original infringement and taken down notice (shortened).
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              I figured out that the name might be an issue although there
              were
              <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/facebook?hl=en-US" target="_blank">a lot of other extensions</a>
              with the same name in the store. Even so, I changed the name of
              my extension to “Cleaner — for Facebook” and resubmitted it to
              the store where it got placed “In review”.
            </p> <p>
              Over the next weeks I never received any email from the Chrome
              Store other than the initial take down notice. When I logged in
              again, I found my extension was still “Taken down” and the “In
              review” flag gone.
            </p> <p>
              I went on to search for a Developer Support page, but after half
              an hour of searching I found out that there is none. There is no
              support whatsoever for the developer besides Google’s own
              documentation. If you encounter an issue that you can’t solve
              yourself, you’re stranded. There’s no contact info. No one to
              write to.
            </p> <p>
              After getting really frustrated that day, I vented out sending
              out a nasty email to removals@google.com. Not sure it helped.
            </p> <p>
              The next day I poked around and found a support form intended
              for Chrome Web Store users. In my desperation I figured this was
              my only option left.
            </p> <p>
              About a week later, I got my first reply from <em>Google</em>.
              Although it sounded nice, it wasn’t really helpful. Most
              probably due to the fact it was a canned response, totally
              unrelated to my issue.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/a38f41d.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>First canned response</figcaption></figure> <p>
              Later that day, I fired a few other emails, telling them that my
              extension was not under review and the cause for the take down
              was not flagging. I also submitted another message via the
              support form I used before. My requests got closed with a
              <em>“Thanks for your feedback.”</em> canned response.

              Meanwhile my extension’s user base was dwindling, and I could do
              absolutely nothing about it.

                July.
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              After another two weeks I finally gave up and sent this final
              email. I got a reply that my case was “Reopened”. It’s been a
              month and I didn’t hear back since, so I don’t think I will ever
              get my extension back on the store.

              I’m not playing the victim here, and I don’t expect this post to
              solve anything for my extension. I just want you to think twice
              before creating a revenue stream based on the Chrome Web Store.
            </p> <p>
              Google has great automated tools and services, to help
              developers ramp up and deliver their apps to users quickly and
              painless. Most of the time these tools work perfectly. The
              problems arise when they don’t.
            </p> <p>
              I have never experienced such frustration, and such feelings of
              helplessness from any other major player out there. A similar
              issue with the
              <a href="https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.graffino.cleaner-for-facebook-86755BRK69" target="_blank">“Cleaner Facebook” Safari extension”</a>, got promptly solved by Apple in under three days.
            </p> <p>
              Google has a record of very bad user support. Basically, if your
              issue is not listed in the “Support Forums” you’re screwed. If I
              would have based my business on the Chrome Web store, I would be
              out of business by now.
            </p>  <h2>Update 8.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I never imagined this would generate this amount of attention:
              featured by
              <strong>Medium, 100k+</strong> views, heated discussions on
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/51mgix/how_google_obliterated_my_4_year_old_chrome/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
              or
              <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12442048" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>. I don’t really expect this to change anything for me, but I’m
              glad people are speaking up. If Google would implement a paid
              support option like Apple does for its developers, I’m sure a
              lot of pain would be avoided.
            </p> <p>
              I try to read everything, but I don’t respond on Medium (hate
              the commenting system), but you can ping me on Twitter.
            </p> <h2>To answer the most common questions:</h2> <p>1.<em> “Why don’t you change the name completely?”</em></p> <p>
              Well, because using “for Facebook” in the name is considered
              <a href="http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/FairUse.aspx" target="_blank">fair use</a>. Also, when managing an app or extension with that many users,
              you don’t really want to confuse the users by renaming it to a
              completely different thing over night. It’s also an extension
              that only works on Facebook. I might also be infringing with the
              icon.
            </p> <p>
              So, you see, I really need guidelines to do this. Again, my
              problem is with the way this was handled, not the takedown
              itself.
            </p> <p>
              2.
              <em>“The extension was taken down because it was blocking ads.”
              </em></p> <p>
              This is simply untrue. I don't believe I was intentionally
              targeted. I was simply unlucky enough to be targeted by
              automated tools. Even the way my requests were handled weren’t
              done with malicious intent by Google. I think I’m just an edge
              case for which their support tools aren’t equipped to deal with.
            </p> <h2>Update: 9.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I received an email from Google today in which they’re
              expressing their apologies about the incident. It seems that
              they cannot do anything for the current store entry until the
              original complainant retracts his complain.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/3e2eaf4.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>Final email from my side.</figcaption></figure> <p>
              They offered me clear options though. We’re currently assessing
              what the best option might be. As I said in the article, this
              wasn’t an intentional targeting but a slip-up of their support
              which they’re trying to fix.
            </p> <p>
              Hopefully I will have the time to write a follow-up once all
              this is over. I didn’t expect or wanted this kind of attention,
              these have been 2 stressful days for me, trying to keep up with
              all the requests and messages, as I do have a job and my own
              company to run.
            </p> <p>
              It also happens that today is my birthday. I guess receiving a
              response from Google was my birthday present :).
            </p>  <h2>Update: 10.09.2016</h2> <p>
              You can still find the
              <a href="http://apps.graffino.com/" target="_blank">ad blocker extension</a>
              here. However, you will not be able to run it. Chrome made
              changes so that extensions cannot be side-loaded without an
              enterprise profile.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, one of the key discoveries is that it is not always possible that we could measure two physical observables precisely, which is the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>



<p>We might have learned a special case of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle from high school or college physics courses that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. In this case, the two physical observables are position and momentum.</p>



<p>Formally, the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle states that the product of the variances of two arbitrary hermitian operators on a given state is always greater than or equal to one-fourth the square of the expected value of their commutator. In formulas:</p><p>

\[\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) \geq \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^2\]

</p><p>where $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1)$ and $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2)$ are using the notations from my previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">post</a>, $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2]$ is called the commutator of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, and $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = \Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \Omega_2 \Omega_1$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show a mathematical proof to Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>We would use the following four theorems and properties to prove Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h4 id="cauchyschwarz-inequality">Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality</h4>

<p>The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $u$ and $v$ of an inner product space it is true that</p><p>

\[\langle u, u \rangle \langle v, v \rangle \geq | \langle u, v \rangle | ^ 2\]

</p><p>The proof could be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h4 id="imaginary-part-of-vector-inner-product">Imaginary Part of Vector Inner Product</h4>

<p>The imaginary part of the inner product of all vectors $u$ and $v$, $\text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big)$, could be computed as</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>Assuming $u = a_1 + b_1 i$ and $v = a_2 + b_2 i$, where $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are real (column) vectors.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle u, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= (a_2 + b_2 i)^{\dagger} (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} - b_2^{\top} i) (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) + \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\langle v, u \rangle &amp;= u^{\dagger} v \\
&amp;= (a_1 + b_1 i)^{\dagger} (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} - b_1^{\top} i) (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} a_2 + b_1^{\top} b_2) + (a_1^{\top} b_2 - b_1^{\top} a_2) i \\ 
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) - \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>It is trivial to see that</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="triangle-inequality">Triangle Inequality</h4>

<p>Let $z$ be any complex number, we have</p><p>

\[| z | ^2 \geq | \text{Im}(z) | ^2\]

</p><p>This should be very straightforward to the people who are familiar with triangles and know the polar coordinate expression of complex numbers. We will skip the formal proof here.</p>

<h4 id="hermitian-property">Hermitian Property</h4>

<p>If A is a hermitian $n$-by-$n$ matrix, then for all $u, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}$. we have</p><p>

\[\langle Au, v \rangle = \langle u, Av \rangle\]

</p><p>Using the property of hermitian matrix $A^{\dagger} = A$, we simply have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Au, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} Au \\
&amp;= v^{\dagger} A^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= {(Av)}^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= \langle u, Av \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="proof-to-heisenbergs-general-uncertainty-principle">Proof to Heisenberg’s General Uncertainty Principle</h3>

<p>Because $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega) = \Omega - \langle \Omega \rangle_{\psi} I$ and $\Omega$ is a hermitian operator, therefore $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)$ is also a hermitian operator. Based on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">the definition of variance</a>, using the hermitian property, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \rangle_{\psi} \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the left side of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) \psi \rangle \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) \psi \rangle \\
&amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further apply the Triangle inequality,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2 \\
&amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the imaginary part of vector inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the hermitian property again,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, \psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) - (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) - (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) - (\Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \Omega_1 \Omega_2)  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  - [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$ suggests $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 = \Omega_2 \Omega_1$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 | \psi \rangle = \Omega_2 \Omega_1 | \psi \rangle$. This means that the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are the same if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$. Otherwise, if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \neq 0$ the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are not the same. If the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$, Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle suggests that the two physical observables that $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are measuring would have not limit in precision.</p>



<p>In other expressions of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, sometimes we would see the word “simultaneity”. How to understand the simultaneity in Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Given measurement would change the system state, and it is almost impossible to achieve the absolute simultaneity in the time domain, what does the simultaneity mean in this case? Here simultaneity means that the order of measurement $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ do not change the final observation, as we tried hard to make them simultaneous and it is impossible to control the exact order of these two measurements. In short, simultaneity just means $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$.</p>



<p>How to measure the variance of physical observable for a system state, as is shown at the left side of the inequality of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Measurement changes system state in quantum mechanics. We would need to create lots of clones of the system state. Once a system state is measured, it should be discarded and not be used for the measurement for the physical observable anymore. Measurement on the same system state means measurement on system state clones and not the exact system state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It is quite amazing that the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle could be derived in a such simple way. Unfortunately, the my college physics course instructor never showed a proof to this important principle.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>ðŸ¥³</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve been working at warp speed since our <code>v0.7.0</code> release in June, adding over <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/v0.7.0...main">870 commits</a> since then. :sweat:</p>
<p>Here are some of the bigger changes:</p>
<h3>LemmyNet projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet">LemmyNet</a>, where all lemmy-related projects live.</li>
<li>Split out the frontend into a separete repository, <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a></li>
<li>Created a <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client">lemmy-js-client</a>, for any js / typescript developers.</li>
<li>Split out i18n <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-translations">lemmy-translations</a>, that any app or site developers can import and use. Lemmy currently supports <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/lemmy/">~30 languages!</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Lemmy Server</h3>
<h4>Federation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first <strong>federation public beta release</strong>, woohoo ðŸŽ†</li>
<li>All Lemmy functionality now works over ActivityPub (except turning remote users into mods/admins)</li>
<li>Instance allowlist and blocklist</li>
<li>Documentation for <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_federation.html">admins</a> and <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/contributing_federation_overview.html">devs</a> on how federation works</li>
<li>Upgraded to newest versions of @asonix activitypub libraries</li>
<li>Full local federation setup for manual testing</li>
<li>Automated testing for nearly every federation action</li>
<li>Many additional security checks</li>
<li>Lots and lots of refactoring</li>
<li>Asynchronous sending of outgoing activities</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Separated the UI from the server code, in <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a>.</li>
<li>The UI can now read with javascript disabled!</li>
<li>Itâ€™s now a fully isomorphic application using <a href="https://infernojs.org/docs/guides/isomorphic">inferno-isomorphic</a>. This means that page loads are now much faster, as the server does the work.</li>
<li>The UI now also supports open-graph and twitter cards! Linking to lemmy posts (from whatever platform you use) looks pretty now: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6TZ2v7s.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Improved the search page ( more features incoming ).</li>
<li>The default view is now <code>Local</code>, instead of <code>All</code>, since all would show all federated posts.</li>
<li>User settings are now shared across browsers ( a page refresh will pick up changes ).</li>
<li>A much leaner mobile view.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Backend</h4>
<ul>
<li>Re-organized the rust codebase into separate workspaces for backend and frontend.</li>
<li>Removed materialized views, making the database <strong>a lot faster</strong>.</li>
<li>New post sorts <code>Active</code> (previously called hot), and <code>Hot</code>. Active shows posts with recent comments, hot shows highly ranked posts.</li>
<li>New sort for <code>Local</code> ( meaning from local communities).</li>
<li>Customizeable site, user, and community icons and banners.</li>
<li>Added user preferred names / display names, bios, and cakedays.</li>
<li>Visual / Audio captchas through the lemmy API.</li>
<li>Lots of API field verifications.</li>
<li>Upgraded to pictrs-v2 ( thanks to @asonix )</li>
<li>Wayyy too many bugfixes to count.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>Weâ€™d also like to thank both the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet foundation</a> for their support in allowing us to work full-time on Lemmy ( as well as their support for <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/current.html">other important open-source projects</a> ), <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/sponsors">those who sponsor us</a>, and those who <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/">help translate Lemmy</a>. Every little bit does help. We remain committed to never allowing advertisements, monetizing, or venture-capital in Lemmy; software should be communal, and should benefit humanity, not a small group of company owners.</p>
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_docker.html#updating">with manual Docker installation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_ansible.html">with Ansible installation</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Federation</h2>
<p>Federation is finally ready in Lemmy, pending possible bugs or other issues. So for now we suggest to enable federation only on test servers, or try it on our own test servers ( <a href="https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/">enterprise</a>, <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">ds9</a>, <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/">voyager</a> ).</p>
<p>If everything goes well, after a few weeks we will enable federation on <a href="http://dev.lemmy.ml/">dev.lemmy.ml</a>, at first with a limited number of trusted instances. We will also likely change the domain to <a href="https://lemmy.ml/">https://lemmy.ml</a> . Keep in mind that changing domains after turning on federation will break things.</p>
<p>To enable on your instance, edit your <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/config/defaults.hjson#L60">lemmy.hjson</a> federation section to <code>enabled: true</code>, and restart.</p>
<h3>Connecting to another server</h3>
<p>The server <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">https://ds9.lemmy.ml</a> has open federation, so after either adding it to the <code>allowed_instances</code> list in your <code>config.hjson</code>, or if you have open federation, you donâ€™t need to add it explicitly.</p>
<p>To federate / connect with a server, type in <code>!community_name@server.tld</code>, in your serverâ€™s search box <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/search/q/!main%40ds9.lemmy.ml/type/All/sort/TopAll/page/1">like so</a>.</p>
<p>To connect with the <code>main</code> community on ds9, the search is <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code>.</p>
<p>You can then click the community, and you will see a local version of the community, which you can subscribe to. New posts and comments from <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code> will now show up on your front page, or <code>/c/All</code></p>

Here's a summary. There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_heater_unit" target="_blank">radioisotope heater units</a> (RHUs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a> (RTGs) in space. Examples include the RHU used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4" target="_blank">Chang'e 4</a> to survive cold lunar nights, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHW-RTG" target="_blank">MHW-RTG</a>s in the Voyager probes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPHS-RTG" target="_blank">GPHS-RTG</a>s used by Cassini and New Horizons, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission_radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">MMRTG</a>s at the heart of Curiosity, Perseverance, and the in-development Dragonfly. (Interestingly, an RTG using <sup>241</sup>Am has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator#RTG_for_interstellar_probes" target="_blank">proposed for an interstellar mission</a> (<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>), as its 432-year half-life could provide 500+ years of power [<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>].) The world’s first nuclear fission reactor, and the only launched by the US, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAP-10A" target="_blank">SNAP 10-A</a>, a <sup>235</sup>Uranium-Zirconium hydride reactor with sodium-potassium (NaK) coolant which had a thermal power output of 30 kW. It was launched in 1965, stopped working after just 43 days, and has had <em>seven</em> “anomalous events” that caused nearly 50 trackable pieces of debris to be shed from the craft. It should stay in orbit for 3,000 years… unless it breaks up further. The other ~30 known fission reactors were launched in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-A" target="_blank">Soviet RORSATs</a>: nuclear-powered LEO ocean-surveillance radar satellites that required periodic boosts to prevent reentry. They were designed to launch their <sup>235</sup>U reactors to a higher orbit at the end of their operational lives. (These orbits will last 300-1,000 years, but the reactor fuel has a half-life of 70,000 years… so future generations may not love the plan.) But, these boosts didn’t always happen: in 1978, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954" target="_blank">Cosmos 954 RORSAT</a> malfunctioned, reentered, and broke apart over northern Canada with the reactor attached, scattering radioactive debris over an 800 km long path—the USSR eventually paid $3M for cleanup, about a fifth of the true cost. Other satellites have also broken up in orbit, spreading radioactive debris, like the US’s Transit 5BN3 (carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power#SNAP-9" target="_blank">SNAP RTG</a>) and the USSR’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1402" target="_blank">Cosmos 1402 RORSAT</a>. Others, including the higher power and higher orbit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1818" target="_blank">Kosmos 1818</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1867" target="_blank">Kosmos 1867</a> RORSATs, have leaked trails of radioactive NaK coolant. The usefulness of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on NASA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Maximum_Mission" target="_blank">SolarMax</a> mission was reduced by <a href="http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/RORSAT/RORSAT.html#Kosmos-1867" target="_blank">anomalous gamma ray emissions from these leaking higher-orbit reactors</a>.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Bottoms-up growth is a buzzy go-to-market technique right now. From the exciting self-service adoption of products like Figma to the record breaking growth of Zoom, products that enable individuals to adopt a tool without first having to talk to sales is a winning strategy. Customers get started faster, and because they understand the product, they don’t need to be marketed or sold to in order to make a purchase decision.</p><p>But these companies are finding that self-service adoption is only the first step in a customer journey. For the business to grow, individuals and teams adoption needs to eventually lead to enterprise sales. Sure, in the best case that happens naturally as excitement inside the company forces a CIO’s decision. More often than not though, it still requires traditional sales to step in. </p><p>The tricky part is that all that self-service usage data is messy. There’s nothing stopping people from signing up with personal emails or multiple people at the same company from signing up for their own teams, completely independently from each other. All of this easy adoption leaves you with multiple different teams and overlapping users, all working for the same employer. Cutting through the noise for Sales, Marketing, and Success teams requires bringing order to the chaos. </p><p>Today, we’ll talk through how you can structure product data into account hierarchies that are actionable, all within SQL and your Data Warehouse. Here's what we'll cover:</p><ul><li>How to identify companies</li><li>Understanding your current product data model</li><li>Aggregating product data into companies</li><li>Using your new hierarchy</li></ul><h2 id="identifying-companies">Identifying companies</h2><div><p>It all starts by figuring out what real world companies are using your product. And in order to identify a unique, real world company, we need a reliable identifier. Unfortunately, that may not be immediately obvious if you’re just looking at a list of users that have signed up to start using your product. But we have one very obvious hint: domain names that appear in users email addresses. </p><p>Domain names are the easiest place to start building an account hierarchy. They’re easy for humans to understand and debug. And users are often providing them directly to you as part of their email address. Alternatively, you can also ask users to provide this domain as they’re signing up to your product. </p><p>To start building our account hierarchy of companies, we’ll create a set of all the domain names that appear in our database. There’s some obvious issues to this (A very common example gmail.com users) and we’ll address them along the way. So let’s see what domains we have.</p></div><h2 id="understanding-your-data-model">Understanding your data model</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png" alt="Understanding your data model" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We’re going to be translating one model to the other so before we dive in, let's get a handle on what your data looks like currently and where it’s located. It may be spread across a few different tables, it may not even be in your data warehouse (<a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/graduating-to-the-modern-data-stack-for-startups/">you do have a data warehouse, right?</a>). </p><p>One thing to keep an eye out for: does your product have a workspace concept? You might call it an organization, a group, or a team. This group is a really powerful hint we can use for identifying companies. If you do have workspaces, you’ll also need to know who is the “owner” of a workspace. This is typically the user that created it, but you may have a better identifier such as admin.</p><p>With your users and your workspaces, you can use some basic SQL to extract the domain from an email address. For each user and workspace, you now know which Company they belong to. We can use this to start aggregating our users.</p><p>Pro tip: You may have situations where companies are represented by more than one domain. In this case, you’ll want to add the ability to associate secondary domains to a primary domain as part of rolling up workspaces together.</p><h2 id="aggregating-into-companies">Aggregating into Companies</h2><p>The simplest hierarchy is </p><ul><li>GROUP BY domain</li><li>COUNT(*) of users or workspaces</li></ul><p>We’ve got the start of our account hierarchy. We can roll up more metrics from here. For each metric, it’s a matter of thinking about what sort of aggregation makes sense at the company level, ie SUM, AVG, MAX</p><p>What about personal email domain users like gmail.com or outlook.com? Well, that depends a bit on your business. You have three options, and the right option for you depends on what percentage of your user base use personal accounts</p><p><strong>1) Ignore them</strong><br>This is a completely reasonable option and the best place to start. Chances are, users that provided a personal email address are likely using your product for personal reasons. For example, someone using Notion to track their sourdough recipes are not going to be interested in Enterprise Single Sign-on features. So, you may want to just ignore them. You can do that by simply ignoring every domain in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tbrianjones/5992856/">comprehensive list of public email domains</a>.</p><p><strong>2) Roll up to a single account</strong><br>You could also translate all of the personal usage into a separate Public Email catch all company/account. This is a great strategy if you plan to connect these users/leads to other parts of your marketing automation and don’t need company information. If you’re planning on publishing this data to a CRM however, it’s really only worth while if you plan on having a human review the users that end up associated with this account.</p><p><strong>3) Use firmographic data </strong><br>The most advanced option is incorporate firmographic data such as data provided by Clearbit, Zoominfo, or FullContact to translate a personal email address into an employer. Note that this data is not perfectly accurate so you may end up linking users to their previous employers or to someone completely unrelated to them. </p><h2 id="using-your-new-hierarchy">Using your new hierarchy</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png" alt="Using your new data hierarchy diagram" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now that you’ve got your Account Hierarchy up and running, you can start putting it to use.

Census helps you associate this product model with all the other tools you use to serve your customer.</p><p>Here’s just a few ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Enrich your existing accounts and contacts with usage data</strong> - Use this data to give account reps context on what users are doing in product without searching across all your tools</li><li><strong>Identify net new logos</strong> - Use the data to identify companies that are actively using the product but are not yet in your CRM. Congratulations, you now have product qualified leads!</li><li><strong>Orchestrate Sales and Marketing at the same Account-oriented goals</strong> - Account Based Marketing requires Sales and Marketing to target the same accounts, but not necessarily the same contacts within those accounts. Use your new account hierarchy to share target lists between both sales and marketing</li></ul><p>The sky’s the limit! This is meant to be a data platform you can build upon. Add more product metrics, incorporate data form other SaaS tools and more. We’re excited to see what you do with your account hierarchy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>October 08, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>Any successful founder will tell you that team, product, and market are the most critical factors to building a successful business. And you’ll probably hear many of them talk about being “customer-obsessed” or “customer first.” But one of the most underrated factors in their success is not just the customers but also the quality of their early adopters.</p>
<p>While we can all agree that early adopters are good, they are not all created equal. The wrong users can derail entrepreneurs, causing them to lose focus and solve the wrong problems. Like a bad team or poor product, the wrong early adopters can push a company towards failure.</p>
<p>You should be picky about who you serve, especially during the initial phase of your product development process. Finding early adopters should be an investment similar to hiring a team. Entrepreneurs should recruit, interview, qualify, and partner with early adopters that will help them become most successful. It’s not a simple process and shouldn’t be taken for granted.</p>
<p>So how do you find the right early adopters? That’s a difficult question to answer. It’s all going to come down to your market, product, and judgment. But here are some characteristics that you should look for.</p>
<h2>They are in real pain.</h2>
<p>The right early users are deeply affected by the problem that you’re solving. They know the problem exists and are hungry for a better solution. They’ve probably tried other solutions and yearn for something better.</p>
<p>Early adopters will be keenly aware of the problem. They will explain the problem in various ways and how it affects their ability to work, live, or perform some activity. They’ve probably even tried to solve it somehow, maybe using Excel, some no-code app, a third-party tool, or a manual process.</p>
<h2>Their problem is very specific.</h2>
<p>Users have all kinds of problems. Most of which you’ll never solve. Others might be in your roadmap but are not core today. It’s essential to focus on users with the specific problem that you are solving for. Problems can emerge from various systems, workflows, and integrations that have nothing to do with the core problem or your potential solution. Eliminate the users who are looking to solve all of their problems. Eliminate the users who want a different, possibly related, problem solved.</p>
<p>The best early adopters need to solve a specific problem. It’s vital to ensure that it matches your vision and product solution.</p>
<h2>They are excited to help you.</h2>
<p>The solution you’re offering them is going to alleviate a pain point, and the best early adopters are more than excited to help you help them. The more excited they are, the more pain they experience from the problem.</p>
<p>Early adopters are partners. They should be excited about working with you, helping you solve their problem, and providing feedback. They should also be excited that they will be using your solution before others and developing a competitive edge as well.</p>
<p>When you acquire great early adopters, they will be the ones sending you feedback often and with excitement. They’ll be proud to help you craft your solution and feel like their part of the team.</p>
<h2>They are empowered</h2>
<p>Early adopters must be empowered to make decisions quickly. Working with your dream enterprise customer sounds great, but if they can’t get approval, move quickly, or activate your solution, you’ll be at the mercy of their bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Working with early adopters is a partnership, not a transaction. It’s important that early adopters can take your prototype, beta, or product and implement it within their team or organization.</p>
<p>The person is as vital as the company. Are they authorized to make the right decisions? Can they dedicate the time and resources to the problem and solution? Are they empowered to help you create the right solution? If they can’t meet these criteria, you should find another early adopter who can.</p>
<h2>They have a high-risk tolerance.</h2>
<p>The best products are built with customers, through an iterative process of trial and error. Early adopters who experience the pain are not enough; you need a partner who can tolerate the risks involved in the product development process. Not only do they have a high-risk tolerance, but they should also be willing and able to engage in ongoing experiments throughout the process.</p>
<p>Experimentation is critical to the process. You need to ensure that you partner with a customer that recognizes the process is about learning and improvement, not a finished product.</p>
<p>When interviewing customers, you should be upfront about this process and ensure they are comfortable with it. It’s okay if a potential customer can’t commit to the process, you can keep in touch and invite them to the product when it’s a bit more developed.</p>
<h2>Hire early adopters, don’t settle.</h2>
<p>Don’t just settle for the first few customers that show interest in your product. Spend time doing market mapping to better understand the market, sectors, and potential customers. Learn more about the companies and find who the best possible contacts would be. Reach out and conduct interviews to learn more about their organization, how the problem affects them, and their goals regarding the problem and solution. Make sure to dig in and ask tough questions to assess their risk-tolerance, current solutions, and whether they are authorized to make the necessary decisions.</p>
<p>If a potential customer seems like the problem isn’t that big of a deal, you should move on. If they can’t focus on just the one problem, move on. If they aren’t authorized to make decisions, ask about their manager and see if you can work your way up.</p>
<p>You should spend a good amount of time learning about each of these customers and selecting the best candidates. Don’t hesitate to reach out multiple times and have conversations with them to build confidence in your decisions. These will be partners as you experiment and craft your solution, so ensure you find the best possible partners.</p>
<h2>They’re all leads, too.</h2>
<p>Choosing the best early adopters doesn’t mean that the others will not be good future customers. All of these customers are now leads. Some might be great customers once you hit a particular milestone and finish more features; others might be customers down the road. Keep in touch and share updates on the product and feature set.</p>
<p>Recruiting high-quality early adopters is difficult but vital to the success of a company. Spend the time upfront to say no to customers that don’t fit your current vision and mission. While the process is difficult and costly, it’ll be worth the investment as the product matures.</p></section></article></div>]]>

More accurately, the “debate” was a strong adverse reaction from Troy after I shared a template I built for Prota Ventures’ portfolio companies. His feedback was, essentially, to never use a template and instead build each model from scratch.</em></p><p><em>He invited me to a 90-minute lecture he gave where he overwhelmingly convinced me and the room that, indeed, founders need to take the time necessary to build their models from scratch. After I asked him where I could find his lecture material online, he suggested we co-author this article series since there weren’t many solid resources available. We sincerely hope you find this series helpful.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Our plan is to break this out into a four-part series and guide you through the components necessary for building your own financial model from scratch:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/9/15/startup-financial-modeling-part-1-what-is-a-financial-model" target="_blank">Part 1: The Why and What of Financial Modeling</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-2-start-with-your-assumptions" target="_blank">Part 2: Assumptions</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-3-the-income-statement-and-custom-detail-tabs" target="_blank">Part 3: Income Statement and Custom Detail Tabs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/7/startup-financial-modeling-part-4-the-balance-sheet-cash-flow-and-unit-economics" target="_blank">Part 4: Cash Flow, Balance Sheet and Keeping the Model Updated</a></p></li></ul><p>In short, a financial model is an abstract mathematical representation of how a company works (and more importantly, how it will work going forward). The model has inputs and outputs. The inputs are the assumptions that drive the model, things like what drives your customer acquisition cost, what your churn rates are, how much you pay people, etc. The outputs are a set of projections that show how the company will perform if the assumptions are true. One model can produce multiple sets of projections given different assumptions.</p><p>Based on a set of assumptions, a financial model is used to make smart decisions (e.g. how many sales people to hire and what to pay them). The model includes financial projections that are tied mathematically to the assumptions, which allows operators to “play with the variables” in order to understand how certain decisions might affect the future health of their company.</p><p><strong>Troy has an important story to share on this topic:</strong></p><p>“When fundraising for SurePayroll, we had some very high level financials in the pitch deck. Inevitably, VC’s would ask where the numbers came from. I would tell them that we had a very detailed financial model that drove it, I was setting the bait…</p><p>They would ask to be sent a copy of the model and I would refuse. I would only share it by first sitting down with them and an associate and reviewing the model in person and after that 90 minute session, I would leave them a copy of the model to play with further.</p><blockquote><p>They would insist that they could figure it out without the meeting, but I ALWAYS held my ground. I wanted the meeting not just to save them time and frustration learning a new model, but more importantly to get more face time with them in a situation where I was going to shine.</p></blockquote><p>I knew the model inside and out since I built it; I could answer any question about any cell and look like a genius. In the end, I did eight&nbsp;of these meetings and EVERY ONE of the firms that did the 90 minute meeting with me on the financial model either made an investment in the company or made an offer to invest in the company.&nbsp;<strong>Every single one</strong>.”</p><p>While it’s easy to search around and find a template to use, those templates were built by someone with a particular business in mind. Since every business is unique, this will lead you into trouble.</p><p>While it’s often helpful to&nbsp;<em>learn&nbsp;</em>from other people’s models to ensure, for example, that you aren’t missing anything important, you should never build your model using their template. You’ll end up banging your head against a wall when you need to change things, and you’ll inevitably be confused about some nuance that will come back to haunt you since you don’t understand it.</p><blockquote><p>In other words, while you may think that a template will help you save time, what you are actually doing is acquiring “technical debt” that will end up costing you more time in the long run.</p></blockquote><p>Plus, it’s critical to understand every column, row, cell and tab in your spreadsheet for two key reasons; it will help you better manage your business, and when the time comes to explain it to an investor, you’ll be able to explain exactly how it works and increase your odds of landing funding.</p><p>Since most people are using the financial model to communicate projections to investors, it is critical that you speak the investors’ language. They are used to having financials in Excel, so you should build your model in Excel.</p><blockquote><p>Google sheets is convenient for making changes and having multiple people editing, but sending an investor a model in Google sheets signals that you are not financially savvy.</p></blockquote><p>Investors are also used to seeing three standard statements; an income statement, a balance sheet, and a statement of cash flow. &nbsp;Each of these is more credible if it has BOTH the past performance and the future projections in the same spreadsheet.</p><p>Your spreadsheet should contain a tab for each of these outputs along with an “assumptions” tab and custom detail tabs needed to help calculate the main outputs. We’ll walk through a specific example later in this series so you have a better understanding of what this should look like.</p><p>Because of various accounting nuances – such as fixed asset depreciation and deferring revenue – if you assign ten accountants to finish your books at the end of the year, you’ll get ten different answers for how much profit (or loss) you had in the year. While hopefully not far off from the others, each will have a slightly different report of your “profit” based on their accounting opinions.</p><blockquote><p>However, the balance of your bank account is a specific number to point at; it’s a fact that your ten accountants should agree on.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, it’s important to remember that your financial model will have your own opinions baked in regarding your profit. This means that examining your cash flow carefully as you fine-tune your business assumptions is critical.</p><p>Having a solid financial model is a significant step in communicating to investors that you are a logical thinker with a defensible plan and clearly understand your business and the levers that drive it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody expects your model to be perfect, as a matter of fact, when we present a model, we always open with the same line:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The only thing we know for sure about this model is that it is wrong. But, if we look critically at it we can better understand the drivers of the business and what we need to be focused on to reduce our risk.” &nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind, investors are looking for the big home runs, but they are also looking at reducing their risk. The model can help them get comfortable with the risk.</p><p>– – –</p><p><em>In our next post in this series, we’ll dive in a step-by-step guide of how to build a financial model, starting with the assumptions tab.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://satchel.works/@wclittle/subscribe" target="_blank">Subscribe</a><em>&nbsp;to Will’s newsletter to get notified when the next articles are up.

Researchers led by Technische Universität Kaiserslautern (TUK) and the University of Vienna successfully constructed a basic building block of computer circuits using magnons to convey information, in place of electrons. The “magnonic half-adder” described in “<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41928-020-00485-6&amp;t=YWJmMmIyMzc5MTgwYjY4Mjg4NmQzZjA3OTFlNmI1ZTQ2OTRlMWY3OCxRckVLQTR5Nw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632631998427627520%2Fcomputer-circuits-magnons&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603588760"><i>Nature Electronics</i></a>”, requires just three nanowires, and far less energy than the latest computer chips.</p><p>A team of physicists are marking a milestone in the quest for smaller and more energy-efficient computing: they developed an integrated circuit using magnetic material and magnons to transmit binary data, the 1s and 0s that form the foundation of today’s computers and smartphones.</p><p>The new circuit is extremely tiny, with a streamlined, 2D design that requires about 10 times less energy than the most advanced computer chips available today, which use CMOS technology. While the current magnon configuration is not as fast as CMOS, the successful demonstration can now be explored further for other applications, such as quantum or neuromorphic computing.</p><h2><b>Successful collaboration</b></h2><p>The prototype is the culmination of four years of effort funded through Andrii Chumak’s European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, and close collaboration with Jun.-Prof. Dr. Philipp Pirro at TUK, and Dr. Qi Wang, who is currently a postdoc at University of Vienna. Univ.-Prof. Chumak started the work at TUK and now leads a research group at University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are very happy since we managed to do what was planned several years ago and it works even better than we expected”, Chumak says. When he first proposed the magnon circuit, his design was very complex. He credits Wang, the lead author of the paper, with making the design “at least 100 times better.” “We see now that magnonics circuits can be as good as CMOS, but this is probably not yet enough if you want to trigger industry. I would assume you have to be still at least 100 times smaller and faster”, says Chumak. “But this circuit opens up fantastic opportunities beyond binary data, for example to quantum magnonic computing at very low temperatures.” Pirro adds: “We are also interested in adapting the circuit for neuromorphic magnonic computers inspired by the functionality of our brain.”</p><h2><b>How it works</b></h2><p>The nanocircuit components measures less than one micrometer, far thinner than a human hair and hardly visible even under a microscope. It comprises of three nanowires made of a magnetic material called yttrium iron garnet. The wires are positioned precisely in relationship to each other to create two “directional couplers” which guide magnons through the wires. Magnons are quanta of spin waves – think of them like ripples on the surface of pond after throwing in a rock, but in this case, the waves are formed by distortions in the magnetic order of a solid material on the quantum level. It took a lot of time and effort to figure out the best nanowire length and spacing to generate the desired outcomes. Wang worked on the project for his Ph.D. at TUK. “This is the 3rd or 4th design”, he says. “I ran a few hundred simulations for different types of half-adders.”</p><p>At the first coupler, where two wires are very close together, the spin wave is split in half. One half proceeds to the second coupler, where it jumps back and forth between the wires. Depending on the amplitude, the wave will exit either the top or bottom wire, which corresponds to binary “1” or “0”, respectively. Since the circuit contains two directional couplers that add together two streams of information, it forms a “half-adder”, one of the most universal components of computer chips. Millions of these circuits can be combined to conduct increasingly complex calculations and functions.</p><p>“What typically requires hundreds of components and 14 transistors in regular computers, here only requires three nanowires, a spin wave, and nonlinear physics”, Pirro says.</p><h2><b>Future applications</b></h2><p>Pirro, who is currently leading the direction of spintronic computing at TUK in the frames of the collaborative research center “Spin+X”, will now explore using the magnon circuit for neuromorphic computing, which approaches data processing not as binary, but more like the human brain. Spin waves are much better suited for the more complex systems and have the potential to carry a great deal more information because they have two parameters – amplitude, which is wave height, and phase, which is the wave angle. In the current demonstration, the team did not use phase as a variable in order to keep it simple for binary data processing. </p><p>“If this device can already compete with CMOS, even if it is not using the full power of the wave-based approach, then we can be quite confident a scheme using the full power of the spin wave can be more efficient than CMOS for certain tasks”, Pirro says. “And the ultimate goal, of course, is to combine the strengths of both CMOS and magnonics technologies together.”

	<p>If you think that the Sahara is covered only by golden dunes and scorched rocks, you aren’t alone. Perhaps it's time to shelve that notion. In an area of West Africa 30 times larger than Denmark, an international team, led by University of Copenhagen and NASA researchers, has counted over 1.8 billion trees and shrubs. The 1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> area covers the western-most portion of the Sahara Desert, the Sahel and what are known as sub-humid zones of West Africa.</p>
<p>"We were very surprised to see that quite a few trees actually grow in the Sahara Desert, because up until now, most people thought that virtually none existed. We counted hundreds of millions of trees in the desert alone. Doing so wouldn't have been possible without this technology. Indeed, I think it marks the beginning of a new scientific era," asserts Assistant Professor Martin Brandt of the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, lead author of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2824-5">the study’s scientific article, now published in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>The work was achieved through a combination of detailed satellite imagery provided by NASA, and deep learning — an advanced artificial intelligence method. Normal satellite imagery is unable to identify individual trees, they remain literally invisible. Moreover, &nbsp;a limited interest in counting trees outside of forested areas led to the prevailing view that there were almost no trees in this particular region. This is the first time that trees across a large dryland region have been counted.</p>
<h2>The role of trees in the global carbon budget</h2>
<p>New knowledge about trees in dryland areas like this is important for several reasons, according to Martin Brandt. For example, they represent an unknown factor when it comes to the global carbon budget:</p>
<p>"Trees outside of forested areas are usually not included in climate models, and we know very little about their carbon stocks. They are basically a white spot on maps and an unknown component in the global carbon cycle," explains Martin Brandt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new study can contribute to better understanding the importance of trees for biodiversity and ecosystems and for the people living in these areas. In particular, enhanced knowledge about trees is also important for developing programmes that promote agroforestry, which plays a major environmental and socio-economic role in arid regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thus, we are also interested in using satellites to determine tree species, as tree types are significant in relation to their value to local populations who use wood resources as part of their livelihoods. Trees and their fruit are consumed by both livestock and humans, and when preserved in the fields, trees have a positive effect on crop yields because they improve the balance of water and nutrients," explains Professor Rasmus Fensholt of the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.</p>

</figure>

<h2>Technology with a high potential</h2>
<p>The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Computer Science, where researchers developed the deep learning algorithm that made the counting of trees over such a large area possible.</p>
<p>The researchers show the deep learning model what a tree looks like: They do so by feeding it thousands of images of various trees. Based upon the recognition of tree shapes, the model can then automatically identify and map trees over large areas and thousands of images. The model needs only hours what would take thousands of humans several years to achieve.</p>
<p>"This technology has enormous potential when it comes to documenting changes on a global scale and ultimately, in contributing towards global climate goals. It is a motivation for us to develop this type of beneficial artificial intelligence," says professor and co-author Christian Igel of the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>The next step is to expand the count to a much larger area in Africa. And in the longer term, the aim is to create a global database of all trees growing outside forest areas.</p>

        <h2>Fakta</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li>The researchers counted 1.8 billion trees and shrubs with crowns larger than 3 m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the actual number of trees in the area is even higher.</li>
<li>Deep learning can be characterized as an advanced artificial intelligence method where an algorithm is trained to recognize specific patterns in large amounts of data. The algorithm used in this research was trained using nearly 90,000 images of different trees across a variety of landscapes. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2824-5">The scientific article for this study is published in the renowned journal Nature.</a> </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The giant robot looks like a WED Treadwell, <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/robots-i-love">my favorite robot</a> of all the Star Wars droids. I admit, I was worried that it would look organic, like a Sentinel from The Matrix, with wriggling Dr. Octopus arms and pinchy pincers that pinch. But I'm calmed by the robot's EVE-like exterior.</p>
<p>The room is sterile. A dozen masked, gloved attendants in blue buzz. I imagine I'm an astronaut about to step into the rocketship capsule.</p>
<p>Except I won't be going anywhere on this particular journey, unless something goes very, very wrong. In fact, I've already been asked repeatedly by various staffers to describe what I'm expecting to happen in this room over the next few hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm here to remove my sigmoid colon via robotic surgery because of the cancerous tumor inside."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm 34 years old. It's October 12th, 2020. Five weeks ago I was diagnosed with colon cancer.</p>
<h2>Stool, bloody stool</h2>
<p>I've always been a standing wiper. Not sure entirely why. I must have once, accidentally, touched a load of poo during a seated wipe. That sort of thing can change a person.</p>
<p>This charming anecdote does factor into our story, because it means I've always had a pretty good sense for my poo. Consistency, quality, and color, both in the bowl and on the TP. Did you know, there's even a seven-stage scientific classification system for your poo, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale">Bristol stool scale</a>?!</p>

<p>I first noticed blood two or three years ago. On a monthly or so cadence, I'd wipe and notice a reddish tinge. Not bright red, more like muddy-red. Poopy-red. Initially, I thought little of it. Just a minor curiousity. It certainly didn't happen every time. Still, I decided to check off the <code>Blood in stool</code> box on the forms at my annual physical with my primary care doctor that year.</p>
<p>A brief aside on the phrase "your primary care doctor." Like in <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>, the last doctor I really thought of as "my doctor" was my pediatrician. Since "becoming an adult", I've lived in three cities in two countries, which means that I've generally had no idea who my primary care doctor is or was, only that I'd need to find one to give me a referral to get this wart on my foot removed.</p>

<p>Anyway, this season's Dr. Who told me not to worry about the blood. "It's probably hemorrhoids."</p>
<p><em>WTF is a hemorrhoid?</em> I wondered to myself as I said to him, "Sounds good." Googled it after, and I learned that it's a vein that pokes out a little in your butt and doesn't really want to be poking out a little, so it bleeds. Seems like a thing that can happen, so I more or less returned to regularly scheduled programming and just dealt with the occasional poopy-red wipe. This doc also said I probably don't need to come for a physical for a few years, that annual physicals are a myth, dry land in a water world.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2020. Everything sucks. And the bloody wipes are making a resurgence. Because, of course, they are. About four months ago I noticed that my first poop of the day (I usually go 2x) would have this purple-red streak embedded in it, like a racing stripe from hell. And it would happen almost without fail every single morning. That just didn't seem right, no matter what Doctors of Physicals Past told me. And then one morning I felt like I had actual blood dripping from my butt.</p>
<p>Now I consider myself to be a mostly healthy person. I eat fairly well (even though I enjoy the occasional sourdough loaf and hazy IPA), I run and bike and hike regularly, I ran an IRONMAN in 2016 and a few ultramarathons since. I also don't like being sick (who does?). But, like with most things in my life, I want to be "good" at health. An ideal dental appointment for me would go something like this, "Wow, Charlie, these are the straightest, whitest teeth we've ever seen. We'd like you to come in and be the model for our Instagram ads and also be our 3D teeth model for dentures. Congratulations. Here's <em>two</em> free toothbrushes. You also never need to floss again."</p>
<p>Anything that deviates from that ideal makes me squirm and I do think I can fix anything. For what it's worth I still believe that, if I ever encounter a blue flower on a mountain-top, I'm only a few months of mystical training away from becoming Batman. I already have the cape (it's actually a Harry Potter robe, but, hey, I'm scrappy).</p>
<p>At the same time, I counterweight this with a mild touch of hypochondria. I'll see the poison oak in the mistletoe, so to speak. In this case it was a gift.  I googled again for <em>stool, bloody stool</em> and the dreaded <em>colon cancer</em> came back. Last time, I averted my eyes from these search results. But the bloody racing stripes weren't going away. I needed to get myself checked out.</p>
<p>Then I remembered an email from work: I was eligible for a <a href="http://members.onemedical.com/membership_referrals?code=cha0014&amp;source=sa">OneMedical</a> membership. I knew there was hype about OneMedical, certainly I've seen the billboards, but I still wasn't exactly sure what they were all about. It had been a few years since my last physical, as you know, so I was primary-care-less, with a bloody problem on my hands. I downloaded the OneMedical app, uploaded a photo of my insurance card, beep-boop, and I've got an appointment with a new doc in a few days in one of their nearby clinics. Already, I loved the experience - I could text my questions any time (see <em>foot wart</em> above). I'd describe OneMedical as a network of clinics with an app for scheduling appointments and texting with a doc. Sure, ZocDoc kinda does the scheduling thing, but Zocdoc feels like you're sifting through the classifieds. Gimme some non-user-generated-ratings-based curation, please. </p>
<p>So, I met with the doc, liked him a lot, discussed my bloody poops, and sheepishly asked if he'd be my new primary care. He agreed, and he also referred me to UCSF for a colonoscopy. Sure, I'm young, and it's probably hemorrhoids, we agreed, but it's the only way to be sure.</p>
<p>After some jiggling about with the referral documentation, we finally get the colonoscopy scheduled for a few weeks later on Sept 9th.</p>
<p>Then, on August 28th, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman">Chadwick Boseman</a> died of complications from colon cancer.</p>
<p>I wasn't freaked out. Okay, yes, I was very freaked out.</p>
<h2>Colonoscopies are not bad</h2>
<p>What's a colonoscopy? It's a surgical procedure where the doctor goes all the way up your butt to see what's going on in there. You are completely knocked out, so you feel nothing. The only thing you need to do is what we in the business like to call "bowel prep."</p>
<p>Allow me to describe bowel prep: the day before the procedure, you will poop your ever-living guts out for a few hours until you are clean-as-a-whistle, stem to stern. They'll give you a prescription for a gigantic jug of clear laxatives that you'll drink every 15 minutes or so for a few hours. In today's toilet-paper hoarding economy, I'd make sure that you are stocked up, because this gets messy.</p>
<p>Other then the laxatives, you're allowed to drink clear liquids - which is confusing because you can enjoy such clear liquids as black coffee, Gatorade, broth, even green jello.</p>
<p>But that's it. Easy. I watched Stranger Things season 3 again during my bowel prep day. Might not have been the best choice, as I intermittently had to pause Netflix to contribute my own liquified form of the Mind-Flayer, but it got the job done, and I cried my way thru Dustin and Suzie's hymn to childhood, again, as expected.</p>
<p>Okay, next, I woke up on September 9th. My appointment is around 2 PM. Normal day, right?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I decide to walk over to the UCSF Parnassus building in the creepy Mars firelight, imagining I'm the last man on Earth (and hoping I don't step on my reading glasses). Carly makes a plan to pick me up in a few hours in our car.</p>
<p>As expected, the procedure was painless. My only bit of further colonoscopy advice here is to ALWAYS bring a book with you, to every single medical appointment you have, because there's always going to be some sort of delay or waiting room.</p>
<p>An hour or so later, I woke up feeling the feels of that post-anesthesia giddiness. Except no one else was happy. Carly was in the room, a surprise to me. And my doctor looked quite serious.</p>
<p>In addition to two small polyps (which she removed), my colonoscopy surgeon found a tumor in my sigmoid colon. At this point, I don't know a sigmoid colon from a semi-colon, but I knew it wasn't good news. Go 2020!</p>
<p>Despite the odds (my youth, my health), I now had cancer. Well, I probably had it for awhile, but we just found out I had it.</p>
<p>My doc said I'd need to meet with <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/clinics/center-for-colorectal-surgery">UCSF's colorectal surgery team</a>, and I'd also need to get CT scans ("cat scans") to see if the cancer had spread anywhere else in my body.</p>
<p>And so began one of the worst weeks of our lives.</p>
<h2>A brief family history</h2>
<p>Let's talk about the odds for a moment.</p>

<p>We've already discussed my vigorous, proto-Batman level of health. And how I'm a fresh-faced, occasionally-bearded, 34 year old with the heart of a child and the strength of a chimpanzee (no, that's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanzee">humanzee</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of unfortunate genetics, it turns out that I have some family history of colon cancer. </p>
<p>Here's the scoop: my pops (that's cool talk for Dad) has had benign (non-cancerous) polyps in his previous colonoscopies. What's a poylp? It's a little growth thingy in your colon that may evolve into a tumor. Just like how a Charmander becomes a Charmeleon, polyps can grow bigger and more serious with more destructive power. Polyps are usually just snipped out during your colonoscopy and sent off for pathology (aka to see if they have cancer in them). Most do not. This is the case with my dad's polyp experience. Even though none of his have been cancerous, he still needs to go in for colonoscopies more regularly than those who don't have polyps.</p>
<p>My own tumor began as a lowly polyp, perhaps some ten years ago. We don't know exactly. But if I'd …</p></div></div>

<p>Two years ago, we set out to build the best search engine for JavaScript developers. Pika — the original project codename — was designed to help you find better open source packages using data and insights that other search engines ignored. Package size, number of dependencies, side effects, ability to bundle &amp; tree-shake efficiently… Pika analyzed every package to help you make the best choice in less time.</p>



<p>Today, we’re excited to launch our v2 search engine featuring <strong><a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack Discover</a></strong>. Discover combines human-reviewed package recommendations with a quality-focused. search algorithm to help you find the best JavaScript packages, faster than ever.</p>



<h3>Solving the open source discovery problem</h3>



<p>Javascript has evolved, but the way that we find packages is still far too time-consuming. Finding the right package for your project involves a wild dance between <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a>, Google, “this vs. that” blog posts, <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">bundlephobia</a>, <a href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/">dependency tree visualizers</a>, Quora, Stack Overflow… </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="455" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2.png 1000w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2-300x137.png 300w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption>An actual issue that I was once assigned at work.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re in a rush, you might just grab the most popular package and hope for the best. For example, the #1 recommended “date/time” package on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=date%20time%20">npm’s official search engine</a> would be the popular package named “moment”. You install it, build on top of it, deploy your site to production, and… BAM! <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721">Google’s official auditing tool throws a warning</a> when you go to test your website before launch:</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhM0XE3UwAA2Co5?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Replace unnecessarily large JavaScript libraries"></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">@addyosmani</a>: “Lighthouse in @ChromeDevTools now recommends smaller libraries that improve bundle size.</em>“</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out, popularity and search algorithms only tell half of the story. A search algorithm can’t tell you that earlier this year the official Moment.js docs were also updated to say: <em>“<a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/">We would like to discourage Moment from being used in new projects going forward.”</a></em></p>



<p>Finding the right package for your project requires <strong>context. </strong>If a package claims to be widely-used, it’s essential to look deeper. Is it still popular today? Is it well-maintained? Or, has something better come along? Has it been abandoned by the original author? </p>



<p>Gathering this context yourself is a time consuming and imperfect process. So, we decided to bring the context to you.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1024x535.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-768x401.jpg 768w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Skypack Discover: Recommended packages, curated by humans</h3>



<p>Skypack Discover is a curated, up-to-date list of the top recommended packages for popular search terms. It’s like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/">Wirecutter</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/30/9416579/spotify-discover-weekly-online-music-curation-interview">Spotify playlists</a>, but for open source JavaScript.</p>



<p>Skypack Discover cuts through the noise to surface the best packages that match your search. We look at factors like package size, performance, documentation, quality, degree of maintenance, community support and more. If a popular package has been abandoned or better alternatives exist, you won’t find it in Discover.</p>



<p>In addition to package recommendations, you also get additional resources linked directly in your results page: relevant blog posts, articles, video walkthroughs and documentation can all help you make your package decision faster and easier.</p>



<p>Today, over 100 popular search terms feature Skypack Discover results. Starting next month, we’ll begin publishing detailed write-ups of our recommendations: how we arrived at our top picks and our thinking behind them.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, it’s up to you to choose the best package for your project. And now, Skypack Discover can help.</p>



<h3>Skypack CDN: Try out any package, right in the browser</h3>



<p>Installing and testing a package locally can introduce an entirely new struggle, best documented in this <a href="https://lea.verou.me/2020/05/todays-javascript-from-an-outsiders-perspective/">brutally honest experience</a> by Lea Verou.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1.png" alt="" width="966" height="150" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1.png 740w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px"><figcaption>CDN code snippets on every package page!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Skypack makes trying out packages so much easier with a ready-to-go <a href="http://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack CDN</a> link on every package page. With Skypack CDN, you can load and run any package directly in the browser, on demand. There’s nothing to install and no tools to run. As long as the package wasn’t designed for the server, it should run on Skypack.</p>



<p>To try out a package yourself, find it on <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack.dev</a> and then click the “Edit on CodePen” button on the package page. You’ll be instantly transported to a full <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> IDE containing your Skypack import, ready to go. <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> runs entirely in the browser, so there’s no slow startup or unnecessary wait-time required. Just an instant IDE, ready to play.</p>

Tweet us a link to the CodePen!</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Skypack: the future of Pika</h3>



<p>We started Pika almost <a href="https://www.pika.dev/changelog#December%204,%202018">two years ago</a> with a simple mission: make modern JavaScript more accessible. The world of web development looks very different today, and some of the wild ideas that we introduced back in 2018 are now mainstream. We can’t wait to continue this mission into the future with Skypack.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <div>
  <div>
    <p>Due to the nature of the app here, I want to start this blog post with a disclaimer:</p>
    <p>This describes a <em>minor</em> security flaw in the app which has no impact on its ability to function as part of a track &amp; trace system. I also want to be explicitly clear that this bug does not have any privacy impact whatsoever. Lastly, there is nothing nefarious about this bug. It's a mistake (largely on the part of a third-party dependency) and nothing more, one that is easily (and commonly) made.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 Android app, the official contact tracing app for England and Wales, uses signed JWT tokens for its “scan into a venue” feature but does not properly validate the signatures, meaning anyone could have forged their own venue QR codes.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is due to a mixture of JWTs being fundamentally difficult to verify correctly, and a particularly awful JWT library API.</p>

<p>I was able to discover the vulnerability from reading the source code, and getting the relevant app code running on my computer in a test harness to experiment with it.</p>

<p>I reported the vulnerability to the NHS team who fixed it very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="the-full-story">The Full Story</h2>

<p>It all started, as many things do, with <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361">a Tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>okay i actually really wanted to know and its a JWT with</p><p>like</p><p>the whole dang address</p><p>and the name of the place just for shits and giggles <a href="https://t.co/1vx0bTD9zi">pic.twitter.com/1vx0bTD9zi</a></p></div>— laura mcflurry (@freezydorito) <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2020</a></blockquote>


<div><p>For those of you who don't know, these QR codes are for venues (such as pubs and bars) to display so customers can check in via the NHS (National Health Service) mobile app. This makes it faster and more convenient to track who was at the venue, in case they need to be contacted in the event someone else there tested positive for Coronavirus.</p></div>

<p>For whatever reason, the NHS venue QR codes are JWTs, and they are cryptographically signed.</p>

<p>Like anyone in security, as soon as I heard the letters “JWT” I thought: “I wonder if they got the signature checking correct”.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: they didn’t:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle.png"><img src="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle-thumb.png" alt="A screenshot of a mobile phone app: Green check mark. Title: Successful check-in. Large text: Barnard Castle Eye Testing Facility. Smaller test: 30 Sep 2020, 12:53. Thank you for scanning. You have now checked in! You'll be automatically checked out at midnight or when you scan another official NHS QR code. Button: Back to home. Link: Cancel this check-in."></a></p>

<h2 id="background-jwts--signing">Background: JWTs &amp; Signing</h2>

<p>In case you don’t know what a JWT is, it’s an entirely unnecessary and rather over-complicated spec for encoding data in JSON format and: cryptographically signing it, so it cannot be altered; encrypting it, so it cannot be read; both; or – popularly (if accidentally) – neither.</p>

<p>This post is about signed JWTs, and forging signed JWTs, so I’m not going to mention encryption any more. From here on in, every time I say “JWT” I mean “unencrypted, but possibly signed, JWT”.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know everything about JWTs to follow along here, but you do need to know this much: A JWT consists of three parts: a , a <span>payload</span>, and a <span>signature</span> (optional). Here’s an example:</p>

<pre>.<span>eyJuYW1lIjoiem9mcmV4IiwibWVzc2FnZSI6ImhlbGxvLCB3b3JsZCEifQ</span>.<span>40IhxsQj3rVqfQSpdzZTroSs1onXrTJUsy6yC1SadK0</span></pre>

<p>Each part is Base64 encoded, which isn’t important here, and decoded it looks like this:</p>

<pre>.<span>{"name":"zofrex","message":"hello, world!"}</span>.&lt;<span>inscrutable crytographic soup&gt;</span></pre>

<p>The header tells whoever is verifying the JWT which cryptographic algorithm was used to sign it (“alg”), and optionally an identifier for the key it was signed with (“kid”).</p>

<p>There are a number of problems that JWTs are shoe-horned into being a solution for, and one very common one is for verifying data that is passed between services by an untrusted user. For example, service A produces a token and gives it to a user, who then presents the token to service B. Because the token is round-tripping through the user, it is important to make sure they haven’t altered it (or created it themselves), and the token really was generated by the first service.</p>

<p>In the context of the NHS App, “service A” is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">website that generates QR codes for venues to display</a>, and “Service B” is the NHS COVID-19 app. There are actually multiple untrusted users carrying the QR code from service A to service B: the venue owner who prints out the QR code and sticks it up on the wall, and any customers who scan the QR code with their phone. Because of the cryptographic signature, the app can verify that the QR code it scans really was created by the official website.</p>

<p>That’s the theory.</p>

<p>In security and cryptography circles, JWTs used in this way are practically synonymous with “alg=none” bugs. Remember that “alg” field in the header earlier? One of the options is “none”. This, as you may have guessed already, means no verification occurs. This has proven to be the single biggest footgun in the JWT specification, as despite seemingly being a very obvious trap to avoid, many JWT libraries out there hide these details from users and make it very easy to accidentally allow the “none” algorithm.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that this is <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">hilariously and depressingly common</a>, and well worth double-checking if you are investigating any system that uses JWTs or, heaven help you, building one. That’s why this was my first thought upon learning the NHS app uses JWTs, and why I wanted to check if they made this specific mistake.</p>

<h2 id="lets-take-a-look">Let’s Take A Look</h2>

<p>Both the NHS apps (Android and iOS) <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01157/en-us?parentid=CAT-01028&amp;rootid=CAT-01024">are open source</a>, so it’s very easy for someone like me –&nbsp;more accustomed to reading/writing source code than reverse engineering – to take a look. A quick search for “JWT” in each repo later and we find:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-ios-ag-public/blob/a15cebbda5c073f1e0f7b266105110d0d88a7b27/NHS-COVID-19/Core/Sources/Domain/CheckIn/Model/QRCode.swift">The iOS app</a>:</p>

<p>(I’ve omitted code not relevant to the signature checking)</p>

<p>This looks fine. Sure, it’s a little bit weird to do the key checking yourself rather than defer to a JWT library for it. But on the other hand, it’s extremely obvious reading this code that it’s doing the right thing, at least as far as alg=none avoidance goes (I cannot vouch for the cryptography, however. I’m just an alg=none expert).</p>

<p>The key part here is that the signing algorithm is hardcoded to P256, so setting alg to “none” in the JWT itself will have no effect on verification. Additionally the key to use is also hardcoded: it’s passed in to the class via the constructor. The “kid” (key id) field in the JWT is <em>checked</em>, but ultimately thrown away. The JWT is not trusted to choose the algorithm or the key, and in that sense this is a great example of how to safely use JWTs, if you do absolutely have to use them.</p>

<p>Lastly, the payload of the JWT is not decoded or used at all until after the signature is verified. This isn’t really relevant to the alg=none issue, but it is good practice in general to only access signed data after verifying that it hasn’t been tampered with. In cryptography, this protects you from <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">clever cryptographic attacks</a>. With JWTs it ensures you don’t accidentally use attacker-provided data for any decisions in your code if the signature fails, and has a side-benefit of creating a layered defence to exploiting the JSON parser (historically a decent source of bugs).</p>

<p>Anyway, this code looks fine. Great! <a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-android-ag-public/blob/2e37797b9b7b5db5b393280a9ef8b93a19af4964/app/src/main/java/uk/nhs/nhsx/covid19/android/app/qrcode/QrCodeParser.kt">On to Android</a> (again, I’ve omitted irrelevant code):</p>

<p>We start in the <code>parse</code> function and after some basic data juggling, we parse the JWT. Then we check if the signature is correct, and if it isn’t, we bail:</p>

<p>It was in the last great recession that I started doing contract software development, about 2008-2010. The bubble didn’t burst with as much force and shrapnel as in 2000, but it had a distinct dampening of the animal spirits of SOMA, San Francisco where all the startups lived. </p>



<p>It was somewhat by design. The previous job I had, writing Java and ActionScript for a marketing research company was chill enough but felt aimless. I had so little motivation I ended up coasting for a few months and playing a lot of pingpong. I wanted some new challenges, so decided to go freelance.</p>



<p>The first gig I got was off of Craigslist, although I imagine these days Upwork would be a better place to look for work. The project was very limited in scope; mostly adding a Google Maps visualization on top of some grant data for a nonprofit. It was a couple weeks of work, a couple grand, and time to move on.</p>



<p>Some time later a former colleague of mine hired me for some development work at a SF startup doing IP telephony combined with podcasting. This was 2009 so nobody had ever heard of podcasts and smartphones were still a fresh new technology people weren’t entirely sure what to do with. The gig was a fun challenge – enabling people to listen to and produce podcasts using only a telephone, no apps involved. I ended up developing some pretty innovative software that resembled a web framework but for touch tone and interactive voice response (IVR) phone applications. We successfully moved the application from an expensive managed solution to our own in-house platform that I designed, significantly cutting down operating costs.</p>



<p>After some time working on that project, I met a couple of guys who wanted to build a SEO-optimized directory of medical professionals, starting with Spanish-speaking plastic surgeons. I said I could cobble together a search engine in my spare time and was engaged. Some days I would walk the two blocks over from the small telephony company office to the small office housing the nascent doctor directory business and show my progress.</p>



<p>It seemed clear at the time that the podcasting telephony company while highly experimental, was professionally run. It had not one but two Stanford business school co-CEOs running it, with what amounted to a successful track record in the form of an early dot-com electronic greeting card company. Remember those? Weird shit. There were respectable investors, a small team of smart and highly competent professionals, and a beautiful office on Howard St. I recall situated on the floor below our office sat a little room consisting of no furniture save a well-stocked bar with never any people in sight, and a sign on the door reading “GitHub.” I felt like great things could happen.</p>



<p>In contrast, my side gig seemed like some small-time SEO hustling along with a smaller team and paycheck and no Stanford business vibes or major VC funding. I didn’t see anything wrong with that, and still tried to do a professional job, but it seemed like more of a dead end compared to the “real” engineering I was doing, fighting battles with touchy open-source PBX software and voice recognition grammars.</p>



<p>Then things turned out completely differently from what I expected. The doctor directory project kept growing, expanding, and taking on a life of its own. We got a proper office at 1st and Mission, hired an engineer, a designer, a salesperson. Plastic surgeons were mostly ditched, and now we were primarily helping American dentists establish a presence on this new “world wide web” technology they couldn’t quite wrap their heads around. This contacting gig that I imagined would consist of a couple months of basic work kept growing and there was always more work to do. Without any planning or expectations it turned into a real company, with eventually a staff of 25 talented and terrific people and an extremely respectable office in the Financial District. We built software to help all kinds of small medical practices in the US manage their patient communication, from appointment reminders to e-visits to actually useful online medical Q&amp;A. Six years later we sold the company to a large practice management software firm in Irvine, CA.</p>

<p>Following that experience my business partner John and I started a new company together again, this time on purpose. We started hiring and training some of the best young engineers, taking on projects and filling outstaffing needs for our clients, staffing a couple offices in Eastern Europe until covid forced us to go purely remote. This has in effect scaled up from my original single-person consulting operation into a powerhouse team of crack young engineers ready to take on complex software projects. </p>



<p>The classic Silicon Valley VC-backed, Stanford-connected, hip startup went nowhere, and closed its doors. I got permission to <a href="https://github.com/revmischa/asteryst">open-source</a> the IVR framework we built but little else came of it. As it happened, consulting across different clients helped me to gain a broader picture of what was actually possible and break my preconceived notions founded on image instead of substance. I accidentally ended up starting a company which went on to help make American health care just a little tiny bit less terrible, created a couple dozen jobs, and had the profound and unique experience of building up the software for a company starting completely from nothing up through due diligence and acquisition. Along the way I learned some lessons about software contracting I want to share with others who may be considering going <em>rōnin</em> and setting out on their own as freelancers.</p>



<h2>Tradeoffs and Considerations</h2>



<p>It’s my nature to think of everything in terms of trade-offs. Maybe because I have engineer-brain, or because I’m a libra, who knows. There are real benefits to consulting as opposed to being a full-time employee, but also some downsides.</p>



<h3>Legal Concerns</h3>



<p>In America at least, contracting means forming your own business, doing 1099 tax forms and racking up deductions, and drafting and reviewing contracts. It’s more effort and responsibility than being a full-time employee somewhere, as you’re now responsible for taxes and legal matters. Even if you’re not in America, being able to work across borders means creating a legal business entity.</p>



<p>I started by initially getting a DBA, or “Doing Business As” name, under which I could legally create contracts and other paperwork using an official-looking business name. Later on I “upgraded” to a California S-Corporation, which gives favorable tax treatment once your income reaches a certain threshold along with some legal liability protection. If your corporation is sued, all that can be collected usually is what the corporation has, shielding you personally to some degree. A Cali S-Corp will run you $800 a year not counting the time spent on paperwork and taxes you or your accountant/tax attorney will be doing.</p>



<p>Even getting a DBA or Fictitious Business Name is far from simple. In Contra Costa County for example:</p>



<blockquote><p>Within 30 days after a fictitious business name statement has been filed, the registrant shall cause it to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the fictitious business name statement was filed or, if there is no such newspaper in that county, in a newspaper of general circulation in an adjoining county. If the registrant does not have a place of business in this state, the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Sacramento County. The publication must be once a week for four successive weeks and an affidavit of publication must be filed with the county clerk where the fictitious business name statement was filed within 30 days after the completion of the publication.</p><cite><a href="https://www.ccclerkrec.us/clerk/clerk/fictitious-business-name/">https://www.ccclerkrec.us/clerk/clerk/fictitious-business-name/</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>You don’t need to do this yourself necessarily, services like <a href="https://www.businessrocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BusinessRocket</a> can take care of business formation and taxes for a small fee.</p>



<p>One of the first things you’ll need to do is ask your friends for legal services recommendations. If you know anyone who is a contractor or a small business owner they probably have lawyers they work with and can recommend. Or you can hit me up. I enlisted the services of a business attorney to help me draft and review contracts, and a <a href="https://taxninja.com/">tax attorney</a> to take care of the corporation taxes and paperwork. Obviously lawyers are not cheap and in theory you can do all of this yourself, but they can also save you a great time of time and money as well by warning you about common pitfalls and fuckups, and suggest ways to better protect yourself or take advantage of favorable tax laws.</p>



<p>When you are going to agree to do work for a client they will want to know your hourly or project rate and a contract to sign. Understand that around a third to a half of your hourly rate is going to go to taxes, so adjust accordingly. A contract will need to have some important pieces of information. I highly suggest not listening to me and listening to an Actual Lawyer in your country or state about drafting a contract, but as far as software development you will typically need to include a “schedule of work.” This is the scope of what you will be expected to deliver in order to get paid.</p>



<p>Come at the schedule of work with a PM mindset – you have to figure out what the client actually wants and what actually needs to get built. If you end up needing to do more work outside of this scope then it can be a headache, and having a contract which spells out what you’ve been asked to do can make an effective backstop against scope creep. As a related matter, I highly suggest doing per-hour billing rather than doing projects for a fixed price whenever possible, because as we all know the best laid o’ work statement<em> </em>often go awry.</p>

    <p>I had a wonderful shower the other day.</p>

<p>It was late morning (as the best showers often are) and I was reflecting on how I spend my time during the day. As a work-from-home consultant, I constantly need to justify my billing and my time, and in this case I was justifying spending more of it in the shower.</p>

<p>Like most of us, I started my career with the impression that a productive day was spent ergonomically poised over a keyboard typing hundreds of lines of code into Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Edition, and <em>not</em> standing in a perfectly hot stream of high pressure fresh water. However, the longer I spend as a developer, the less I’m convinced I need to be at my desk to deliver the truly astounding spreadsheet-to-web-application business value us senior engineering consultants deliver.</p>

<p>So that you too can justify spending the good part of a morning enveloped in a cocoon of cleansing warmth, let’s break this down and look at 5 physical activities of effective software development. Like all good listicles, this is ordered roughly in order of increasing time and importance.</p>

<h2 id="talking">5. Talking</h2>

<p>Some software development probably doesn’t need any talking to be effective. I understand for example that it is universally considered bad manners to talk about linux kernel development out loud. The contents of ~/bin too, we do not speak of.</p>

<p>But every commercial project I’ve worked on has needed at least some talking. When people are too busy or just too shy to talk, the lack of high-bandwidth communication can make it hard to tease out requirements and unpack poorly explained business problems.</p>

<p>But more importantly, a lack of talking makes it hard to build trust and rapport — critical&nbsp;in early stages of any new relationship. As social animals, we are particularly good at doing this verbally, and not particularly good at doing this with emails and spicy subtweets.</p>

<p>On the other hand I’ve worked on projects where talking is a prop to disguise that no-one knows what to do. Where a dozen people sit in a room and talk for an hour without saying anything and we all walk out dumber than when we walked in.</p>

<p>So for most cases: talking is critical, but in the right amount.</p>

<h2 id="listening">4. Listening</h2>

<p>Honestly I just included this for symmetry. The only thing I’ll add is that we have two ears and one mouth so either binaural hearing offers an evolutionary advantage against some selection pressure or we’re supposed to listen twice as much as we talk.</p>

<p>Take your pithy wisdom however you like it.</p>

<p><em>(quickly googles why do we have two ears)</em></p>

<h2 id="writing">3. Writing</h2>

<p>Writing code of course! But also… READMEs, comments, inline documentation, PR descriptions, code reviews, git commits; this is all part of the <em>core work</em>. It’s tempting to see this meta-writing as overhead on top of the real ‘code’ writing. But effective writing in these other places is a force multiplier for your code.</p>

<p>Much more importantly though, in my experience the best communication is written.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s async, meaning it can be consumed whenever convenient for each reader (i.e. after a late morning shower).</li>
  <li>It can be easily distributed and has no fidelity loss when shared (compared to talking to John about what Sarah told you Steve said in meeting that none of you were at).</li>
  <li>It creates a record, as opposed to “wait, why did we…?”</li>
  <li><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/writing-is-thinking/">Writing is thinking</a>! Writing forces you to structure your ideas coherently (at least, it seems to for some people). It reveals shortcomings or gaps in your understanding or plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this I encourage team comms to be mostly written. Jira, slack, emails, trello, blog posts, whatever. Even a hi-res photo of a wall of post-it notes has been an indispensable architectural road-map at times. However it’s published, detailed, well-thought out writing is 💯.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more important than writing though is…</p>

<h2 id="reading">2. Reading</h2>

<p>Having just extolled the virtues of writing READMEs, commit messages, PR descriptions, etc, I should obviously encourage you to read them. It’s called README IN CAPITALS for a reason, and it’s not just because it’s an acronym. Yet if I had a dollar for every time someone asked me a question that was already answered in the README I would have three dollars. 💰</p>

<p>This is because of what I succinctly call the vicious-reading-writing-cycle-feedback-loop. When people don’t update the commentary, people become trained to ignore it, so people don’t update it, etc. Truthfully, if you know someone’s reading your git commits, their quality will rapidly improve. Even if you’ve never read a coherent git commit from your colleagues before, it’s never too late to ask them to elaborate on what <code>finally fix it</code> means.</p>

<p>But like writing, the value of reading extends well beyond the code repository.</p>

<p>I recently started a project involving a completely unfamiliar field of medical technology (ps you’re <a href="https://twitter.com/danielfone/status/1318026784454045703">still my favourite</a> patient <code>01-004</code> 📊❤️). The most valuable activity I find at this stage of a project is to read.</p>

<p>We have to parse a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Format">specialised file format</a>, for which there is <a href="https://github.com/nsrr/edfize">a gem</a>. But why leave all that useful context buried inside the gem? The <a href="https://www.edfplus.info/specs/edf.html">file specification</a> is not that long, even if it takes many attempts to understand it. Reading the file format spec makes it much easier to understand why the gem needs to <a href="https://github.com/nsrr/edfize/blob/93566cdc82b160ef319c51908c1c4a19666e2625/lib/edfize/edf.rb#L243">load_digital_signals_by_epoch</a>, which in turn suggests alternative solutions to the problem you have in hand.</p>

<p>None of the <em>adjacent possible</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is discoverable without the insights gained from reading these sources, so whatever you’re dealing with, go to the source and read read read…</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentation (<em>reading the very well-written <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html">postgres manual</a> or <a href="https://redis.io/documentation">redis docs</a> is the closet experience I’ve had to Neo downloading kung-fu into his brain</em>)</li>
  <li>code (<em>vastly underrated - there’s not a gem in my Gemfiles I haven’t <code>bundle open</code>d at least once</em>)</li>
  <li>log files, error messages, that tutorial on how to read flame graphs</li>
  <li>the specification, legislation, policy document, NIST guideline, the original paper in the open access journal</li>
</ul>

<p>… you get the idea, just find the authoritative document and slurp it into your brain. Even if it seems like nothing sticks, a brief encounter with the text will leave a long-lasting impression. It’s like homeopathy but real.</p>

<p>So talking/listening… writing/reading… and finally… <em>drumroll noises</em></p>

<h2 id="thinking">1. Thinking</h2>

<p>When you boil it down, <em>this</em> is the main effort for me, and yet it’s kind of the hidden one.</p>

<p>How much of my programming/coding/dev time is actually just spent <em>thinking</em> about the problems?
Modelling the domain,
thinking through the edge cases,
mentally playing with abstractions.</p>

<p>And it’s obvious when you think about what makes good developers. The people I value working with most aren’t accurate typists, they’re <em>clear thinkists</em>.</p>

<p>Yet the image persists that typing is working and working is typing and a productive day is in your chair at your desk.
So we have dual 4k monitors, mechanical keyboards, aeron chairs, touchbar, vim shortcuts, whatever optimises for us tapping away at our computers.</p>

<p>But how much attention do we pay to the <strong>ergonomics of thinking</strong>?</p>

<p>When we elevate ‘thinking’ to core work, we naturally start to optimise for it specifically. In general, we don’t need to be in front of anything to think effectively, and often I find it better not to be. My times of greatest clarity are invariably when I’m moving, often when I’m exercising. Further, I can read on my phone practically anywhere, and the best conversations are often had while strolling.</p>

<p>So while I’m glad for all the ergonomics of my workspace, increasingly I find that writing code is the brief part where I’m simply harvesting all the mental crop that I’ve sown from the talking and listening and reading and thinking.</p>

<p>To distill this into something a little more alliterative, I have sometimes described this as the 3 Ts of software development…</p>

<h2>Talking · Typing · Thinking</h2>

<p><strong>Talking</strong> and listening; the verbal discussions. Most of the time we need a small but critical amount of high bandwidth synchronous comms.</p>

<p><strong>Typing</strong> code commentary: READMEs, code reviews, PR descriptions; and all asynchronous communication: project updates, technical overviews, emails with next steps; These are all an essential part of the job and not just ancillary or busywork. Also typing actual code at some point. But I find the more time you spend typing the other stuff, the less time you need to spend (re)typing code.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong>: (including, for the purposes of alliteration, reading)</p>

<p>Talking, typing, thinking: this is the work we do. And I for one want to give myself the space to do all parts of it really well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I gotta go take a shower. 🚿</p>

Oh… and they made rent.</p><p><em>If you just want to read about Airbnb, skip the following section and pick back up at: BUILD SOMETHING SMALL THAT YOU WANT AND THINK IS DOPE.</em></p><p><strong>Notice that they weren’t trying to build a unicorn</strong>. They just needed to make rent and it seemed like a cool, fun thing to try.</p><p>This is a surprisingly common theme in startups. Travis made a similar remark about the origins of Uber:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>‘’When we first started it wasn’t about taking over the world. It wasn’t about taking on corruption in every city around the world.

You start small and incrementally work your way up. You don’t start with the vision of the trillion-dollar Apple we have today.</p><blockquote><p>‘’I told my father: ‘Someday, I’m gonna own a 4K Nova Computer, so I can write programs.’ And he said: ‘That’ll cost as much as a house.’ And I said: ‘I’ll live in an appartment.’ I would rather have a computer in my life than a house.’’&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_36039"><div><blockquote><p>‘’I was giving away the schematics, passing them out.

There’s no way to create a system that will sort good ideas from bad ideas perfectly.

As for the hundreds of millions to kickstart Tesla and SpaceX? His own money. Which he made from… yup… internet startups. His first project was a small video game called Blastar.

	<p>Mobile phone reception</p>


	


	<p>Uninterrupted, good quality mobile phone reception is extremely important to rail passengers. In technical terms, it’s the pièce de résistance for every network provider because the demands on bandwidth increase with data-intensive applications. Swisscom has now successfully achieved a transmission speed of over 1 Gigabit per second on a moving train under test conditions. This result sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry.</p>

				<p>How do most people use their phones when on a train? Besides checking their mail and reading the paper, they also stream videos, play online games or work in virtual offices. This requires a great deal of bandwidth, meaning that capacity issues can prove particularly annoying. A Swisscom team has been researching and working on continuously improving mobile coverage for rail travellers and commuters for more than ten years.</p>

<p>The invention of a special type of glass for the train windows, which lets mobile telephone signals through, has made it possible to bring mobile coverage directly onto the train without intermediate components. However, coverage along train routes remains challenging as much more data is transmitted under the same conditions with each mobile phone generation. One possible solution is a specially designed antenna corridor along railway lines.</p>

				<p>Swisscom has now made a major breakthrough on a test route between Biberlikopf and Kerenzerberg at Lake Walen with a newly designed four-kilometre antenna corridor: Swisscom engineers achieved a connection with 1.2 Gbit/s on a moving train. Christoph Aeschlimann, Head of IT, Network &amp; Infrastructure at Swisscom says: “This concept sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry. Just one year ago, we had no idea whether this would be possible. We now have a solution that provides stable and reliable coverage for passengers as well as important insights for safety-relevant applications in rail transport.”</p>
<p>Another positive side effect is the lower transmitting power required due to the shorter distances between antennas and devices.</p>

		<p>After evaluating the results, the test corridor will be further optimised and validated with measurements in the first quarter of 2021. The long-term goal is to achieve uninterrupted mobile phone coverage along the main routes for all mobile phone users and providers in Switzerland In terms of the antenna corridor, Swisscom has developed a feasible solution that is also available to other providers.</p>

				<p>A four-kilometre antenna corridor was constructed along the railway line at Lake Walen for the test, in conjunction with network equipment supplier Ericsson. The proximity of the antenna to devices means the transmitting power is lower and the coverage along the railway corridor is more targeted.</p>

<p>In a step-by-step procedure, numerous combinations (4G and 5G mobile phone generations, seating position, type of train car, transmitting power, train windows, mast antennas, smartphone models, etc.) were measured and analysed over more than 200 train journeys. The project has shown that the antenna corridor is possible and offers good performance. Download speeds of over 1.2 Gbit/s were possible on a moving train with a combination of 4G and 5G. The 5G response time was four times shorter than 4G – an impressive 8 milliseconds.</p>

<p>In addition to network coverage, safety-critical applications on rail transport are another consideration. The existing GSM-R railway communication network standard will be replaced in the coming years by the new Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS). Good mobile phone coverage is also therefore crucial for rail companies as well as passengers.</p>

						<p>Science has two stark problems: replication and innovation. Many scientific findings aren’t reproducible. That is to say, you can’t be sure that another study or experiment on the same question would get similar results. At the same time, the pace of scientific innovation could be slowing down.</p>
<p>Does attempting to solve one problem make the other worse? Many have argued that policies seeking to avoid reproducibility issues will create a constrictive atmosphere that inhibits innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Indeed, top policymakers are worried about just this. Along with other prominent philanthropists and academics, I attended a White House meeting on scientific reproducibility early in 2020 (just before COVID-19 really hit). One of the key questions on a sheet of paper that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy circulated for discussion was whether a tradeoff existed: Would efforts to improve reproducibility risk harming the creativity and innovation of federally-funded research?</p>
<p>I do <i>not</i> think there’s a contradiction between reproducibility and innovation. Contrary to common belief, we can improve <i>both</i> at once – by incentivizing failed results, and by funding “Red Teams” that would aim to refute existing dogma or would be entirely outside it.</p>
<p>First, though, let’s take a step back, and briefly review the evidence that significant areas of science could be more reproducible and innovative.</p>
<h2><b>Is science reproducible?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>Many people have written about scientific irreproducibility over the past several decades. But the issue became more prominent in the mid-2000s with the publication of what soon became one of the most downloaded research papers of all time: The 2005 piece “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a>,” by Stanford’s John Ioannidis. (Disclaimer: he is a long-time grantee of Arnold Ventures, where I work.)</p>
<p>To be sure, Ioannidis’s finding was mostly theoretical; it’s not as if he actually redid “most” published research (i.e., tens of millions of studies). Instead, he showed that given the way most studies are carried out, if journals have even a slight bias towards positive results (and they most definitely do), then most of the results that end up getting published would inevitably be statistical flukes or the results of p-hacking.</p>
<p>His theoretical case has been confirmed by many empirical studies in fields from drug development to psychology. Pharmaceutical companies such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> have reported that they are unable to reproduce 80+% of experiments from prestigious journals. To quote Bayer’s scientists, “projects that were started in our company based on exciting published data have often resulted in disillusionment when key data could not be reproduced.”</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://osf.io/ezcuj/">Reproducibility Project in Psychology</a>, which we funded, and which was carried out by our grantee Center for Open Science. That project organized well over 200 psychology labs around the world to systematically redo 100 experiments published in top psychology journals. It found that only about 40% could be reliably replicated (another 40% were inconclusive, and around 20% were decisively <i>not</i> replicated). Since <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716">those results were published</a> in 2015, the study has already been cited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10200793109432081889&amp;as_sdt=5,44&amp;sciodt=0,44&amp;hl=en">over 4,400 times</a> according to Google Scholar. Many of the most famous results in psychology have turned out to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment">unreliable</a> and possibly fraudulent (such as Zimbardo’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication">Stanford prison experiment</a>), and the best recent treatment of this issue is Stuart Ritchie’s 2020 book “Science Fictions.”</p>
<p>To be sure, the problem seems much less acute in harder sciences – e.g., physics, chemistry, cosmology – that have an established tradition of skepticism, replication, or even <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper-MacCounPerlmutter2017ch15.pdf">blinding researchers</a> to their own conclusions. The bulk of the reproducibility and publication bias problem seems to be in social science and biomedicine. In many of those fields and subfields – such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19160345/">clinical trials in medicine</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1092.pdf">high-throughput bioinformatics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000090">neuroimaging</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661314000540">cognitive science</a>, <a href="https://www.niss.org/publications/deming-data-and-observational-studies-process-out-control-and-needing-fixing">public health and epidemiological research</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joes.12032">economics</a>, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-fault-in-our-stars-%3A-Measuring-and-correcting-Esarey-Wu/48403d5dce1f2972c7a91af3bb2d41635221cb3f">political science</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23696308/">psychiatry</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1019294">education</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124108318973">sociology</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Examining-Reproducibility/">computer science</a>, and <a href="https://dennybritz.com/blog/ai-replication-incentives/">machine learning and AI</a> – the published literature features too many false positives as well as conclusions that may well be p-hacked. It’s enough to make folks at the White House, NIH, and NSF worried about the quality of federally-funded science.</p>
<h2><b>Is science innovative enough?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>At the same time, numerous observers have pointed to an entirely different problem: science has grown less innovative these days. (And even if it hasn’t, we could always benefit from faster innovation.)</p>
<p>In a recent piece, Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, and Michael Nielsen, a theoretical physicist, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">made the case</a> that the rate of scientific advancement is slowing down in recent years per dollar spent. Based on surveys of noted leaders in physics, chemistry, and medicine, they concluded, “Over the past century, we’ve vastly increased the time and money invested in science, but in scientists’ own judgement, we’re producing the most important breakthroughs at a near-constant rate. On a per-dollar or per-person basis, this suggests that science is becoming far less efficient.”</p>
<p>Collison and Nielsen are <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26752.pdf">far from alone</a>. Cowen and Southwood <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/sites/brown.edu.academics.political-theory-project/files/uploads/Innovation%20%26%20scientific%20progress.pdf">argue</a> that “there is good and also wide-ranging evidence that the rate of scientific progress has indeed slowed down.” The 2019 <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">paper</a>, “Are Good Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” argues that in semiconductors, agriculture, and medical innovations, “research effort is rising substantially while research productivity is declining sharply.”	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>They attempted to replicate this analysis for “the internal combustion engine, the speed of air travel, the efficiency of solar panels, the Nordhaus (1997) ‘price of light’ evidence, and the sequencing of the human genome.” But they couldn’t do so because there was no accurate measure of the amount of R&amp;D on those issues.</span>
	 That paper concludes by predicting that “just to sustain constant growth in GDP per person, the U.S. must double the amount of research effort searching for new ideas every 13 years to offset the increased difficulty of finding new ideas.”</p>
<p>Of course, some of these assessments might be too <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">pessimistic</a>. But it is depressingly common to hear the world’s most innovative scientists lament that they would never have succeeded in today’s academic or funding system because their work was too outside the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roger Kornberg (a Nobel-winning biochemist) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700794.html">told the Washington Post in 2007</a> that his 1970s research on DNA “would never have gotten the necessary funding” if he had come along in the 2000s: “In the present climate especially, the funding decisions are ultraconservative. If the work that you propose to do isn’t virtually certain of success, then it won’t be funded.”</li>
<li>As <a href="https://www.kqed.org/forum/201310090930/cuts-in-federal-funding-hurt-scientific-research">reported</a> in 2013, “UC Berkeley molecular biologist Randy Schekman won the Nobel Prize for Medicine with two other scientists this week. But he says the kind of basic science research that led to his prize might have never gotten funded if he were applying for grants today.”</li>
<li>David Deutsch, who pioneered quantum computing, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/982233180081029128">says</a> that he would never have gotten his “first research grant on quantum computers . . . under today’s criteria.”</li>
<li>Peter Higgs, the Nobel Laureate for whom the Higgs Boson is named, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system">believes</a> no university would employ him in today’s academic system because he would not be considered ‘productive’ enough. . . . ‘Today I wouldn’t get an academic job. It’s as simple as that. I don’t think I would be regarded as productive enough.’”</li>
</ul>
<p>When so many top scientists say that their own work would never have passed muster in the current system, we must take stock of the current system. As prominent scientists <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6441/613">have asked</a>, “How successful would Silicon Valley be if nearly 99% of all investments were awarded to scientists and engineers aged 36 years or older, along with a strong bias toward funding only safe, non-risky projects?” Moreover, a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/06/07/science-holds-key-unlocking-economic-success/">common complaint</a> is that “scientists are forced to specify years in advance what they intend to do, and spend their time continually applying for very short, small grants” – hardly a system that would encourage innovation.</p>
<p>In short, we have evidence that US science funding is often fairly tame and incremental, that some of the most innovative science of the past would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/19/723326933/billion-dollar-gamble-how-a-singular-hero-helped-start-a-new-field-in-physics?fbclid=IwAR28fazRNhzzT5ijMINwzZkNqlP6fEfBlI4OLyY-eesrUyOfbZfF7-P4qUc">never have been funded</a> by today’s bureaucracy, and that scientific review panels are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/492034a">dominated by insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, innovation in science is imperiled. If Einstein had to navigate such a system, we might <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-einstein-get-published-today-11600974323">never have heard of relativity</a>. And even if innovation weren’t slowing down <em>per se</em>, we could still do better.</p>
<h2><b>What next?</b></h2>
<p>There are lots of ideas about how to improve scientific reproducibility in how federal research is funded. After all, quality control and assurance are hardly new ideas.</p>
<p>For example, we could require that data and computer code be shared openly so that others can scrutinize and rerun it. In too many cases to list, this sort of reanalysis has led to revisions, retractions, and even the discovery of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-a-gay-marriage-study-went-wrong">outright fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we could require that experiments and other empirical studies be pre-registered, so that the analysis and results are less likely to be cherry-picked later. We already do this for clinical trials in medicine, and a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382">review</a> of federally-sponsored clinical trials found that the rate of positive results went down dramatically as soon as researchers were required to pre-register their studies. We could do the same for much else in science. We could even move towards more widespread use of the Registered Reports format, in which journals accept an article for publication before the final results are even available.</p>
<p>It’s less obvious how to reform government funding so as to improve scientific <i>innovation</i>. Let’s try a thought experiment:</p>
<p>Imagine that you were the President 100 years ago, instead of Woodrow Wilson. Imagine that a time-traveling genie from the future tells you that over the …</p></div></div></div>

        <p><strong><em>TL;DR check out the <a href="#color-functions">Color Functions</a> below.</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> is to get access to its <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color">color functions</a> like <code>lighten</code>, <code>darken</code>, and <code>transparentize</code>. These functions are useful because allow defining a color once, then dynamically generating variants of that color for different uses.</p>
<p>For example, here's an <code>alert</code> component that needs three shades of blue.</p>
<p data-height="150" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="gschier" data-slug-hash="VwjYazv" data-pen-title="VwjYazv">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/gschier/pen/VwjYazv">
  yLJajep</a> by Gregory Schier (<a href="https://codepen.io/gschier">@gschier</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


<p>With the help of the <code>transparentize</code> and <code>darken</code> SASS functions we can generate the color variants needed for the light background and dark text.</p>
<div>
        
        <pre data-line=""><code>$color: #4299E1; // Blue

.alert {  
  // Subtle tinted background
  background-color: transparentize($color, 0.9);

  // Colored border
  border: 1px solid $color;

  // Color text, darkened for good contrast
  color: darken($color, 20%);
}</code></pre>

        </div>
        
<p>But, what if you can't use a preprocessor? Well, you're in luck! CSS doesn't include built-in color functions, but <strong>this post demonstrates how to combine <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS Custom Properties (variables)</a> with the <code>hsl</code> color model to achieve the same thing.</strong></p>
<p>To implement these color manipulations, we need to think outside the box. Here's the general strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break colors into three variables: hue, saturation, and lightness</li>
<li>Combine HSL variables with <code>hsl(360, 100%, 100%)</code> color syntax</li>
<li>Use the CSS <code>calc</code> function to manipulate HSL variables</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the previous <code>alert</code> component implemented using our vanilly-CSS strategy.</p>
<div>
        
        <pre data-line=""><code>:root {
  --color-h: 207; /* Hue        */
  --color-s: 73%; /* Saturation */
  --color-l: 57%; /* Lightness  */
}

.alert {
  /* Colored border */
  border: 2px solid hsl(
    var(--color-h), 
    var(--color-s), 
    var(--color-l)
  );

  /* Subtle tinted background */
  background-color: hsla(
    var(--color-h),
    var(--color-s),
    var(--color-l),
    0.1
  );

  /* Color text, darkened for good contrast */
  color: hsl(
    var(--color-h), 
    var(--color-s), 
    calc(var(--color-l) * 0.7)
  );
}

/*
 * BONUS!
 * 
 * CSS variables are scoped, so can easily be changed
 * based on a given class.
 *
 * In SASS, this would actually be MORE difficult, requiring
 * use of mixins.
 */
.alert.danger {
  --color-h: 0; /* Change hue to red */
}</code></pre>

        </div>
        
<p>The resulting output is the exact same as the SASS example, except we didn't need a preprocessor to do it! 🤯</p>

<h2 id="color-functions" tabindex="0">Color Functions<a href="#color-functions">#</a></h2>
<p>The first example in this post demonstrated how to darkening a color and adding transparency, but there's a lot more that can be done too. Here are the most useful examples.</p>
<h3 id="shift-hue" tabindex="0">Shift Hue<a href="#shift-hue">#</a></h3>
<p>The hue can be rotated by adding a value, in degrees, to the hue variable. Note, hue ranges from 0-360 degrees but will still work if it's exceeded (ie. <code>30</code> is the same hue as <code>30 + 360 = 390</code>)</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  calc(var(--color-h) + 80),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="transparentize-alpha" tabindex="0">Transparentize (Alpha)<a href="#transparentize-alpha">#</a></h3>
<p>Transparency can be set using <code>hsla</code> to specify the desired alpha value.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsla(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l),
  0.5 /* specify alpha channel */
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="adjust-lightness" tabindex="0">Adjust Lightness<a href="#adjust-lightness">#</a></h3>
<p>Lightness can be adjusted by multiplying by a value greater than <code>0</code>. Values between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> will darken, while values greater than <code>1</code> will lighten.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 &lt; n &lt; 1 darkens, n &gt; 1 lightens */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),

<h2 id="why-do-this" tabindex="0">Why Do This?<a href="#why-do-this">#</a></h2>
<p>We've just seen how vanilla CSS can be used to manipulate colors but <strong>why wouldn't we just use a preprocessor?</strong> Well, even though CSS is more verbose, there <em>are</em> some benefits.</p>
<p><strong>1) Dynamic theming:</strong><br>
The largest benefit of CSS variables variables is the ability to change them at runtime using JavaScript<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This makes adding dark mode or user-customizable themes trivial, for example. In fact, <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> relies heavily on CSS variables for it's theme system.</p>
<p><strong>2) Scoped variables:</strong><br> 
We saw in the previous example how we generated a red alert by simply changing the hue variable within the <code>.alert.danger</code> selector. This is because CSS variables are scoped. Since SASS does not support scoping like this, we'd have to add complexity by using <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin">mixins</a> instead.</p>
<p><strong>3) Preprocessors are a pain:</strong><br>
Not having to setup a preprocessor like SASS can be a huge benefit for simple projects and beginners. There are also some projects where a preprocessing step won't be an option at all.</p>
<p>So, with a little creative thinking, we were able to implement all off SASS's color manipulation functions using CSS variables and <code>calc()</code>. Perhaps one day CSS will have these functions build in but, until then, this will suffice.</p>

October 21, 2020 | https://artofemails.com/trump-emails | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://artofemails.com/trump-emails">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Trump sends on average 10-12 emails a day</h2>
<p>Here's a look at the emails his team sent in one day:
<img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-how-many-emails-a-day.png" alt="Trump sends 10-12 emails a day on average">
</p><h2>Trump uses several different sender names for his emails</h2>
<p>Trump’s team uses different senders names for his emails including:
</p><p>Official Trump Campaign Store
<br>Donald J. Trump
<br>Trump 1000 Club
<br>Donald Trump Jr.
<br>Eric Trump
<br>Official Trump Polling
<br>Trump Match Alert
<br>Mike Pence
</p><p>
Different sender names lets them resend similar offers and messages with a fresh approach. For example, they often offer a 800% donation match in their emails and one of them came from Donald Trump Jr. saying:
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Nothing can keep my father down.
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-sender-name.png" alt="Trump uses different sender names for his emails">
</p></div>
<h2>Subject lines are often short and punchy; the longest ones are only 8-9 words.</h2>
<p>Interesting subject lines:
</p><p>(1) UNOPENED MESSAGE
<br>You + Me in LA
<br>You’re going to love this.
</p><h2>Psychological tactics that Trump's emails use often</h2>
<h5>Match incentives</h5>
<p>Trump’s emails often offer a 800% match for donations to give supporters the feeling making even a small contribution would make a difference. These emails have buttons with different donation amounts and their total amount after the 800% match.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>800%-MATCH
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive.png" alt="Trump email 800% matching incentive">
</p></div>
<p>Using different approaches, Trump’s team sends the most emails about his offer to match donations.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>📎 Matching Check Attached
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive-2.png" alt="Trump email 800% matching check">
</p></div>
<h5>Exclusivity</h5>
<p>In some emails, Trump taps into people’s desire to feel like they belong to something bigger than themselves. They position donating to the campaign as joining an exclusive club and elevate its prestige by offering a personalized membership card.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Become a Platinum Member
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-exclusivity-personalized-membership-card.png" alt="Trump email donate to join exclusive club">
</p></div>
<p>The Trump team sends different versions of this approach so they feel like fresh offers.
</p><p>Here’s one from Kimberly Guilfoyle, an advisor to Donald Trump, inviting you to join the exclusive Trump 100 Club.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>You’re going to love this.
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-exclusivity-100-club.png" alt="Trump email donate to join 100 club">
</p></div>
<h5>Ego boost</h5>
<p>A handful of Trump’s emails try to make you feel special and give you the opportunity to stand out as a highly valued supporter.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>I want to do something special for you
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-ego-boost.png" alt="Trump emails donate to join 100 club">
</p></div>
<h5>Win something</h5>
<p>A few of Trump’s emails offer you the chance to win a trip to meet him if you make a donation. Beyond having your travel expenses covered, they tap into your desire to meet someone important.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>🌞 Sunny LA 🌞
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-win-trip-to-la.png" alt="Win a trip to LA to meet Trump">
</p></div>
<h5>Guilt</h5>
<p>Some of Trump’s emails encourage you to donate by creating the feeling that he’s really counting on you and you’d be letting him down if you don't.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Contribution Status: MISSING
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive-3.png" alt="Trump's matching incentive: don't let him down">
</p></div>
<p>This email explicitly says Trump would be disappointed if you did not donate, with a picture of him looking sternly at you.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>President Trump is calling on his top supporters

October 21, 2020 | https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-radar-2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-radar-2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Insurance tech is having its moment. Startups in the space received <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-startups-investor-quality-q2-q3-2020">$33b of funding</a> in 2019, the largest amount in the industry’s short history. As we head into the last quarter of 2020, we’re seeking to better understand where insurtech startups are filling traditional insurance market gaps.</p><p>Insurance products compete on two axes: customer experience and underwriting accuracy. Over the past half-decade, insurtech startups have used machine learning and data collection capabilities to hit on both of these axes, catering to digital, transparent, on-demand consumer preferences. Customers can now manage the entire insurance experience online — from policy shopping to claims settlement — with lower premiums than traditional insurers.&nbsp;</p><p>                                                       <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/app/insurance_now">The full Radar can be found <strong>here</strong>.</a></p><p>To dig into the startups in this area, we turned to our <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/products/radar">Radar</a> product, <em>a market map on steroids</em> that adds context to sectors and helps identify startups filling market gaps. In this Radar, we identified 20 sectors filling 3 primary market gaps: a product experience gap, an insurance product gap, and an underwriting gap. This piece briefly walks through each gap with example startups in each category.</p><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/radiclewebsite/502a4c68-a736-436e-b36d-12e80f6dd6ba_Screen+Shot+2020-09-14+at+2.34.51+PM.png?auto=compress,format" alt=""></p><p><strong>Product Experience Gap</strong></p><p>The product experience gap fills in a key hole where legacy insurers have traditionally failed: customer experience. New-age, digital solutions are providing transparent policies, immediate claim fulfillment, and active customer support. Solutions addressing this gap sit across the entire spectrum of insurance products. Example sectors include Auto Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://clearcover.com/">Clearcover</a>), Travel Insurance Providers (<a href="https://pluto.travel/cover">Pluto</a>), and Homeowners Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://www.hippo.com/">Hippo</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Take Clearcover as an example. Clearcover offers simple, online-only auto insurance with an improved customer experience. Through the company's app, policyholders can instantly file claims (which are paid within a few days), manage bill payments, and provide proof of insurance without the need for a wifi connection or cell service. Additionally, Clearcover's policies include "alternate transport coverage," a more flexible repair stipend compared to traditional insurer's rental car coverage. With alternate transport coverage, Clearcover customers can spend their stipend on public transportation, rental car coverage, and ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft.</p><p>Or consider Pluto, a travel insurance provider. Pluto addresses the opaque and bureaucratic qualities of the travel insurance industry by making policies easy to understand. Through Pluto's smartphone app, customers can evaluate and purchase jargon-free coverage options, receive access to medical assistance, and submit claims for events like flight delays in 10 minutes or less.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insurance Product Gap</strong></p><p>The insurance product gap addresses cohorts that previously had little or no coverage. This encompasses solutions like Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers (<a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a>), Ridesharing Insurance (<a href="https://www.buckleup.com/">Buckle</a>), and Drone Insurance Digital Brokers (<a href="https://www.thimble.com/verifly-drone-insurance">Thimble</a>).</p><p>One start-up addressing the insurance product gap is <a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a> (Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers), a home insurance provider for rental hosts. Since standard homeowner’s insurance policies don’t cover Airbnb rentals, home-share hosts are vulnerable to denied claims or even canceled coverage if their insurer discovers that their home doubles as a business. Slice helps solve this problem by supplementing a host’s existing homeowner’s policy and eliminating the possibility of losses being reported to the host’s insurer. What’s more, Slice is unique in that its insurance offering is completely on-demand: coverage is billed by the night, and hosts only pay for the exact amount of coverage they need.&nbsp;</p><p>Other startups like <a href="https://www.buckleup.com/">Buckle</a> focus on underserved segments of the auto market. Buckle provides rideshare drivers with one policy to cover their personal driving and rideshare driving. Instead of supplementing an existing auto policy, Buckle replaces a driver’s current auto insurance and provides continuous 24x7 coverage at one low rate. While traditional insurance companies evaluate factors like age and driving history, Buckle takes other driving elements into account, such as rideshare star rating. Buckle launched its core rideshare insurance policy in 2019 and announced a partnership with Lyft earlier this year.</p><p><strong>Underwriting Gap</strong></p><p>The underwriting gap addresses high consumer policy cost through providing more accurate, personalized underwriting.

                  <p>Want to get better at something or at least do it more? Make it as easy as possible.</p>

<p>I’ve been making music at home for a long time, and have been talking to people about making music at home for even longer. During that time, the single best piece of advice I’ve gotten from people I admire is this: leave your gear set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/1*J1S_DFJBFoikbMv2-vk-jA.jpeg" alt="Buy my records please"><em>Buy my records please</em></p>

<p>If you want to play more, or get better, or both, having everything all set up and ready to go will make you approximately 1,000,000 times more likely to actually do it. This is scientifically proven.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the other day that this idea potentially generalizes to a whole bunch of other things that people typically want to do more or get better at: exercising, writing, making pottery, whatever.</p>

<p>The basic idea is this: make it as easy as possible to just get started and you’ll be so much more likely to actually do it. For running, maybe that means setting time aside and setting your clothes and shoes out the night before. Writing? A quiet spot and fifteen minutes should be enough.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What gear do I have stashed in the closet, messy and unplugged, that should actually be out and ready on my desk, ready to make my next hit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you’ve got your answer, take tonight to set it up, and make tomorrow day one of a long, fulfilling streak.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Back in 2010 I was contemplating my next move after working on Microsoft's Project Oslo. Oslo was an effort to deliver 10X productivity to developers which inspired me to set the following criteria for my next job:</p><ol><li><strong>Iterate with Developers:</strong> I want to work in a place where we can start small, get something in the hands of developers and then iterate over the product to solve real problems.</li><li><strong>Cloud:</strong> So far I had been focussed on building platforms using bare-metal products.  But I was starting to see the kind of requirements modern applications have around scale and resiliency.  I knew Cloud had to be huge part of the experience to deliver on those requirements.</li></ol><h2>Start of Journey</h2><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jv8et2b448mjtifrh1wy.png" alt="Alt Text"></p><p>The Oslo framework led me to join the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/swf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Simple Workflow (SWF)</a> team.  The team was led by Maxim Fateev, who came from a strong messaging background. Maxim was one of the most brilliant software engineers I had ever worked with, especially when it came to designing large scale distributed systems.  Little did I know that I was about to embark on a long journey which is still being written to this day.</p><p>When I joined, the team was wrapping up a second version of the service which was already seeing decent usage within AWS.  Even at the time, we could clearly see a pattern emerging. Developers were spending significant amounts of time building resiliency into applications, using low level primitives like queues, databases, retry mechanisms, durable timers, etc. Those same developers were able to produce higher quality systems with far less effort when using SWF instead of implementing resiliency themselves.  Considering how useful the service was within AWS, the next natural step was to offer SWF publicly. I was part of the core team which worked on the public version of SWF which was launched in early 2012.</p><h2>Durable Task Framework (DTFx)</h2><p><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/monitor.png"></p><p>After shipping the public SWF service, I took an opportunity at Microsoft Azure and ended up joining the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Service Bus</a> team that owns the messaging stack for Azure.  Cloud was steadily gaining momentum and as more and more workloads started to get migrated, teams like Azure Service Bus became a focal point.  As application developers increasingly started adopting microservices architecture to keep up with scale and availability requirements for modern applications, services like Azure Service Bus became the backbone to orchestrate calls across microservices.  To keep up with the explosive growth, I worked as part of the team focused on large scale ingestion through <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure EventHubs</a>.  This solved the scalability and reliability issues at a messaging layer but developers still had to work with very low level primitives whenever they need to reliably orchestrate calls across microservices.  The result was complex architectures which were expensive to build, hard to operate, and still came with reliability challenges. Reliability challenges stemming from all sorts of failure cases which needed to be handled due to the distributed nature of the application.</p><p>I could clearly see that the developers building applications on Microsoft Azure were facing eerily similar challenges to what I had seen back at AWS. The same challenges we had tried to address with SWF.  So I used one of the internal team hackathons as an opportunity to pair up with Affan Dar and take another stab at solving the problem. Affan had a very deep understanding of Azure ServiceBus so he was the perfect person to build the backend for the stateful C# experience I had in mind.  Microsoft had recently added async/await capabilities into C# and it turned out to be an amazing fit for writing stateful applications which need to orchestrate calls among microservices.  Since Java lacked an async/await like primitive, we had to rely on Promise-based async approach when building SWF.  But with C#, we were able to deliver a much cleaner and synchronous programming model using async/await.  This hackathon project resulted in Azure <a href="https://github.com/Azure/durabletask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Durable Task Framework</a> as an OSS client SDK which uses Azure ServiceBus as the backend to provide a stateful workflow-as-code experience for applications. I'm so glad to see Microsoft has continued investing in the experience with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Durable Functions</a> as the latest reincarnation of the original effort. An effort which started with that hackathon project.</p><h2>Transportation as Reliable as Running Water</h2><p><img src="https://d3i4yxtzktqr9n.cloudfront.net/uber-sites/f452c7aefd72a6f52b36705c8015464e.jpg"></p><p>In 2015, Uber opened a development center in Seattle and I decided to take the leap and join the engineering team.  Coincidently enough, Maxim Fateev ended up joining the Uber team in Seattle only a month after I did. At the time, Uber was running on Kafka 7 as the messaging backbone. Based on the scale they were running, they were encountering some serious operational issues. Considering Maxim and I had more than a decade worth of experience building messaging systems similar to Kafka, we decided to create the OSS project <a href="https://github.com/uber-archive/cherami-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherami</a> to address this Uber sized problem. After a year of working on the project, we were observing a very similar pattern to the one that we tried to solve with SWF and Durable Task Framework. When engineers needed to build with raw infrastructure primitives like queues and databases they were spending 80% of their time building resiliency into the application.  This was clearly not sustainable for Uber, which was growing at an amazing pace and building a brand of "Transportation as Reliable as Running Water".  This need to increase developer productivity without compromising on reliability of the system was the motivation for Maxim and I to create the OSS project <a href="https://github.com/uber/cadence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cadence</a>.  Within a very short period of time, we built a multi-tenant service hosted by our team. Cadence provided a great developer experience by enabling developers to use Golang to build and run stateful applications with very little operational overhead.  Cadence grew organically within Uber and quickly became popular among developers. It slowly but surely began to emerge as the standard way to build stateful applications when reliability cannot be compromised.</p><h2>Magic of Open Source</h2><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8llekr4lqjmaok138su4.png" alt="Alt Text"></p><p>Today, more businesses are turning to software for running mission critical parts of the system and software is becoming key part of the end-user experience. The problems faced by engineers at places like AWS, Microsoft Azure and Uber have become more and more common across the industry.  This belief was validated in early 2019. Developers from companies like Hashicorp, Box, Doordash, Checkr and dozens of other places organically discovered the Temporal technology and immediately started using it for their mission critical workloads.</p><p>We have a strong belief that an infrastructure technology of this magnitude needs to built as an Open-source project.  This led both Maxim and I to quit our jobs at Uber and launch <a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal Technologies</a> in October 2019.  Over the last year we made huge advances with our developer experience and released <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal</a> as an Open Source Software under <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT license</a>.  We recently launched our first production release of <a href="https://docs.temporal.io/blog/temporal-v1-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal v1.0.0</a> which is already being used by numerous companies for critical workloads.</p><p><a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://temporal.io</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/temporalio/temporal</a></p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The web application my development team is building at work provides a lot of data to our users, including downloadable Excel spreadsheets that can sometimes contain up to 250,000 rows’ worth of information. And our users have the ability to generate these reports, on demand, from our tool.</p><p>As you may imagine, it can sometimes take several minutes or more to compile this much data, and waiting around looking at a loading animation while our report service crunches numbers in the background wouldn’t be a great user experience.</p><p>Instead, we needed a way to check when the report service was done generating a report, without blocking a user from doing other work in our application while that was going on. We needed <strong>polling</strong>.</p><p>Sometimes when building web applications, you’re going to need to keep track of data being created or updated asynchronously by another service. Polling, is one way to accomplish this, and all it is, is simply hitting an API’s endpoint to retrieve any new data at a set interval of time.</p><p>This is exactly the type of solution my team needed to implement — a way to periodically keep checking if the reports (being generated by our separate report service) were done, so they could be displayed in the UI for our users to download once they were. And we needed a solution that would work for React.</p><p>Today, I’ll be sharing how easy it is to leverage a custom React Hook called <code>useInterval</code>, to poll an API within your application for fresh data (or really run any task that needs intervals).</p><h2 id="polling-vs-webhooks">Polling VS Webhooks</h2><p>An alternative to polling is webhooks. Webhooks are a common way for one app to notify of an event, in real-time, to another app.</p><p>Webhooks are often referred to as “reverse APIs” because the app consuming the data does not do so by sending an HTTP request to another API — instead, it makes an API available for the app sending the data (usually, a POST HTTP request).</p><h3 id="example-getting-notified-when-a-new-component-is-available">Example: Getting notified when a new component is available</h3><p>Let’s say one of your teammates has published a component to your shared component collection. You might want to use it in your current project but how would you know that it’s now available?</p><p>One way would be by polling. </p><p>Another, more elegant and efficient way, would be by using <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/introducing-bit-dev-webhooks-78dade77c6da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">webhooks</a>.</p><hr><p>Why am I telling you about webhooks in a post about polling? Well, it’s something to keep in mind when you’re building a solution for a problem that’s potentially solved by both techniques. It may very well be that you don’t actually have an option and polling is the only available solution but if that’s not the case, you should at least consider webhooks.</p><h2 id="intervals-from-react-classes-to-react-hooks">Intervals from React Classes to React Hooks</h2><p>Before I dive into the custom useInterval Hook, let me briefly review how polling at intervals used to work in React when we could only use class-based components to work with our state.</p><h3 id="setinterval-the-old-way-to-poll-in-react-classes">SetInterval: The Old Way to Poll in React Classes</h3><p>Back in the days when we used to be restricted to class-based components for state changes, polling was typically started on the <code>componentDidMount()</code> lifecycle method as soon as the component was mounted in the DOM. And as long as the component stayed mounted, the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>setInterval()</code></a> function would continue indefinitely. Upon unmounting the component with <code>componentWillUnmount()</code>, the interval will be cleared and stop running with <code>clearInterval()</code>. Here’s an example of that code below.</p><p><code>PollingSample.js</code></p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/ef90ba3421b77b0c451dfc783ca3f15e/c701c/c95e598281bb4994840116dd477da69f.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/ef90ba3421b77b0c451dfc783ca3f15e/c701c/c95e598281bb4994840116dd477da69f.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" alt="how-polling-intervals-used-to-work-in-React">
<em>A simple example of how polling intervals used to work in React.</em></p><p>In the example above, I just have the <code>PollingExample</code>’s <code>pollingCount</code> state updating every 3 seconds, as determined by the <code>delay</code>, which is currently set to 3000ms.</p><p>When the component mounts, the <code>setInterval()</code> starts running, and every 3 seconds it increments the <code>pollingCount</code>’s state by 1 by calling the <code>tick()</code> function, which actually updates the state. Once the <code>PollingExample</code> component unmounts from the DOM, the <code>clearInterval()</code> function is called and the interval stops running.</p><p>This works fine, but if multiple components need intervals to poll for different data or execute other tasks on an interval, there can be a lot of redundant, interval-related code scattered among the components.</p><p>Setting up a running interval is pretty simple, but now that we’ve got React Hooks there’s an even simpler, cleaner way to encapsulate polling data into a custom Hook.</p><h3 id="useinterval-the-new-way-to-poll-with-react-hooks">UseInterval: The New Way to Poll with React Hooks</h3><p>When React Hooks first came out, people were critical that <code>setInterval()</code> didn’t work with Hooks the way that it had with React’s class-based components.</p><p>And it’s true, it doesn’t. Dan Abramov <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wrote</a> a very in-depth explanation of why this is the case (and does a fantastic job of explaining it, so I’ll continue to leave that to him). But in addition to demystifying how <code>setInterval()</code> works with React’s lifecycles like <code>componentDidMount()</code>, he also introduced the new Hooks-way of correctly writing intervals to work in function-based React components.</p><p>He introduced a new custom hook called <code>useInterval</code>, and it’s awesome, easy to use, and just what my team needed. Here’s the code for the Hook, taken just as Dan <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wrote</a> it, and added right to my team’s project in our <code>hooks/</code> folder. </p><h4 id="the-useinterval-hook">The useInterval Hook</h4><p><code>useInterval.js</code></p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/6bb0379278471006e25a860d99261ad3/e5c06/c7c61f06e1e349e693d757f736bea88f.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/6bb0379278471006e25a860d99261ad3/e5c06/c7c61f06e1e349e693d757f736bea88f.png 826w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" alt="custom-interval-hook">
<em>The code for the custom useInterval Hook, just as Dan Abramov wrote it.</em></p><p>This <code>useInterval</code> Hook sets up an interval and clears it after the component unmounts. It’s a combo of <code>setInterval()</code> and <code>clearInterval()</code>, but all wrapped into one easy-to-implement Hook.</p><p>All you need to do to get the Hook to work is supply it a function (the <code>callback</code> parameter) and an interval time (the <code>delay</code>). Simple!</p><p>With this Hook, more than half the battle is already over, now you’re ready to drop this interval Hook wherever you need it in your code. For me and my team, that happened to be in the reports page.</p><h4 id="putting-useinterval-to-use">Putting useInterval to Use</h4><p><code>ReportsPage.js</code></p><p>Here’s a condensed version of my <code>ReportsPage</code> functional component with the <code>useInterval</code> Hook imported at the top of the component and dropped into the code.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/e5942f330c84e075c8c9e908880748c9/c701c/639e6f862e4240f99d37ada6247c6b7d.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/e5942f330c84e075c8c9e908880748c9/c701c/639e6f862e4240f99d37ada6247c6b7d.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" alt="useInterval-hook-encapsulates-interval-logic">
<em>Instead of managing multiple component lifecycles, the useInterval hook encapsulates all the interval logic into itself, making it easy to reuse in many places in the code.</em></p><p>In my component, the <code>useInterval</code> Hook takes in an asynchronous call to fetch any reports that have been generated the by the report service (<code>reportService.getGeneratedReports()</code>), and then it updates the reports available for download in the UI with <code>setReports()</code>.</p><p>For ease-of-updating the interval timing if need be, I’m using a constant called <code>REPORT_REFRESH_INTERVAL</code>, which is set to run this polling interval every 15 seconds while the component is mounted.</p><p>I added the <code>console.log</code> so it’s easier to tell if the interval is running correctly.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/bf083fe2c578ff404a0eafced6e6d625/70ccf/c88df671416244f3b56c8ae23ae8cfad.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/bf083fe2c578ff404a0eafced6e6d625/70ccf/c88df671416244f3b56c8ae23ae8cfad.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" alt="confirms-running-on-an-interval">
<em>Inelegant? Maybe. Confirms it’s running on an interval? Sure does.</em></p><p>The count of 11 ahead of the logged message <code>"Checking if reports are ready to download"</code> demonstrates that the <code>useInterval</code> Hook is firing at regular intervals while users are on the Report page. If you checked the Network panel right now in the Developer Tools, you’d also see 11 individual API calls to the <code>reportService</code>’s <code>getGeneratedReports()</code> REST endpoint.</p><p>Once the user navigates to a different page or component, you’ll see the API calls cease with no extra code on my part. Only if the user returns to the Reports page will the polling for reports resume.</p><p>How simple is that? Instead of having to write multiple instances of <code>setInterval()</code>, <code>clearInterval()</code> inside of your class-based components’ lifecycles when you need intervals, you can have one <code>useInterval</code> Hook that can drop into any functional component anywhere in the app that you need polling.</p><p>Now that’s how you poll efficiently with a custom React Hook. And you could use this very same Hook anywhere in your code that an interval is needed.</p><hr><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Sometimes you need a simple way to check if an asynchronous task being performed by a separate service is done or not. Polling is one way to do this; hitting an endpoint over and over at some set interval to check for fresh data to display in the UI.</p><p>With the introduction of React Hooks, and especially the ability to put together custom Hooks, creating a reusable Hook called <code>useInterval</code> to serve just such a purpose seemed inevitable. Dan Abramov, part of the React core team, obliged, and the real beauty of it is, this Hook is highly reusable.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- s9ymdb:496 --><p><img width="300" height="303" src="https://blog.hboeck.de/uploads/bluebutton.jpg" alt="Blue Button">BigBlueButton is a free web-based video conferencing software that lately got quite popular, largely due to Covid-19. Earlier this year I did a brief check on its security which led to an <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/big-blue-button-das-grosse-blaue-sicherheitsrisiko-2010-151610.html">article on Golem.de (German)</a>. I want to share the most significant findings here.</p><p>

BigBlueButton has a feature that lets a presenter upload a presentation in a wide variety of file formats that gets then displayed in the web application. This looked like a huge attack surface. The conversion for many file formats is done with Libreoffice on the server. Looking for ways to exploit server-side Libreoffice rendering I found a <a href="https://buer.haus/2019/10/18/a-tale-of-exploitation-in-spreadsheet-file-conversions/">blog post by Bret Buerhaus</a> that discussed a number of ways of exploiting such setups.</p><p>

One of the methods described there is a feature in Opendocument Text (ODT) files that allows embedding a file from an external URL in a text section. This can be a web URL like https or a file url and include a local file.</p><p>

This directly worked in BigBlueButton. An ODT file that referenced a local file would display that local file. This allows displaying any file that the user running the BigBlueButton service could access on the server. A possible way to exploit this is to exfiltrate the configuration file that contains the API secret key, which then allows basically controlling the BigBlueButton instance. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op2hc2Z56a8">video showing the exploit here</a>. (I will publish the exploit later.)</p><p>

I reported this to the developers of BigBlueButton in May. Unfortunately my experience with their security process was not very good. At first I did not get an answer at all. After another mail they told me they plan to sandbox the Libreoffice process either via a chroot or a docker container. However that still has not happened yet. It is planned for the upcoming version 2.3 and independent of this bug this is a good idea, as Libreoffice just creates a lot of attack surface.</p><p>

Recently I looked a bit more into this.  The functionality to include external files only happens after a manual user confirmation and if one uses Libreoffice on the command line it does not work at all by default. So in theory this exploit should not have worked, but it did.</p><p>

It turned out the reason for this was another piece of software that BigBlueButton uses called <a herf="https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter">JODConverter</a>. It provides a wrapper around the conversion functionality of Libreoffice. After contacting both the Libreoffice security team and the developer of JODConverter we figured out that it enables including external URLs by default.</p><p>

I forwarded this information to the BigBlueButton developers and it finally let to a fix, they now change the default settings of JODConverter manually. The JODConverter developer considers changing the default as well, but this has not happened yet. Other software or web pages using JODConverter for serverside file conversion may thus still be vulnerable.</p><p>

The fix was included in version 2.2.27. Today I learned that the company RedTeam Pentesting <a href="https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2020-005/-arbitrary-file-disclosure-and-server-side-request-forgery-in-bigbluebutton">has later independently found the same vulnerability</a>. They also requested a CVE: It is now filed as CVE-2020-25820.</p><p>

While this issue is fixed, the handling of security issues by BigBlueButton was not exactly stellar. It took around five months from my initial report to a fix. The <a href="https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.2.27">release notes</a> do not mention that this is an important security update (the change has the note “speed up the conversion”).</p><p>

I found a bunch of other security issues in BigBlueButton and proposed some hardening changes. This took a lot of back and forth, but all significant issues are resolved now.</p><p>

Another issue with the presentation upload was that it allowed cross site scripting, because it did not set a proper content type for downloads. This was independently discovered by another person and was fixed a while ago. (If you are interested in details about this class of vulnerabilities: I have given <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t8JYpt0egE">a talk about it at last year’s Security Fest</a>.)</p><p>

The session Cookies both from BigBlueButton itself and from its default web frontend Greenlight were not set with a secure flag, so the cookies could be transmitted in clear text over the network. This has also been changed now.</p><p>

By default the BigBlueButton installation script starts several services that open ports that do not need to be publicly accessible. This is now also changed. A freeswitch service run locally was installed with a default password (“ClueCon”), this is now also changed to a random password by the installation script.</p><p>

What also looks quite problematic is the use of outdated software. BigBlueButton only works on Ubuntu 16.04, which is a long term support version, so it still receives updates. But it also uses several external repositories, including one that installs NodeJS version 8 and shows a warning that this repository no longer receives security updates. There is an <a href="https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/issues/109">open bug in the bug tracker</a>.</p><p>

If you are using BigBlueButton I strongly recommend you update to at least version 2.2.27. This should fix all the issues I found. I would wish that the BigBlueButton developers improve their security process, react more timely to external reports and more transparent when issues are fixed.</p><p>

      <p>A look at how LinkedIn exfiltrates browser extension data from your browser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>How would you feel if you opened a program and the program started to check your file system to see what other programs you
      had installed? You would probably feel the software was overstepping. This is essentially what LinkedIn does when you visit their
      website. LinkedIn will scan your local browser files in an attempt to identify a number of different browser extensions you may
      have installed. The data collected by LinkedIn is then exfiltrated from the browser.</p>
      <p>
        This whole adventure started when I was browsing LinkedIn and happened to have my browser console open. While on my LinkedIn
        profile I noticed a large number of 404 errors and as a developer it piqued my interest.
        <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/spying-xs.gif" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
          <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/spying-xs.gif" alt="LinkedIn's website making local host web requests.">
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>What really piqued my curiosity was the fact all of these failed web requests were for <strong>chrome-extension://</strong>
      resources. After inspecting a few of the extension IDs in the resources I began to suspect LinkedIn was attempting to determine
      if I had certain extensions installed by executing local web requests to the browser itself.</p>
      <p>I spent some time toying around with my browser and LinkedIn's assets. Note, reverse engineering LinkedIn's source code is
      apparently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#dos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against their terms of service</a>. If I was
      LinkedIn I would probably not want people figuring out how I spy on them either.</p>
      <p>After poking around and doing some investigation I found an interesting object in one of LinkedIn's local storage values.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>

      <p>One of LinkedIn's local storage keys is <strong>C_C_M</strong>. The value itself is a base64 encoded string (which isn't too
      abnormal). However, if you decode the string you will see a large JSON blob that seems to be encoded with unicode code points (not
      human readable).</p>
      <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/unicode-resized.png" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
        <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/unicode-resized.png" alt="LinkedIn's local storage printed to a browser console encoded with unicode.">
      </a>
      <p>I am not too sure how or why they encoded it that way, but it seems to me like it was in an attempt to obfuscate the data. The
      encoding is easy enough to reverse, simply parse the JSON. You can do it yourself with the following snippet:</p>
      <p><code>JSON.parse(atob(localStorage.getItem("C_C_M")));</code></p>
      <p>Doing so will display a large JavaScript object with some interesting data in it. Note, it appears the data held in this JSON
      blob is personalized to some degree. In other words, my JSON blob may be larger or smaller than yours. I am unsure which heuristic
      LinkedIn uses to determine which extensions to scan for but they must be using some. Curious what the complete JSON object looks
      like? <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/files/linkedin-extension.json" target="_blank">Here's mine</a>.</p>
      <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/localstorage.png" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
        <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/localstorage.png" alt="LinkedIn's local storage printed to the console as a javascript object.">
      </a>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>After examing the JSON file it became pretty clear what was going on. LinkedIn is using two different methods to determine if
      you have an extension installed.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Content Changed</li>
        <li>Web Accessible Resources</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first method is the simplest. LinkedIn simply looks for certain content on the page they know doesn't belong there. For
      instance, if they find a div with the ID <strong>email-hunter</strong>, they know you have the Email Hunter extension installed
      (and now your account is probably restricted, or at least on a blacklist).</p>
      <p>The second method is a lot more interesting to me. When building an extension you can specify web accessible resources. These
      resources are typically used via a content script to build a custom interface. However, there's a bit of a gotcha. If the content
      script can make a request for the web accessible resource, so can the underlying website. LinkedIn abuses this fact and sprays
      web requests to your local browser in attempt to find extensions.</p>
      <p>I built a simple extension to automatically parse the extension file and display extensions LinkedIn is looking for.
        <a href="https://code.prophitt.me/corey/nefarious-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out here</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>So, as a developer of an extension what can you do about this? I recommend not using
      <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/web_accessible_resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web accessible resources</a>. Out
      of all extensions LinkedIn finds, a majority of them are due to web accessible resources.</p>
      <p>I would recommend not modifying or injecting user interface features into the underlying page. Alternatively, I would use a
      browser action and communicate with the content page through messaging passing.</p>

<![CDATA[A Visual Guide to Regular Expression]]>
            </title>

October 21, 2020 | https://amitness.com/regex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/regex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s a common task in NLP to either check a text against a pattern or extract parts from the text that matches a certain pattern. A regular expression or “regex” is a powerful tool to achieve this.</p>
<p>While powerful, regex can feel daunting as it comes with a lot of features and sub-parts that you need to remember.</p>
<p>In this post, I will illustrate the various concepts underlying regex. The goal is to help you build a good mental model of how a regex pattern works.</p>
<h2 id="mental-model">Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example where we are trying to find the word ‘cool’ in the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-mental-model-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With regex, we could simply type out the word ‘cool’ as the pattern and it will match the word.</p>

<p>While regex matched our desired word ‘<strong>cool</strong>’, the way it operates is not at the word level but the character level. This is the key idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Regex works at the character-level, not word-level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The implication of this is that the regex <code>r'cool'</code> would match the following sentences as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-exact-word-match.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key idea, let’s understand how we can match simple characters using regex.</p>
<h3 id="a-specific-character">a. Specific character</h3>
<p>We can simply specify the character in the regular expression and it will match all instances in the text.</p>
<p>For example, a regular expression given below will match all instances of ‘a’ in the text. You can use any of the small and capital alphabets.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-only-a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use any digits from 0 to 9 and it will work as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-python-3.7-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that regex is case-sensitive by default and thus the following regex won’t match anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-not-matched-by-capital-a.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-white-space-character">b. White space character</h3>
<p>We can detect special characters such as whitespace and newlines using special escape sequences.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-white-space-characters.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common ones above, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>\r</strong> for carriage return</li>
<li><strong>\f</strong> for form feed</li>
<li><strong>\e</strong> for escape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-special-sequences">c. Special sequences</h3>
<p>Regex provides a bunch of built-in special symbols that can match a group of characters at once. These begin with backslash <code>\</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pattern-d">Pattern: <code>\d</code></h4>
<p>It matches any single-digit number between 0 to 9.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-single-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that matches are single digit. So we have 4 different matches below instead of a single number <code>18.04</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-ubuntu-18.04.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-s">Pattern: \s</h4>
<p>It matches any whitespace character (<span>space</span>, <span>tab</span> or <span>newline</span>).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-any-whitespace.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-w">Pattern: \w</h4>
<p>It matches any of the small alphabets(a to z), capital alphabets(A to Z), digits (0 to 9), and underscore.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-w.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-">Pattern: .</h4>
<p>It matches any character except the new line (\n).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-everything-except-newline.png" alt=""></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'line 1</span><span>\n</span><span>line2'</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'2'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="pattern-negations">Pattern: Negations</h4>
<p>If you use the capitalized versions of the patterns above, they act as negation.</p>
<p>For example, if “\d” matched any digits from 0 to 9, then “\D” will match anything except “0 to 9”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-negation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="d-character-sets">d. Character sets</h3>
<p>These are patterns starting with <code>[</code> and ending with <code>]</code> and specify the characters that should be matched enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>For example, the following pattern matches any of the characters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-aeiou.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also replicate the functionality of <code>\d</code> using the below pattern. It will match any digits between 0 to 9.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-1-to-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of specifying all the digits, we can use <code>-</code> to specify only start and end digits. So, instead of <code>[0123456789]</code>, we can do:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-refactor-all-digits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, <code>[2-4]</code> can be used to match any digits between 2 to 4 i.e. (2 or 3 or 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-year-2014-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can even use the special characters we learned previously inside the brackets. For example, you can match any digit from 0 to 9 or whitespace as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-whitespace-or-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below, I have listed some useful common patterns and what they mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-common-pattern-for-bracket.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="e-anchors">e. Anchors</h3>
<p>Regex also has special handlers to make the pattern only match if it’s at the start or end of the string.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>^</code> anchor to match patterns only at the start of a line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-start-anchor.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>$</code> anchor after the character to match patterns only if it’s the end of the line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-anchor-end.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="f-escaping-metacharacters">f. Escaping metacharacters</h3>
<p>Consider a case where we want to exactly match the word “Mr. Stark”.</p>
<p>If we write a regex like <code>Mr. Stark</code>, then it will have an unintended effect. Since we know dot has a special meaning in a regex.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-issue.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we should always escape the special metacharacters like <code>.</code>, <code>$</code> etc. if our goal is to match the exact character itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-fixed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the list of metacharacters that you should remember to escape if you’re using them directly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>^ $ . * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="repetition-of-basic-blocks">Repetition of basic blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we can pattern match any characters, we could repeat things and start building more complicated patterns.</p>
<h3 id="a-naive-repetition">a. Naive repetition</h3>
<p>Using only what we have learned so far, a naive way would be to just repeat the pattern. For example, we can match two-digit numbers by just repeating the character-level pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-d-slash-d.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-quantifiers">b. Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Regex provides special quantifiers to specify different types of repetition for the character preceding it.</p>
<h4 id="i-fixed-repetition">i. Fixed repetition</h4>
<p>We can use the <code>{...}</code> quantifier to specify the number of times a pattern should repeat.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-manual-counts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the previous pattern for matching 2-digit number can be recreated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-it-is-2020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also specify a range of repetitions using the same quantifier. For example, to match from 2-digit to 4-digit numbers, we could use the pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-min-max-count.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When applied to a sentence, it will match both 4-digit and 2-digit numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-20-years-old.png" alt=""></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>
There should not be any space between minimum and maximum count For example, \d{2, 4} doesn't work.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="ii-flexible-quantifiers">ii. Flexible quantifiers</h4>
<p>Regex also provides quantifiers “*”, “+” and “?” using which you can specify flexible repetition of a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>0 or 1 times</strong>: <code>?</code><br>
The <code>?</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 0 or 1 times. This can be useful to make certain parts optional.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-clarify.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to match both the word “sound” and “sound” where “s” is optional. Then, we can use the <code>?</code> quantifier that matches if a character repeats 0 or 1 times.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-example.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>one or more times</strong>: <code>+</code><br>
The <code>+</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 1 or more times.</p>
<p>For example, we could find numbers of any arbitrary length using the regex <code>\d+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-example-of-plus.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zero or more times</strong>: <code>*</code><br>
The <code>*</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats zero or more times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-in-python">Usage in Python</h2>
<p>Python provides a module called “re” in the standard library to work with regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-raw-strings">Need for raw strings</h3>
<p>To specify a regular expression in Python, we precede it with <strong>r</strong> to create raw strings.</p>

<p>To understand why we precede with <strong>r</strong>, let’s try printing the expression <strong>\t</strong> without <code>**r**</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see how when we don’t use raw string, the string <code>\t</code> is treated as the escape character for tab by Python.</p>
<p>Now let’s convert it into raw string. We get back whatever we specified.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>r'\t'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>
\<span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="using-re-module">Using re module</h3>
<p>To use <code>re</code> module, we can start by importing the <code>re</code> module as:</p>

<h4 id="1-refindall">1. re.findall</h4>
<p>This function allows us to get all the matches as a list of strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'\d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123456'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="2-rematch">2. re.match</h4>
<p>This function searches for a pattern at the beginning of the string and returns the first occurrence as a match object. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='batman'&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-object.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the match object, we can get the matched text as</p>


<p>In a case where our pattern is not at the start of the sentence, we will not get any match.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'The batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="3-research">3. re.search</h4>
<p>This function also finds the first occurrence of a pattern but the pattern can occur anywhere in the text. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'the batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>.</span><span>group</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic stuff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes users often rely on the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and cluster autoscaling to scale applications. We show how using Red Sky Ops to optimize the whole application alongside the HPA improves cost and performance using the example of a web-application.</p>





<h2><strong>What is the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler?</strong></h2>





<p>The<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> (HPA) in Kubernetes scales up and down the number of replicas in a deployment or a stateful set based on metrics prescribed by the user. The most common metrics are CPU and memory utilization of the target pods.&nbsp;</p>





<p>To deploy the HPA, the user sets target metrics for all replicas in a deployment as well as the minimum and maximum number of replicas. The HPA is responsible for adding or deleting replicas to keep the observed metrics lower than the target values while keeping the number of replicas within the prescribed bounds.</p>





<p>When scaling based on CPU and memory utilization, HPA uses the metrics.k8s.io API implemented by the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metrics-server</a>. The HPA can also use<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/custom-metrics-api.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> custom metrics</a> or external metrics (e.g. number of requests per second on the ingress) implemented by a third-party or the user.</p>





<h2><strong>HPA tuning challenges</strong></h2>





<p>Optimizing the target metrics of the HPA for all applications and their specific workloads can be frustrating. While newer versions of kubernetes support more in depth configuration of the HPA through policies<a href="#note">*</a>, many users are left with a minimal set of configuration options: namely a cpu/memory utilization target and the maximum number of replicas.</p>





<p>If the application is a web server for example, the speed at which the HPA adds replicas is critical to accommodate bursts in traffic. A simple fix would be to reduce the CPU utilization target to a small value (say 15%) so that the HPA adds replicas early on when the traffic increases. However, this increases your cloud cost because many replicas are underutilized. To limit the cost, one could use replicas with a high CPU utilization target. If the traffic increases, while the HPA is creating replicas waiting to be available, the current replicas experience CPU throttling and the HTTP request latency increases, impacting the clients experience.</p>





<p>A ML-powered experimentation engine such as <a href="https://github.com/redskyops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Sky Ops</a> can be used to design a highly available, scalable and cost-efficient application. Let’s demonstrate this using an example web application.</p>





<h2><strong>Example web application</strong></h2>





<p>In the following example, we will optimize the <a href="https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker example voting app</a> using Red Sky Ops. This app is a simple distributed application that allows the user to vote between two options – cats or dogs.</p>





<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FbR98IC_2s4U7qpocG4wyH_iAWd8k9aAwai5OTLYvDezvic2HrNZLbqfI-9ABGgoR6RPJxESclSW5oYGyF3m-s6tfS3ByaensHUNlUIMLaIJ69-znggPRpL2WAYxHX4fkGYAlUQ" alt=""></figure>





<p>A Redis queue collects the votes. Workers consume the votes and insert them in a postgres database. Finally there is a node.js webapp that shows the results of the voting in real time. You can deploy this application in a dedicated namespace with:</p>





<pre>kustomize build github.com/redskyops/redskyops-recipes/voting-webapp/application | kubectl apply -f -</pre>





<h2><strong>Red Sky Ops experiments</strong></h2>





<p>An “experiment” is made of multiple trials whereby the Red Sky Ops server patches the whole application to find the optimal configuration. For each trial, the application is tested using a scalability test. At the end of each test, the Red Sky Ops controller measures metrics to optimize for. In this experiment, we will optimize for two metrics of opposite goals: cost of running the application (in $/month) and p95 latency (in ms). While the performance increases with resources, cost becomes problematic. On the other hand, starving an application reduces user experience. Machine learning helps finding the best tradeoff. You can find detailed instructions to run the experiment yourself <a href="https://github.com/redskyops/redskyops-recipes/tree/master/hpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> with Locust.</p>





<p>We are using the HPA to scale up and down the number of replicas of the front-end deployment responsible for the user experience. For simplicity, we will tune HPA using a target utilization available via the metrics server. The parameters that we are optimizing are the minimum and maximum number of replicas, target utilization used by the HPA and CPU requests for the voting-service pod. Note that every pod runs with a guaranteed QoS (limits=requests).</p>





<p>We run the experiment for 400 trials, and consider a trial as failed if the response latency is greater than one second.</p>





<h2><strong>Scalability test</strong></h2>





<p>During each trial we load test the application with increasing requests per second (RPS): 100 RPS for one minute, 500 RPS for one minute, 1000 RPS for one minute, 2000 for one minute. This allows us to test the scalability of the application and make sure that the HPA is configured correctly. The application should be able to minimize the cost for a low level of traffic (100 RPS) but still able to scale up fast enough to 2000 RPS.</p>





<h2><strong>Experiment results</strong></h2>





<p>We first set a baseline configuration with:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=3<br>Maximum replicas=7<br>CPU utilization target=65%<br>CPU per replica=2&nbsp;</pre>





<p>In this case the cost is $481/month to run this application for a p95 latency of 579 milliseconds.</p>





<p>Each dot represents the metric values measured at the end of each trial (<a href="#figure-1">see Figure 1</a>). The red dots are the best trials found during the experiment, i.e. there is no better configuration for one metric without increasing the value of the other metric. After some exploration of the parameter space, the algorithm converges towards optimal configurations. We find a sharp transition in latency around a cost of $330 per month, where the most satisfying performance is achieved. We find that the best application is obtained for:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=10<br>Maximum replicas=15<br>CPU utilization target=80%<br>CPU per replica=0.855</pre>





<p>The cost of running this application is $365/month (24% savings) while the latency is 27.8 milliseconds (95% increase in performance). The advantage of providing multiple best configurations is the ability for the user to pick based on experience. For example, if an experienced devops engineer wants a more scalable application in case of larger spikes of traffic than the ones created for the load test, the following configuration can be chosen:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=3<br>Maximum replicas=9<br>CPU utilization target=10%<br>CPU per replica=0.849</pre>





<p>The cost is $344/month (28% savings) while the latency is 60 milliseconds (89% increase in performance). Because the CPU utilization target per replica is lower in this case, a sudden burst in traffic triggers a scale up from the HPA early allowing for the newly added replicas to be available.</p>

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>





<p>Using Red Sky Ops, we can deploy a web application using the HPA that efficiently scales and avoids over provisioning for spikes in traffic.</p>





<p>We decided to tune the CPU target utilization of the HPA. This is more of an infrastructure monitoring approach that is made available quite easily by the metrics server. A different approach would have been to tune the HPA based on the number of requests-per-second on the ingress. Check out this great<a href="https://medium.com/uptime-99/kubernetes-hpa-autoscaling-with-custom-and-external-metrics-da7f41ff7846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> blog post</a> on how to set up the external metrics server to work with the HPA.</p>





<p>Like the<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> USE</a> and <a href="https://www.weave.works/blog/the-red-method-key-metrics-for-microservices-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RED</a> methods for monitoring your infrastructure and user experience, the Red Sky Ops experiments can be written to optimize both of your infrastructure cost and usage and/or user experience on your deployed application.</p>





<p>Finally, Red Sky Ops allows you to efficiently find the optimal configurations when the correlations are<a href="https://www.carbonrelay.com/blog/the-new-basics-of-configuration-management-in-kubernetes/"> too complicated for a human to understand</a>. For this example, we have oversimplified the application to easily interpret the results, but in production one would tune the resources of all the deployments.</p>





<p>To try it for yourself, create a free Red Sky Ops account.</p>

<hr>





<p id="note"><strong>*Note:</strong> For v1.18+ the HPA API will allow the scaling behavior to be configurable, allowing the user to design the scale up and scale down policies.</p>





<p><code><code>scaleDown: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- type: Percent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value: 100<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periodSeconds: 15<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;scaleUp:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stabilizationWindowSeconds: 0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- type: Percent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value: 100<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periodSeconds: 15<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- type: Pods<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value: 4<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periodSeconds: 15<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selectPolicy: Max</code></code></p>








<p>In order to check if your kubernetes cluster has the behavior field available run:</p>









<pre>kubectl explain --api-version=autoscaling/v2beta2 hpa.spec.metrics</pre>

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
― Arthur C. Clarke, Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever since Raspberry Pi came into my world, I have been exploring better ways to interact with it. Take Kodi the media player for example - yes, keyboard and mouse are fine; yes, the native web interface is super powerful; and yes, you can even use your TV remote directly if it’s HDMI-CEC-compatible. But there’s something about Raspberry Pi’s small form factor (and perhaps its open source spirit) that just makes me wish for a hands-free experience.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like my Google Home Mini/Google Assistant to pick up my voice command, send it over to the Raspberry Pi and make it to do something useful. To my great surprise, there doesn’t seem to be a satisfactory end-to-end solution anywhere that suits my need. However, that’s about to change - please join me in my quest to build a voice-controlled Raspberry Pi. Before we dive into the technical mumbo jumbo, here is a quick rundown of all the hardware/software we need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/adnanh/webhook">Webhook</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">Port forwarding</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/">FreeDNS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> (or any voice assistant that IFTTT supports for that matter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay Google, pause Kodi and let’s get started.</p>


<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the name, Kodi is an all-in-one solution for media consumption. For starter, it integrates almost every video streaming service on earth into a unified interface, be it YouTube, Netflix or even Google Drive. In addition to its core functionalities as a media player, Kodi supports extensions that can do much more through the installation of add-ons. Did I mention that it has a lovely weather widget?</p>

<p>Kodi also shines in the input department. On top of the keyboard/mouse, web interface or TV remote option, the <code>kodi-send</code> command lets user control the player via command line. For example, if we are interested in replicating the effect of pressing the play button, we only need to need to run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kodi-send <span>--action</span><span>=</span><span>"PlayerControl(play)"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To wrap it in a shell, let’s create the following script <code>/usr/local/bin/pictrl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
<span>action</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$action</span><span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"play"</span> <span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$action</span><span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"pause"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then
  </span>kodi-send <span>--action</span><span>=</span><span>"PlayerControl(play)"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it’s ready to roll. Since play and pause are basically the same command in different contexts, we also get the pause function for free.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use <code>pictrl play</code> in the command line interface (or over SSH) to play (or pasue) the video on your Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="webhook---listening-and-responding-to-a-web-request">Webhook - Listening and Responding to a Web Request</h2>

<p>Next up we are going to trigger that <code>pictrl</code> script with an http request. For that, we will use webhook, a cool piece of technology that enables responding to http requests with custom callbacks.</p>

<p>To enable webhook, first create the configuration file <code>/etc/webhook.conf</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"pictrl"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"execute-command"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/usr/local/bin/pictrl"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"command-working-directory"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/home/pi/"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"pass-arguments-to-command"</span><span>:</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"query"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"action"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>that points a new webhook instance to the <code>pictrl</code> command. After that, the webhook can be started as a service using:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl start webhook
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or auto-started upon startup by running:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>webhook
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that for such a service that is intended to be accessible over the internet (as will become true in the next step), it’s probably a good idea to authenticate the identity of the requestor in some form. For example, you can ask the requestor to submit a token that only a trusted user knows along with the request itself.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://localipaddress:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device within the same network to control your Kodi player.</p>

<h2 id="port-forwarding---exposing-local-service-to-the-public">Port Forwarding - Exposing Local Service to the Public</h2>

<p>A local IP address, by definition, isn’t visible outside the local network. To fix the problem, it’s generally required to log on to your modem/router as admin and configure what’s known as port forwarding. From then on, instead of using <code>http://localipaddress:port</code> locally, we can call <code>http://publicipaddress:port</code> over the internet and the request will be directed to the same place.</p>

<p>In case you don’t have admin control over your modem (which is unfortunately true in my case), <a href="https://webhookrelay.com/">Webhook Relay</a> can be helpful although its free tier only supports up to 150 “relays” per month. Another service called <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> can be equally effective, with the catch being no permanent subdomain support for the free tier users. Other solutions include a dedicated VPN/VPS that allows for port forwarding. You see, they all cost money if you want the optimal experience.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://publicipaddress:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device that’s connected to the internet to control your video player.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-dns---your-raspberry-pis-permanent-domain-name">Dynamic DNS - Your Raspberry Pi’s Permanent Domain Name</h2>

<p>For most internet users at home, chances are that their public IP addresses aren’t static. With each reboot of the modem, a new address will be assigned by the ISP which makes it annoying if you are looking for a more permanent solution. Don’t worry - dynamic DNS services such as FreeDNS can come to the rescue. These services essentially maintain a list that maps the domain (or subdomain) names to their corresponding IP addresses, and each user tells them to update the list whenever the IP address changes. To automate this, run the following command at Raspberry Pi’s startup:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>wget https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?[yourtokenhere]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If all goes well, instead of changing <code>http://publicipaddress</code> each time the modem restarts, a new and permanent name <code>http://domainname</code> is all we have to remember.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://domainname:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device on the internet to control your video player.</p>

<h2 id="ifttt---connecting-to-a-voice-assistant">IFTTT - Connecting to A Voice Assistant</h2>

<p>IFTTT, short for “If This Then That”, provides a convenient way to create a hub that connects a variety of services (including voice assistants) where they can interact with each another based on a set of user-defined rules (called applets). At the time of writing, IFTTT allows each user to create up to 3 applets for its free tier. As the name implies, every applet follows the “If This Then That” structure:</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/1.jpg">
</p>

<p>and creating a new applet boils down to defining the two pieces: the “If This” and the “Then That”.</p>

<p>So let’s configure the “If This” first by selecting the Google Assistant option (you might be asked to link your Google account to IFTTT). In the next screen, although the “Say a simple phrase” option is more than enough to get the job done, the “Say a phrase with a text ingredient” option is preferred as it will be a lot more flexible when it comes to further customizing our voice commands.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/3.jpg">
</p>

<p>That brings us to the trigger configuration. Personally, I use “kodi” as my keyword, followed by a custom text field. The rest is not important.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/4.jpg">
</p>

<p>Next, onto the “Then That” piece, what we want to choose is the webhook service that we created in the previous step, with the exact action being configurable for future development’s sake:</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/6.jpg">
</p>

<p>Save and continue. That’s it - our first IFTTT applet has just become fully operational.</p>

<p><strong>Final milestone</strong>: now you can say the following magic words to play (or pause) the video on your Raspberry Pi’s Kodi player:</p>



<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>

<p><img src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/logo2.png">
</p>

<p>As you might have noticed by now, your voice can be literally as powerful as your computer is. The toolchain we’ve explored so far makes it possible to invoke almost any action of our choice with almost any words of our choice. What’s more, any additional development will only need to happen locally inside the <code>pictrl</code> dispatcher, so it’s easily scalable if we want our Raspberry Pi to learn a new trick. Last but not least, what to do with such limitless possibility might be a matter of user experience at the end of the day, so please let me know what your mileage turns out to be.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h3 id="install-all-the-software-packages-mentioned-above">Install all the software packages mentioned above</h3>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>kodi
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>kodi-eventclients-kodi-send
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>webhook
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Update Oct 22, 2020: Included discussion on other solutions when port forwarding is not an option. Thanks to Mike Foden (@mikefoden) for bringing up ngrok.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>One of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, LUMI, will start its operations in CSC’s data center in Kajaani, Finland, next year. The peak performance of LUMI is an astonishing 552 petaflop/s. To date, the world’s fastest computer, Fugaku in Japan, reaches peak performance of 513 petaflop/s. When LUMI’s operations start next year, it will be one of the world’s fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>LUMI is a unique European endeavor, with ten European countries and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) investing in one joint system. It is set to boost research, employment, and competitiveness throughout Europe. The procurement process of LUMI is now complete, and the system supplier is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), providing an HPE Cray EX supercomputer with next generation AMD EPYC™ CPUs and AMD Instinct™ GPUs. In addition to the remarkable computing power, LUMI is also one of the world’s most advanced platforms for artificial intelligence and it will be one of the world’s best known scientific instruments throughout its lifetime.</p>
<p>– Today we mark an important step forward in the realisation of the European High-Performance Computing strategy. The pre-exascale supercomputer hosted by the LUMI consortium will be among the top 5 in the world. Together with the other EuroHPC pre-exascale and petascale supercomputers that will be deployed in 2021, the LUMI supercomputer will help Europe’s public and private users address many daunting research and innovation problems across different areas from weather and climate change through cybersecurity to drug discovery and personalised medicine. LUMI supercomputer aligns the Digital and Green Deal policies of the European Commission, using 100% renewable carbon neutral energy. Moreover, the heat generated will provide 20 percent of the district heat of the area, being one of the most efficient supercomputers in the world, says <strong>Khalil Rouhana</strong>, Deputy Director-General of the Directorate‑General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) of the European Commission.</p>
<p>– Once operational in mid-2021, the LUMI supercomputer will be one of the most competitive and green supercomputers in the world! Such a leadership-class system will support European researchers, industry, and public sector, in better understanding and responding to complex challenges and transforming them into innovation opportunities in sectors like health, weather forecasting, or urban and rural planning, says the Executive Director of EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, <strong>Anders Dam Jensen</strong>.</p>
<p>– We are committed to supporting the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) to seize opportunities in next-generation supercomputing and bolster R&amp;D in science, advance innovation, and unlock economic growth. We are honored to continue collaborating with EuroHPC JU, and through our partnership with AMD, build one of the world’s fastest pre-exascale supercomputers for Europe.”, says <strong>Peter Ungaro</strong>, senior vice president, and general manager, high-performance computing (HPC) and mission critical solutions (MCS), HPE.</p>
<p>– The reliability of CSC and Finland made the European Commission and ten partner countries to invest in one pan-European high-performance computing and data management infrastructure in Finland. We have to keep up the excellent collaboration in order to maximize this investment to benefit society on a larger scale, says Permanent Secretary <strong>Anita Lehikoinen</strong> from Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland</p>
<p>LUMI is an investment of over 200 million euros, covering the whole lifecycle of the system. It will lift Europe to the forefront of high performance computing (HPC) and research. Exploiting the potential of the data economy is crucial for Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>– The investment will make CSC data center one of the world’s largest players in the field of HPC. The joint procurement process with the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and ten European countries has proceeded on schedule despite the global pandemic, thanks to the vast know-how of the LUMI consortium and the excellent collaboration. LUMI’s astonishing computing power combined with a highly modern artificial intelligence platform and data management infrastructure will help European researchers tackle unforeseen research challenges, says CSC’s Managing Director <strong>Kimmo Koski</strong>.</p>
<p>The uptake of HPC will remarkably increase the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe remarkably. Up to one-fifth of LUMI’s resources will be available for industry and SMEs.</p>
<p>– The technology we are using is strongly based on mathematical modelling: analyses, artificial intelligence, simulations, and optimization. Therefore, powerful computing capacity and data management infrastructure are of the utmost importance for us. The LUMI infrastructure will open up entirely new possibilities for us, which we may exploit, says Anna-Maria Henell, CEO of Disior Ltd. Disior is a Finnish company developing software for analysing medical images in 3D.</p>

<p><strong>Supercomputers enable the fight against pandemics and help resolve unforeseen research questions<br>
</strong>LUMI’s top-notch computing resources are needed in leading-edge research in a wide range of data- and computing-intensive fields. Examples include climate, pharmaceutical, and artificial intelligence.<br>
LUMI will also have a fast-track for urgent computing in time- and mission-critical simulations. This kind of simulation might be, for example, related to a large epidemic or pandemic disease. The current COVID-19 pandemic has largely benefitted from supercomputers: supercomputers have been used for example to simulate studies related to vaccine research and defeat the spread of the virus. With its vast computing resources, LUMI can address different research challenges even faster than before. In addition, it will enable addressing totally new types of scientific challenges combining multidisciplinary research and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>World-class environmental sustainability and energy-efficiency</strong><br>
As a carbon-neutral data center, LUMI helps the European ICT sector in becoming greener and more cost-efficient, which is a necessity for reaching EU’s ambitious climate targets and paving the way for the green transition. CSC’s data center in Kajaani is among the world’s most eco-efficient: it uses 100% renewable energy produced with hydropower. LUMI’s waste heat will be used in Kajaani’s district heating network: 20% of the area’s yearly district heating needs will be covered with LUMI’s waste heat.</p>
<p><strong>LUMI system architecture explained:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The LUMI system will be supplied by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), based on an HPE Cray EX supercomputer.</li>
<li>The peak performance of LUMI is an astonishing 552 petaflop/s meaning 552 *10<sup>15</sup> floating point operations per second. This figure makes LUMI one of the world’s fastest supercomputers. For comparison, the world’s fastest computer today (Fugaku in Japan) reaches 513 petaflop/s and the second fastest (Summit in the US) 200 petaflop/s (more information: <a href="http://www.top500.org/">www.top500.org</a>). If LUMI’s computing power was compared to normal laptops, it would require 1.5 million laptops together to reach the performance of LUMI. If these laptops were piled up, they would form a tower of over 23 kilometers high!</li>
<li>LUMI will also be one of the most advanced platforms in the world for artificial intelligence (AI). With LUMI, it will be possible to combine AI, especially deep learning, and traditional large scale simulations combined with massive scale data analytics in solving one research problem.</li>
<li>The number crunching capability of LUMI is accelerated by the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) partition. It is based on the future generation AMD Instinct™ GPU.</li>
<li>LUMI will be complemented by a CPU (Central Processing Unit) partition, featuring 64-core next-generation AMD EPYC™ CPUs.</li>
<li>LUMI’s data analytics partition has 32 aggregated terabytes of memory and 64 visualization GPUs. This partition is used e.g. for visualization, heavy data analysis, meshing, and pre/post-processing.</li>
<li>LUMI’s storage system will consist of three components. First, there will be a 7-petabyte partition of ultra-fast flash storage, combined with a more traditional 80-petabyte capacity storage, both based on the Lustre parallel filesystem, as well as a data management service, based on Ceph and being 30 petabytes in volume.</li>
<li>In total, LUMI will have astounding storage of 117 petabytes and an impressive aggregated I/O bandwidth of 2 terabytes per second</li>
<li>LUMI will also have an OpenShift/Kubernetes container cloud platform for running microservices.</li>
<li>All the different compute and storage partitions are connected to the very fast Cray Slingshot interconnect of 200 Gbit/s. The global bandwidth of the LUMI-GPU partition is 160 TB/s. The global Internet traffic would fit therein, in fact, two times!</li>
<li>LUMI takes over 150m2 of space, which is about the size of a tennis court. The weight of the system is nearly 150 000 kilograms (150 metric tons).</li>

              <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is a popular messaging app. It is well-known for its security and efficiency. Apart from being able to send messages to each other, its users can also create bots to automate certain routine tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this tutorial, we will use Telegram's <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">bot API</a> to create a news bot using
              <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews API</a>. We will use Python programming language, as it provides convenient abstractions over the bot API.

            </h2>

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
             We will use python-telegram-bot wrapper around the official API. This library significantly simplifies the job of the programmer when writing a bot. It is always easier to learn something new by reading through a couple of examples. Here is one:
            </p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler


USAGE = '/greet &lt;name&gt; - Greet me!'


def start(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(USAGE)


def greet_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(f'Hello {context.args[0]}!')


def main():
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater = Updater("TOKEN", use_context=True)
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp = updater.dispatcher 

&nbsp;&nbsp;# on different commands - answer in Telegram 
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start)) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command)) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;# Start the Bot 
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.start_polling() 
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.idle() 


if __name__ == '__main__': 
&nbsp;&nbsp;main()</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
              This small piece of code creates a bot that recognizes two commands:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>/start</span> - the bot will respond with the help page to this one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>/greet</span> - this command receives an argument (e.g. Datanews) and responds with <span>Hello Datanews!</span>.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let's go through each line in detail and discuss what this code does.</p>

            <p>We start with the <span>main</span> function:</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def main():
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater = Updater("TOKEN", use_context=True)
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp = updater.dispatcher

&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command))

&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.start_polling()
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.idle()</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
              This function sets up all the necessary machinery needed for our bot to work. Particularly, it creates an instance of the Updater class. Note that you need a Telegram token to be able to use Telegram bot API. Check out the official guide on how to create bots
              <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Back to the code! The purpose of the <span>Updater</span> is to deliver updates (e.g. messages sent by users) to <span>Dispatcher</span>. When the latter receives an update, it tries to dispatch some of the user-specified callbacks to handle it. Each of those callbacks is managed by some handler.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can think of a handler as a function to handle an update that is only executed when some condition is met. The condition in question, though, depends on the handler and can be specified by the programmer. In our case, we have two instances of <span>CommandHandler</span> class.
            </p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command))</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Each of them handles a particular command, supported by our bot - <span>/start</span> and <span>/greet</span> respectively.</p>

            <p>Then we call <span>start_polling</span> method.</p>

            

            <p>This will make our bot periodically fetch updates from the Telegram server. This method will internally create two threads: one will poll updates from the Telegram server, the other one will be used by the dispatcher to handle those updates.</p>

            <p>The next line makes sure our bot correctly handles various interruption signals (e.g. <span>SIGINT</span>).</p>

            

            <p>This is required when we want our bot to have persistent state. You can learn more about it and other cool library features in their
              <a href="https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

            <p>Let's now discuss two callback functions that handle bot's commands:</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def start(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(USAGE)


def greet_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(f'Hello {context.args[0]}!')</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Each of these functions takes two arguments:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>update</span> - an update received by our bot from Telegram servers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>context</span> - contains various useful methods and information. For example, it has user_data dictionary which can store various user-related information.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Additionally, each of these methods sends a text message back to the user.</p>
            
            <p>You can check out more elaborate examples of Telegram bots in the library's official <a href="https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot">repo</a>.</p>

            <p>Let's now move on to the main topic of our discussion.</p>
          </div>

            <h2>
              Datanews API overview
            </h2>

            <p><a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> provides API for retrieving and monitoring news from more than a thousand different newspapers, news aggregators and other websites. We collect and process more than 100k news articles a day. Naturally, we provide a flexible and easy-to-use API for querying those articles. For our small project, though, we only need a small part of that API. Particularly, we want our bot to be able to:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Retrieve articles based on a query string, sent by the user.</li>
              <li>Retrieve articles from some particular publisher.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              These use-cases can be handled by a single end-point - /headlines. You can learn more about the provided API in the
              <a href="https://datanews.io/docs">official documentation</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Now we can go straight to the implementation of our bot.</p>
          </div>
        </div> <!-- / .row -->
      </div> <!-- / .container -->
    </section>

        <!-- SECTION

          <div>

            <!-- Heading -->
            <h2>
              Implementation
            </h2>

            <p>First of all, let's define a callback that handles the <span>/start</span> command.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def get_usage():
&nbsp;&nbsp;return '''This bot allows you to query news articles from Datanews API.

Available commands:
/help, /start - show this help message.
/search &lt;query&gt; - retrieve news articles containing &lt;query&gt;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: "/search covid"
/publisher &lt;domain&gt; - retrieve newest articles by publisher.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: "/publisher techcrunch.com"'''

def help_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_markdown(get_usage())
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>As you can see, the implementation closely resembles our bot example above - we simply return the help information to our user. You can notice that our bot will support four commands. The <span>help_command</span> function implements the first two of them. Let's now discuss the other two.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def search_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;def fetcher(query):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return datanews.headlines(query, size=10, sortBy='date', page=0, language='en')
&nbsp;&nbsp;_fetch_data(update, context, fetcher)


def publisher_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;def fetcher(query):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return datanews.headlines(source=query, size=10, sortBy='date', page=0, language='en')
&nbsp;&nbsp;_fetch_data(update, context, fetcher)</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>These functions look very similar. They both use the <span>/headlines</span> API endpoint as discussed earlier (we are using the official
              <a href="https://github.com/DatanewsOrg/datanews-python">Datanews library for Python here</a>). They both delegate their work to a helper <span>_fetch_data</span>. The only difference is in the arguments we pass to the Datanews API: <span>search_command</span> retrieves articles matching a certain query whereas <span>publisher_command</span> fetches all articles as long as they are published by a specific source. Note, however, that in both cases we only get the first 10 most recent articles.</p>

            <p>Let's now take a look at the helper that does all the job.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def _fetch_data(update, context, fetcher):
&nbsp;&nbsp;if not context.args:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help_command(update, context)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return

&nbsp;&nbsp;query = '"' + ' '.join(context.args) + '"'
&nbsp;&nbsp;result = fetcher(query)

&nbsp;&nbsp;if not result['hits']:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text('No news is good news')
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return

&nbsp;&nbsp;last_message = update.message
&nbsp;&nbsp;for article in reversed(result['hits']):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text = article['title'] + ': ' + article['url']
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last_message = last_message.reply_text(text)</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>This function simply checks that the user has indeed specified required arguments to the command, fetches the data from the Datanews API and sends it in reverse order to the user. A couple of comments here:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>We make sure to surround a query with <span>"</span> so that Datanews returns all articles containing the complete query and not just a single word from it. You can learn more about the query syntax in the
     …</li></ol></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>While this expression may work for a mathematician, it can be a little overwhelming for other audiences. In this post I’ll provide an alternate rigorous, <em>programmatic</em>, definition of the multivariate gaussian in Python. We’ll then be able to use our mental Python interpreter to get intuition about the behavior of any multivariate gaussian.</p>
<p>I will assume familiarity with the following concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>single</em> dimensional gaussian, aka the normal random variable</li>
<li>expectation and covariance of random variables</li>
<li>vector and matrix operations, such as multiplication, and transpose</li>
<li>basic Python and numpy notation</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also need the concept of <em>simulation</em>. I’ll say that a function <em>f</em> simulates a random variable <em>F</em> if there is no way to determine, given a list of outputs, whether the list was generated by repeated function calls to <em>f</em> or whether it came from independent realizations of <em>F</em>.</p>
<p>Now we’re ready to give a computational definition of an <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dimensional multivariate gaussian.  </p>
<p>Examine this simple program.</p>

<p>Now let’s break down what <code>x(mu, M)</code> does.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill an n-dimensional vector with independent standard random normals by calling <code>z()</code>.</li>
<li>Then multiply the result by matrix <code>M</code>.</li>
<li>Then shift the result by <code>mu</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This computational viewpoint is especially useful if <code>M</code> has a geometrical interpretation. For example, suppose we are working in two dimensions <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n = 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If we graph the two columns of <code>M</code>, we can get a picture of how it warps the plane. </p>

<p>Successive calls to <code>z()</code> will generate a cloud of samples around the origin, with the cloud getting denser as we get closer to the origin. If we draw a circle around this cloud and multiply all points in the plane by <code>M</code>, we can see that we get a cloud in an elliptical shape.</p>

<p>This ellipsoid representation, by the way, is exactly what we use in the self driving car industry to represent the uncertainty estimates for the positions of other cars.</p>
<p>Suppose we know that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is simulated by <code>x(mu, M)</code> (and therefore it is, by our definition, multivariate gaussian) but we want to convert to the popular mean <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and covariance <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> parameterization. It’s a simple matter of computing statistics.</p>
<p>First let’s compute the mean.<br>
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu = E[X]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>

<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>=</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">=</annotation></semantics></math></span></span><code>mu</code></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the mean <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <code>mu</code>. We could have guessed that by looking at the illustrations above.  </p>
<p>Now let’s compute the covariance. But first a clarification about notation. Consider that <code>np.matmul(z(), z().T)</code> calls <code>z</code> <em>twice</em> and therefore generates two independent versions of <code>z</code>. How do we declare that we want the <em>same</em> sample of <code>z</code> both times? We can use an immediately invoked <code>lambda</code> expression <code>(lambda Z: np.matmul(Z Z.T))(z())</code>. (You might have seen this elsewhere called the IIFE pattern.) Okay we’re ready to compute the covariance.</p>

<p>So the covariance <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <code>M M.T</code> and we get this result.</p>
<p><strong>Result 1.</strong> If <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a gaussian simulated by <code>x(mu, M)</code>, it has mean <code>mu</code> and covariance <code>M M.T</code>.</p>
<p>It’s actually more likely you’ll need to go <em>backwards.</em> For example, if you encounter a multivariate gaussian in the wild with the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> parameterization and you need want to visualize it as an ellipsoid using the <code>mu, M</code> parameterization. For that we usually use the <em>eigendecomposition</em> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Q</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mi><msup><mi>Q</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma = Q \Lambda Q^T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p>This decomposition is extremely important in linear algebra, and I would encourage you to read up on it later. If we start with any covariance matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the eigendecomposition has the following properties.</p>

<p>So using our mental Python interpreter as before, we can visualize the samples <code>x(mu=</code><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span><code>, M=</code><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mi><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q \Lambda^{\frac 1 2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span><code>)</code> by imagining a cloud of samples contained in a sphere, then warping the sphere into an ellipsoid whose axes lengths are given by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mi><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Lambda^{\frac 1 2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and then shifting this whole ellipsoid by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to be working at a robotics company, you can do a code search for your gaussian visualization routines and I bet you will find something like the following.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>vis_gaussian</span><span>(</span>mean<span>,</span> covar<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<p>The Hypi team is incredibly proud to announce today that we’re making our second <a href="https://hypi.app/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public beta available today</a>.</p>
<p>This has been in the making for a few months after receiving very valuable feedback from our community. Not only have we listened to the original feedback, some members of our community have directly contributed to the improvements in this release.</p>

<p>Three years ago our team set out to make it easier for developers to build applications but we had no idea of the amazing journey this would take us on. In our first 18 months we built 3 different versions and threw them all away because they just weren’t quite right. We spoke to developers at conferences and meetups including WebSummit, Collision and Apache Ignite London and France. It was 18 months researching and speaking to developers 6 countries face to face and 4 more virtually all of this has culminated into what Hypi is today.</p>

<p>Several months ago we offered limited access and got feedback from the wider community. That feedback was reassuring, almost everyone felt it was a good product with great potential but were missing a few things or could be improved here and there and now we’re again announcing Hypi, a comprehensive low-code backend as a service platform.</p>

<p>Hypi’s founding purpose is to make development simple and hair-loss free. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to do that best and we summised a few things from our own experience as well as from our research and speaking to developers.</p>
<ol><li>We spend too much time repeating ourselves from project to project, sometimes even within the same project. The things that almost everyone we spoke to say they repeat a lot are:<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/crud" target="_blank">CRUD APIs</a> – the bare bones of all data driven applications</li><li>Authentication – Registration and login in</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/authorisation" target="_blank">Authorisation</a> – Access control, even more than that, <strong>flexible</strong> access control. Role based access control is great but simply doesn’t fit the bill in many cases.</li><li>Caching and scaling – even today, this remains a challenge for most developers</li></ol></li><li>We spend so much time integrating and <a href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/api-gateway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staying in sync with external services</a>.</li><li>We still have to build what are now commonplace features into our apps every time.</li></ol>
<p>The team’s very proud to say that Hypi takes care of all of these and so much more.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f99dfb0a1f04e2577108899ca48dca03f49f0d67/039b8/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/gardening-growing.jpg"></p><p>I’ve been using Twitter for almost 12 years now. It can be challenging to navigate your timeline, so today I’m sharing some tips to keep it fun.</p><p>This is the first part of my Twitter series about Gardening Your Twitter. Don’t miss out on the second part, where you can learn how to best <a href="https://steipete.com/posts/curating-your-twitter-timeline/">curate your timeline</a> and manage who to follow and unfollow.</p><h2 id="your-online-persona">Your Online Persona</h2><p>There are many strategies for online personas, but I can only share what works well for me. I follow people to cover specific areas/topics and also for their commentary/personality. In a way, Twitter is a newsfeed where the comments are presented before the content, and you pick people for both content and comments.</p><p>I’m known for talking about iOS and bootstrapping a company, and I have a pretty sharp tongue on tech news. I used to keep politics out of my feed, but since 2016, I do sprinkle in topics that are important to me — from US politics to climate change and LGBTQIA rights.</p><p>There will always be people who complain that XY topic shouldn’t be on Twitter, but in the end, it’s <em>your choice</em> what you talk about and it’s their choice to follow you.</p><p>I’m openly gay on Twitter, but only in the last few years have I also started talking about that. Being open does allow me to add a unique perspective to some content, and it adds more complexity to my persona. I almost never share pictures or private content though; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sportg33k/">that stuff is for Instagram</a>.</p><p>Whatever you go with, be authentic. I don’t share everything on Twitter, but what I do share is honest and is usually done with passion. Additionally, it can be interesting or funny. I do not share content for money or for favors, rather I only share things if I find them interesting.</p><h3 id="your-avatar">Your Avatar</h3><p>Pick an avatar you like and stick with it. I recommend a real face and not a sketch or something more abstract, as it’ll help folks identify you at conferences or events. Make sure you use the same picture and use it everywhere (GitHub, Gravatar, email, etc.) so that you have one universal online identity. People will scan the picture much faster than your name — changing it is usually something folks dislike, and it’ll result in a temporary loss of engagement. You can change it, but I recommend not doing that, or at least doing so only every few years.</p><p>Or, you can be really sneaky and just <a href="https://krausefx.com/blog/continuous-delivery-for-your-profile-picture">remake your picture so it changes slightly every year</a>.</p><h3 id="direct-messages">Direct Messages</h3><p>I highly recommend going into Settings and privacy &gt; Privacy and safety &gt; Direct Messages and enabling “Receive messages from anyone.” There’s a lot of great commentary from people that I received via DM since they’re not comfortable replying publicly. There are the occasional odd messages (and inappropriate offers), but if you’re a cis white male, you likely are good. Minority groups might want to reconsider this setting or at least enable the Quality filter.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/863f9afff497ec9faee70ce7485680fbc999fde1/a1446/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/settings.png" alt="Twitter Settings"></p><p>If in doubt, I suggest you experiment with this — the settings are easy to change if it turns out to be a bad idea.</p><h3 id="multiple-profiles">Multiple Profiles</h3><p>Quite a few of my friends have “alt” accounts for the hot takes or for talking with friends. If you work at a Big Corp, you might be required to filter what you say, and having an alt can be a solution. In general, I don’t recommend making an alt account, as it’s simply too much work to maintain multiple accounts. Just tweet out your hot takes and attract the right followers on your main account.</p><h2 id="extending-reach">Extending Reach</h2><p>The more active followers you have on Twitter, the more fun it becomes. There’s no hack or shortcut for gaining followers, but there are various things you can do that can help you steadily grow your audience.</p><h3 id="blog-posts">Blog Posts</h3><p>Twitter is a great indicator for topics that people find interesting — <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1297956386836566016">I often get my best ideas for blog posts out of Twitter conversations</a>, and I also already have half the content there. Twitter is great for inspiration and to learn, but it’s often hard to read and follow conversations. Go the extra mile and convert some of these interactions to blog posts. This will greatly extend your reach, and in turn, it’ll attract new followers who find your content interesting.</p><h3 id="conference-talks">Conference Talks</h3><p><a href="https://steipete.tv/">Speaking at conferences</a> is a great way to meet new people and extend your social circle. I often meet folks at conferences, and either we connect on Twitter or we find out that we already know each other on there! Either way — this will increase the bond and will make it more likely that people reach out to you. <strong>Conferences are work, but they are so worth it.</strong></p><p>Bonus: <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/binary-frameworks-swift/">Convert your conference talk to a blog post</a>. Very few people will actually watch a recording, so via recycling and reshaping content you already have, you can extend your reach again.</p><p>If you plan on starting to speak, create a website where you list what topics you can talk about and your bio. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/steipete/speaking">a simple GitHub repo</a> that has been proven extremely useful for me to track past events, attract new speaking gigs, and help conference organizers with getting the information they need to announce me.</p><h3 id="engage-with-your-audience">Engage with Your Audience</h3><p>I try to reply to almost everyone who interacts with me on Twitter. This doesn’t take much time, and sometimes I just reply with an emoji, but taking time to engage shows your audience you care, and they’re much more likely to interact with your content again if they know that it’s not a one-way street. Same goes for your feed — don’t just read, reply. This can range from helping others with questions/problems to just posting a “me too” retweet. Sometimes I get content in my feed via a retweet, and by interacting with that, I get a new follower.</p><h3 id="tracking-statistics">Tracking Statistics</h3><p>Be consistent. You won’t grow an audience overnight. Make Twitter a daily thing. Share content. Be present — and you’ll grow your audience every day.</p><p><a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/">Twitter Analytics</a> is great to understand which tweets work. To track long-term performance, I’m using <a href="http://birdbrainapp.com/">Birdbrain</a>. It’s one of the oldest apps on my phone, so I have data since 2014. Interestingly, my follower count has been growing pretty much linearly:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b753fb6d7ed16ff2e572edcc90d8143bf73653eb/38f85/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/follower.png" alt="Birdbrain Follower Count of @steipete" width="50%"></p><h2 id="tweets-that-work">Tweets that Work</h2><p>I do share a lot of news articles. I often just quote something interesting from the news if it doesn’t need strong commentary, but the inclusion of a pull quote helps show that it’s worth reading.</p><p>The tweets that are the most engaging, however, usually are original content, particularly in context with your audience and topics of interest. Here are some of my top performing tweets from the last few months, with about 80K–450K impressions each. Sometimes it’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1310331623729229827">ridiculous tweets that explode</a>, and sometimes you <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1306884214252613632?s=20">don’t need words</a>. It also can be news commentary if the comment <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1288151223028322304">really nails it</a> or just <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1281547449660825601">really fits</a>.</p><h3 id="using-threads">Using Threads</h3><p>Lately I’ve been using more and more threads to connect tweets over time — this has been proven to be really great, as it immediately gives people context, they can read more, and the official Twitter client also usually shows 2–3 tweets in a thread, giving you more “space” in the timeline. Here’s an example:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><h2 id="curating-your-timeline">Curating Your Timeline</h2><p>Who you follow defines your Twitter experience.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>At Pixie, we are working on a Kubernetes native monitoring system which stores and processes the resulting data entirely within a user’s cluster. This is the first in a series of posts discussing techniques and best practices for effectively building Kubernetes native applications. In this post, we explore the trade-offs between using an air-gapped deployment that lives completely within a cluster and a system which splits the control and data planes between the cloud and cluster, respectively.  </p><p>One benefit of building for the Kubernetes platform is that it simplifies the process of deploying applications to a user’s environment, often requiring only a few simple steps such as applying a set of YAMLs or installing a Helm Chart. Within minutes, users can easily have a running version of the application on their cluster. However, now that these applications are running entirely on prem, it becomes difficult for the developer to manage. In many cases, rolling out major updates or bug fixes relies on having the user manually update their deployment. This is unreliable for the developer and burdensome for the user.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/e4ba6d3f5793c83a25a64e4fba9e2981/connected-on-prem.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of a connected on-prem architecture.</figcaption></figure></div><p>To address this problem, we propose a connected on-prem architecture which delegates the responsibility of managing the data and control planes of the application to the deployment running in the cluster and a developer-managed cloud environment, respectively. More concretely, the application deployed in the user’s cluster is solely responsible for collecting data and making that data accessible. Once the foundation of this data layer is established, the logic remains mostly stable and is infrequently updated. Meanwhile, a cloud-hosted system manages the core functionality and orchestration of the application. As the cloud is managed by the developer themselves, they are freely able to perform updates without any dependency on the users. This allows the developer to iterate quickly on the functionality of their system, all while maintaining data locality on prem.</p><p>This split-responsibility architecture is common in many hardware products, since external factors may make it challenging to deploy updates to software running on physical devices. For instance, despite these physical limitations, <a href="https://www.ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiqiti</a>’s UI is able to offer a rich feature-set by delegating functionality to their cloud and keeping their physical routers within the data plane. Similarly, <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebRTC</a> is a standard built into most modern browsers for handling voice and video data. Although browser updates are infrequent, having the separated data and control layers allows developers to freely build a diverse set of applications on top of WebRTC. This architecture is still relatively uncommon in enterprise software, but has been adopted by popular products such as <a href="https://harness.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/arch_2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harness</a>, <a href="https://streamsets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamsets</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthos</a>.</p><p>However, designing a connected on-prem architecture is easier said than done. When building such a system, one challenge you may encounter is how to query data from an application running on the user’s cluster via a UI hosted in the cloud. We explore two approaches for doing so:</p><ol><li>Making requests directly to the application in the cluster</li><li>Proxying requests through the cloud</li></ol><p>For brevity, we will refer to the application running on the user’s cluster as a satellite.</p><h2>Approach 1: Making Requests Directly to the Application in the Cluster</h2><p>The simplest approach for executing the query on a satellite is to have the UI make the request directly to the satellite itself. To do this, the UI must be able to get the (1) status and (2) address of the satellite from the cloud, so that it knows whether the satellite is available for querying and where it should make requests to. </p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/eb62b05f17165493ca6c988177555267/non-passthrough.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of Non-Passthrough Mode where the UI makes requests directly to the satellite agent itself.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Step 1: Heartbeating</h3><p>A common technique to track the status of a program is to establish a heartbeat sequence between the program (the satellite) and the monitoring system (the cloud). This is typically done by having the satellite first send a registration message to the cloud. During registration, the satellite either provides an identifier or is assigned an identifier via the cloud, which is used to identify the satellite in subsequent heartbeat messages.</p><p>Following registration, the satellite begins sending periodic heartbeats to the cloud to indicate it is alive and healthy. Additional information can be sent in these heartbeats. In our case, we also attach the satellite’s IP address. Alternatively, the IP address could have been sent during registration, if it is not subject to change. The cloud records the satellite’s status and address so that it can be queried by the UI.</p><p>Now, when the UI wants to make a request to a satellite, it first queries the cloud for the address, then directly makes the request to that address. </p><p>Great! That wasn’t too bad. In many cases, many cloud/distributed satellite architectures already communicate via heartbeats to track satellite state, so sending an additional address is no problem. However... If your UI is running on a browser and your satellite is responding over HTTPS (likely with self-signed certs), you are not done yet...</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/f178e72484d5e1de0dcc20d539cd25d6/cert-authority-invalid-1.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h3>Step 2: Assigning Satellites a Domain Name</h3><p>The browser is blocking our requests because of the satellite’s SSL certs! A user could go ahead and navigate directly to the satellite’s address, where the browser prompts the user with whether or not they want to bypass the invalid cert.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2473c1e3bd36f293ccf4938cd7d1b4f4/cert-authority-invalid-2.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>However, this would need to be done per satellite and is disruptive to the user’s overall experience. It is possible to generate SSL certs for IP addresses, but this is uncommon and isn’t available with most free Certificate Authorities. This approach is also complicated if the satellite’s IP address is subject to change. </p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/16755003b378767879ee5d066ff07608/SSL-cert-flow.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of SSL certification flow for Non-Passthrough Mode.</figcaption></figure></div><p>To solve this problem, we used the following solution:</p><ol><li>Pre-generate SSL certs under a subdomain that you control, for instance: <code>&lt;uuid&gt;.satellites.yourdomain.com</code>. This step is easy to do with any free Certificate Authority <em>and can be safely done if the subdomain has a well-known DNS address</em>. You should make sure to generate more SSL certs than the number of expected satellites. </li><li>When an satellite registers with the cloud, it should be assigned an unused SSL cert and associated subdomain. The SSL cert should be securely sent to the satellite and the satellite’s proxy should be updated to use the new cert.</li><li>When the cloud receives the satellite’s IP address from its heartbeats, it updates the DNS record for the satellite’s subdomain to point to the IP address. </li><li>When executing queries, the UI can now safely make requests to the satellite’s assigned subdomain rather than directly to its IP address, all with valid certs!</li></ol><p>In the end, making requests directly to the satellites turned out to be more complicated (and hacky) than we’d originally thought. The solution also doesn’t scale well, since the SSL certs need to be pre-generated. Without having a fixed number of satellites, or an upperbound on the number of satellites, it isn’t long before all the certs have been assigned and someone needs to step in and manually generate more. It is possible to generate the certs and their DNS records on the fly, but we’ve found these operations can take too long to propagate to all networks. <em>It is also important to note that this approach may violate the terms of service for automated SSL generation and is susceptible to usual security risks of wildcard certificates.</em></p><p>When a satellite is behind a firewall, it will only be queryable by users within the network. This further ensures that no sensitive data leaves the network.</p><h2>Approach 2: Proxying Queries through the Server</h2><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2aea205714b53dd0286e660bec0c9370/passthrough-general.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of Passthrough Mode where UI requests are proxied through the cloud.</figcaption></figure></div><p>As seen in the previous approach, it is easiest to have the UI make requests to the cloud to avoid any certificate errors. However, we still want the actual query execution to be handled by the satellites themselves. To solve this, we architected another approach which follows these general steps:</p><ol><li>User initiates query via the UI.</li><li>The cloud forwards the query to the appropriate satellite.</li><li>Satellite send its responses back to the cloud.</li><li>Cloud forwards responses back to the UI.</li></ol><p>The cloud must be able to handle multiple queries to many different satellites at once. A satellite will stream batches of data in response, which the server needs to send to the correct requestor. With so many messages flying back and forth, all of which need to be contained within their own request/reply channels, we thought this would be the perfect job for a message bus. </p><p>The next question was: which message bus should we use? </p><h3>Choosing a Message Bus</h3><p>We built up a list of criteria that we wanted our message bus to fulfill: </p><ul><li>It should receive and send messages quickly, especially since there is a user waiting at the receiving end.</li><li>It should be able to handle relatively large messages. An satellite’s query response can be batched into many smaller messages, but the size of a single datapoint can still be non-trivial.</li><li>Similarly, since an satellite’s response may be batched into many messages, the message bus should be able to handle a large influx of messages at any given time.</li><li>It should be easy to start new channels at any time. We may want to create a new channel per request or per satellite, all of which we have no fixed number.</li></ul><p>We briefly considered Google Pub/Sub, which had strict quota requirements (only 10,000 topics per Google project), and other projects such as Apache Pulsar. However, we primarily considered two messaging systems: Apache Kafka and NATS. General comparisons between Kafka and NATS have been discussed at length in other blogs. In this blog post, we aim to compare these two systems based on our requirements above.</p><p>We relied heavily on benchmarks that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/category/benchmarking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others have performed</a> to judge latency based on message size and message volume. These results lean in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>mTCP runs on all variants of DOS including IBM PC-DOS,
Microsoft
MS-DOS, DR-DOS and FreeDOS. All of these applications will run well on
the oldest, slowest PC that you
can find - I routinely use them on an IBM PCjr made in 1983 because
nothing beats
the fun of putting a 35+ year old computer on the Internet.</p>

<p>People are using mTCP for goofing off and for real work. If
you have a DOS machine that needs to send data across the network mTCP
can help you get that done. Besides its utility to vintage computers I
have heard of people using it to transfer lab data from dedicated
industrial PCs, allowing backups to be run on old machines, and sending
sales reports from the branch offices of a retail store to a central
server.</p>

<p>Don't have a vintage computer laying around? No problem! mTCP
applications will run in a variety of virtual and emulated
environments. It has been tested with modified DOSBox builds,&nbsp;
VirtualBox, VMWare, and QEMU. See the documentation for the details.</p>



<p>mTCP applications should work on any IBM PC compatible personal
computer running
DOS. To be more specific:</p>

<ul>

  <li>An IBM PC compatible with an 8088 or better CPU</li>
  <li>96KB to 256KB of system memory depending on the application</li>
  <li>DOS 2.1 or newer</li>
  <li>A network card (Ethernet adapter, or a device emulating Ethernet)
that has a "packet driver" (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
A packet driver is a utility that lets a program send and receive
Ethernet packets using your network card. The packet driver
specification is widely supported by both old and new
Ethernet cards. If your Ethernet card does not have a packet driver
available an NDIS or ODI driver with a "shim" to convert to the packet
specification should work but that will require more memory and be
slower
than having a real packet driver. SLIP and PPP connections are also
supported if they use a packet driver that emulates Ethernet. See <a href="http://crynwr.com/packet_driver.html">http://crynwr.com/packet_driver.html</a>
for more information on the packet driver specification.
</p>

<p>My personal testing includes:</p>

<p>Machines:</p>

<ul>

  <li>8088 class: IBM PC, IBM PC XT, IBM PCjr, IBM Portable PC, IBM
Convertible, IBM PS/2 Model 25, Compaq Portable</li>
  <li>80286/80386/80486: IBM PC AT, generic 80386-40, several generic
80486 systems, Compaq Deskpro 433i</li>
  <li>Pentium and better: generic Pentium 1, IBM Aptiva (AMD), generic
Pentium II</li>
  <li>Virtual machines: VMWare, VirtualBox</li>
  <li>Emulation environments: DOSBox (H-A-L 9000 "megabuild")<br>
  </li>
</ul>

Ethernet adapters:<br>

<ul>

  <li> <a href="http://www.brutman.com/Dos_Networking/xircom_pe3.html">Xircom
PE3-10BT</a></li>
  <li>Novell NE1000, NE2000 and clones</li>
  <li>3Com 3C503</li>
  <li>WD/SMC 8003 series</li>
  <li>Intel EtherExpress 8/16</li>
  <li>Davicom DM9008F</li>
  <li>LinkSys PCI</li>
  <li>SLIP/PPP connections using "EtherSLIP" (emulates Ethernet using a
serial connection.)<br>
  </li>
</ul>

Hundreds (thousands?) of people are using mTCP on a diverse set of
hardware. If your machine runs DOS and you have a packet driver for
your Ethernet card, then mTCP will probably work for you.&nbsp; SLIP
and PPP are also supported via EtherSLIP, so any machine with a serial
port can work too.

<p>mTCP is a hobby project that I started in 2005. While it is only a
hobby project, I take
pride in my work. If you have a comment, bug, or suggestion for a
feature please email me at mbbrutman at gmail.com. I might ask for
further
information or a trace from the program you are having trouble with.
Your bug reports help me make mTCP better for everybody else.</p>

<p>If you need a change to make mTCP work better for you I am
interested in hearing your requirements. I am willing to write custom
code if needed, but instead of charging for that service I suggest
making a donation to a local animal shelter of your choice. (I have
never seen an over-funded animal shelter.) Contact me with what you
need and I'll see what I can do. (And thank you to those who have taken
me up on this offer!)<br>
</p>

</ul>

<p>Interested in seeing the source code that lets you talk
directly to a
packet driver? I have taken the lowest layer of the mTCP code and
packaged it
with a sample application that shows you how to interface a C program
with the software interrupt mechanism used by packet drivers. Check it
out here: <a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_tcpacket.html">mTCP_tcpacket.html</a></p>



<p><span></span>Jump in!&nbsp; See the mTCP
Programming Sample! <a href="http://brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Programming_Sample.html">http://brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Programming_Sample.html</a><br>
</p>

<p>All of the applications use the mTCP TCP/IP library which is
designed
for high performance even on small, slower machines. The code is
written in a combination of C++ and assembler. The style of coding is
more like "C with classes" to improve the structure of the code with
assembler being used in limited areas to improve the performance. The
source code is fairly well commented. You can look at
it as a framework for writing TCP/IP applications for DOS, complete
with plenty of examples.</p>

<p>Features include ARP, UDP, DNS, IP fragments, listen and
accept calls
for server applications, configurable buffer sizes, automatic
retransmit using Karne's algorithm, and run-time switchable tracing for
helping you debug. Features may be compiled in or out as needed so that
you can minimize the overhead of the TCP/IP library and include only
the features that you need. mTCP does not use floating point
operations, avoiding the code bloat of the floating point emulation
library.</p>

<p>mTCP is designed to be robust. DOS is a challenging
environment to work
in because quite frankly, it is not much of an operating system. mTCP
attempts to minimize problems by using defensive programming
techniques. Not every programming error can be prevented, but the
library tries to help you where it can. For example, to prevent
fragmentation in the DOS heap mTCP generally preallocates pools of
objects and manages the objects instead of repeatedly allocating and
freeing memory using the DOS heap. The FTP server and the IRC client
have been demonstrated to run for days without leaking memory or
crashing the machine.</p>

<p>High performance is a key feature of mTCP. The library is
written to
avoid excess memory copying wherever possible. Assembler is used on
some code for both performance and to avoid making expensive library
calls that will just invoke BIOS or DOS routines anyway. For the
ultimate in performance you can choose to handle raw packets directly
in your application layer code, or you can use higher level "send" and
"recv" type calls instead. The ability to adjust buffer sizes allows
you to balance speed versus memory footprint. Want to see how fast mTCP
is? Here are some performance measurements
for FTP and for raw socket performance: <a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Performance.html">mTCP
Performance notes</a></p>

<p>mTCP is only available as a library that you link with your
application. A TSR version that can be used by software interrupt is
not available. While a TSR version would allow more programming
environments access to TCP/IP services, it is a much more difficult
environment to work in and debug. Performance would also suffer too. It
would be an interesting project though - if you want to collaborate on
the design for a TSR version of mTCP please contact me.</p>

<p>(For a TCP/IP stack that loads as a TSR see Trumpet by Peter Tattam.
Trumpet can usually be found by searching for TCPDRV or NTCPDRV. WATTCP
is an older, more widespread TCP/IP stack that can be used as an
alternative to mTCP. Neither Trumpet or WATTCP are actively
maintained.)</p>

<ol>
<li>The famous distance strategy (most-cited)</li>
<li>Advanced distance measures</li>
<li>Co-integration tests</li>
<li>Kalman Filter</li>
<li>OU and XOU models + fitting</li>

<li>Models to determine time-series properties</li>
<li>n-asset mean reverting portfolios</li>
<li>PCA technique</li>
</ol>
<p>Then in the months to follow we will add machine learning models to identify pairs, ARODs, and various ways to model and trade the spread. A lot of what we build next will be based on user feedback and the tools that they use the most.</p>
<p>The new library will start off as a monthly subscription service, with the python library being installed locally, so users can still view the source code and audit the techniques.</p>

I like it, I find the tool useful, and that’s that. But the great debate started over our lord and savior, <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a>. Yeah, I know, XML vs. JSON vs. YAML vs. TOML vs. the next thing is a tired and old debate.</p><p>Let me level set here. I routinely joke about how I’m a “Calendar Driven YAML Engineer” and have been for years on <a href="https://openshift.tv/">openshift.tv</a>. But I’m not too fond of YAML. Let me tell you a story…</p><p>In 2012, I worked at McClatchy Interactive (before the really dark times) and enjoyed the systems and security work I was doing. We had our machine creation down to a finite science. Bare metal spun up, you punched the MAC address into a database file, and off the machine went to get all the needed packaging and code to run as its defined purpose in our infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine">CFEngine</a> provisioned the machine accordingly based on purpose and positioned it in the network ready for code deployment. DevOps was something the company was embracing at the time. So instead of using the existing CFEngine infrastructure, the DevOps tandem at the time was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(company)">Puppet</a> for code deploys. This system worked fine until it didn’t. There were clear lines between infrastructure (typical IT in the datacenter) and software deployment and configuration (developers). In our case, DevOps represented the development team more so than the Operations team. Sound familiar?</p><p>But, as you can imagine, even with all the automation in place, it was still a throw over the wall kind of scenario. When Puppet needed system packages installed because of modifications to the codebase (requiring a newer version of Perl, for example) or new services coming online using different OS packages, Puppet now had to do the task CFEngine was doing; systems management. The idea was to build an overarching WebOps team that was cross-functional, spirited, and deeply technical. The first edict laid down to the team by the DevOps lead was, “read the <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML spec</a>.” We were all jumping into the Puppet pool to help integrate our processes and procedures better.</p><p>“Ugh…” I thought to myself. “I have to read this horribly written spec.” It was not an RFC, which I am fond of reading, but something about the YAML spec made me sad and frustrated. Syntax <em>really</em> mattered. Whitespace <em>really</em> mattered. My experiences have taught me that rote memorization and getting humans to see the absence of something were incredibly difficult tasks. These are things that most hackers take advantage of when infiltrating systems. Humans aren’t as good as computers at finding the absence of something or memorizing things. I was not too fond of this non-markup language for these reasons.</p><p>It irked me that the YAML creators laid out goal #1 as “YAML is easily readable by humans.” It is human-readable because you see the human-readable words in the scalars and structures, but there was something off-putting about YAML. It was a markup language claiming not to be a markup language.

It’s not friendly to new people in the same sense <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> isn’t. <a href="https://www.kubernetes.dev/">Kubernetes</a> has almost abused YAML to the point that it has become a punchline. And we’ve stuck ourselves with it for a long time to come too. If Kubernetes is the platform of the future, that means we’ll be using a spec written in 2009 well into the 2030s (and likely beyond).</p><p>I hope that a drop in replacement is possible. The fact that we need tools like <a href="https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/">yq</a> does show that there is some work to be done when it comes to wrangling the YAML beast at scale. In 2009, when the latest version of the YAML spec was written, no one thought of applying pod security policies to massive Kubernetes deployments spread out across data centers the world over. Something better will come along and I hope adopting it isn’t as painful as adopting YAML is.</p><p>Remember, comparing things relatively to like something (YAML vs. XML or YAML vs. JSON) completely throws out the beginner’s journey. Start from the newb and go forward from there. YAML doesn’t. Git doesn’t. Incrementally, YAML is better than XML but, it sucks compared to something like HTML or Markdown (which I can teach to execs and children alike). Yes, balancing machine and human readability is hard. The compromises suck, but, at some point, there’s enough compute to run a process to take in something 100% human-readable and make it 100% machine-readable. In the same sense that compute has become so readily available that we gzip and encrypt almost all HTTP traffic today, I hope we can do the same with systems configuration languages. Move the complexity from the human to code. Computers are better at remembering things and syntax-semantics than humans could ever hope to be.</p><p>There’s always a happy medium between human and machine readability. However, I’d much rather see a human first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">80-20</a> approach here where entry-level skills can solve 80% of the markup language’s use cases. That’s the true nirvana, in my opinion. There will always be complexity and a need to understand the tool you’re using. But, YAML gives us an example that there can and should be better things.</p><hr><h4>See also</h4><ul><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/2019-learnings-2020-expectations/">2019 Learnings, 2020 Expectations</a></li><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/">Docker, Inc is Dead</a></li><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/live-streaming-on-openshift.tv-and-some-lessons-learned/">Live streaming on openshift.tv and some lessons learned</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a> asks how to decide between the lives of people in two groups. At the moment, it comes up in our industry in discussions around self-driving cars: Suppose a car gets into a situation where it must risk injuring either its passengers or pedestrians; which ones should it prioritize saving?</p>
<p>Always choosing one group leads to suboptimal outcomes. If we always save the pedestrians, they may perform attacks on car riders by willfully stepping into traffic. If we always save the passengers, we may run over a pedestrian whose life happens to be of greater worth than that of the passengers.</p>
<p>The crux of the trolley problem is how we should make the choice of what lives to save. As with all hard problems without clear metrics for success, it’s best to solve this by having the participants decide this for themselves.</p>
<p>Every time we view a website, our friendly ad networks must decide what ads we should see. This is done by having our user profile put up on auction for prospective advertisers. During a handful of milliseconds, participants may inspect our profile and place a bid for our attention according to what they see.</p>
<p>The same technology could be trivially repurposed for deciding the trolley problem in the context of self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Assume the identity of every participant in the trolley scenario is known. Practically, we know the identity of the passengers; that of the pedestrians could be known if their phones broadcast a special short-range identification signal. An incentive for broadcasting such a signal could be that we would have to assume that a person without one were one of no means.</p>
<p>Given this information, a car about to be involved in a collision could take a few milliseconds to send the identities of the people involved to an auction service. Participants who had the foresight of purchasing accident insurance would have agents bidding on their behalf. The winner of the bid would be safe from the forthcoming accident, and their insurance would pay some sum to the car manufacturer post-hoc as a reward for conforming to the rules.</p>
<p>The greater a person’s individual wealth, the better insurance coverage and latencies they could purchase, and the more accidents they could expect to survive. This aligns nicely with the values of societies like the United States, where the worth of a person’s life is proportional to their wealth.</p>
<p>As this system lets self-driving car manufacturers off the hook for any decisions taken, and would need coordinated ethical action on the behalf of software engineers to not be implemented, we expect to see this system in action in the world in short order.</p>

        <p>Posted on Hacker News there was an <a href="https://github.com/markshannon/faster-cpython/blob/master/plan.md">Implementation Plan</a>
for making CPython (the official Python implementation) faster. The author claims a 5x speedup
is possible for the low cost of <a href="https://github.com/markshannon/faster-cpython/blob/master/funding.md">$2 million</a> USD.</p>
<p>The four step plan includes</p>
<ul>
<li>creating an adaptive interpreter</li>
<li>improvements to internal types</li>
<li>creating a JIT compiler</li>
<li>extending the JIT compiler</li>

of success in terms of performance and compatibility. For posterity I started keeping a
list of them here, in no particular order.</p>

<p>Data teams are starting to realize that operational machine learning requires solving data problems that extend far beyond the creation of data pipelines.</p>



<p>In Tecton’s previous post, <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/devops-ml-data/">Why We Need DevOps for ML Data</a>, we highlighted some of the key data challenges that teams face when productionizing ML systems.</p>



<ul><li>Accessing the right raw data</li><li>Building features from raw data</li><li>Combining features into training data</li><li>Calculating and serving features in production</li><li>Monitoring features in production</li></ul>



<p>Production data systems, whether for large scale analytics or real-time streaming, aren’t new. However, <em>operational machine learning</em> — ML-driven intelligence built into customer-facing applications — is new for most teams. The challenge of deploying machine learning to production for operational purposes (e.g. recommender systems, fraud detection, personalization, etc.) introduces new requirements for our data tools.</p>



<p>A new kind of ML-specific data infrastructure is emerging to make that possible.</p>



<p>Increasingly Data Science and Data Engineering teams are turning towards feature stores to manage the data sets and data pipelines needed to productionize their ML applications. This post describes the key components of a modern feature store and how the sum of these parts act as a force multiplier on organizations, by reducing duplication of data engineering efforts, speeding up the machine learning lifecycle, and unlocking a new kind of collaboration across data science teams.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Quick refresher: in ML, a <strong>feature</strong> is data used as an input signal to a predictive model.</td></tr><tr><td>For example, if a credit card company is trying to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent, a useful feature might be <em>whether the transaction is happening in a foreign country</em>, or <em>how the size of this transaction compares to the customer’s typical transaction</em>. When we refer to a feature, we’re usually referring to the concept of that signal (e.g. “transaction_in_foreign_country”), not a specific value of the feature (e.g. not “transaction #1364 was in a foreign country”).</td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore1.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>











<p><strong><em>“The interface between models and data”</em></strong></p>



<p>We first introduced feature stores in our blog post describing Uber’s <a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/">Michelangelo</a> platform. Feature stores have since emerged as a necessary component of the operational machine learning stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feature stores make it easy to:</p>



<ol><li>Productionize new features without extensive engineering support</li><li>Automate feature computation, backfills, and logging</li><li>Share and reuse feature pipelines across teams</li><li>Track feature versions, lineage, and metadata</li><li>Achieve consistency between training and serving data</li><li>Monitor the health of feature pipelines in production</li></ol>



<p>Feature stores aim to solve the full set of data management problems encountered when building and operating operational ML applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A feature store is an ML-specific data system that:</p>



<ul><li>Runs data pipelines that <strong>transform</strong> raw data into feature values</li><li><strong>Stores</strong> and manages the feature data itself, and</li><li><strong>Serves</strong> feature data consistently for training and inference purposes</li></ul>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore10.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>To support simple feature management, feature stores provide data abstractions that make it easy to build, deploy, and reason about feature pipelines across environments. For example, they make it easy to define a feature transformation once, then calculate and serve its values consistently across both the development environment (for training on historical values) and the production environment (for inference with fresh feature values).</p>



<p>Feature stores act as a central hub for feature data and metadata across an ML project’s lifecycle. Data in a feature store is used for:</p>



<ul><li>feature exploration and engineering</li><li>model iteration, training, and debugging</li><li>feature discovery and sharing</li><li>production serving to a model for inference</li><li>operational health monitoring</li></ul>



<p>Feature stores bring economies of scale to ML organizations by enabling collaboration. When a feature is registered in a feature store, it becomes available for immediate reuse by other models across the organization. This reduces duplication of data engineering efforts and allows new ML projects to bootstrap with a library of curated production-ready features.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore9.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Effective feature stores are designed to be modular systems that can be adapted to the environment in which they’re deployed. There are five primary components that typically make up a feature store. In the rest of this post, we will walk through those components and describe their role in powering operational ML applications.</p>







<p>There are 5 main components of a modern feature store: Transformation, Storage, Serving, Monitoring, and feature Registry.</p>



<figure><img alt="" data-src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore3.svg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>In the following sections we’ll give an overview of the purpose and typical capabilities of each of these sections.</p>



<h2>Serving</h2>



<p>Feature stores serve feature data to models. Those models require a <strong>consistent view of features across training and serving</strong>. The definitions of features used to train a model must exactly match the features provided in online serving. When they don’t match, <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml#:~:text=Training%2Dserving%20skew%20is%20a,train%20and%20when%20you%20serve.">training-serving skew</a> is introduced which can cause catastrophic and hard-to-debug model performance problems.</p>



<p><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore5.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>







<p>Feature stores abstract away the logic and processing used to generate a feature, providing users an easy and canonical way to access all features in a company consistently across all environments in which they’re needed.</p>



<p>When retrieving data offline (i.e. for training), feature values are commonly accessed through notebook-friendly feature store SDKs. They provide point-in-time correct views of the state of the world for each example used to train a model (a.k.a. “<a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/time-travel-in-ml/"><strong>time-travel</strong></a>”).</p>



<p>For online serving, a feature store delivers a single vector of features at a time made up of the freshest feature values. Responses are served through a high-performance API backed by a low-latency database.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore11.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<h2>Storage</h2>



<p>Feature stores persist feature data to support retrieval through feature serving layers. They typically contain both an online and offline storage layer to support the requirements of different feature serving systems.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore8.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Offline storage layers are typically used to store months’ or years’ worth of feature data for training purposes. Offline feature store data is often stored in data warehouses or data lakes like S3, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift. Extending an existing data lake or data warehouse for offline feature storage is typically preferred to prevent data silos.</p>



<p>Online storage layers are used to persist feature values for low-latency lookup during inference. They typically only store the latest feature values for each entity, essentially modeling the current state of the world. Online stores are usually eventually consistent, and do not have strict consistency requirements for most ML use cases. They are usually implemented with key-value stores like DynamoDB, Redis, or Cassandra.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore6.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Feature stores use an entity-based data model where each feature value is associated with an entity (e.g. a user) and a timestamp. An entity-based data model provides minimal structure to support standardized feature management, fits naturally with common feature engineering workflows, and allows for simple retrieval queries in production.</p>



<h2>Transformation</h2>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore2.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Operational ML applications require regular processing of new data into feature values so models can make predictions using an up-to-date view of the world. Feature stores both manage and orchestrate data transformations that produce these values, as well as ingest values produced by external systems. Transformations managed by feature stores are configured by definitions in a common feature registry (described below).</p>



<figure><p>Most teams getting started with feature stores already have existing data pipelines producing feature values. This makes it very important for feature stores to be gradually adoptable and have first class integrations with existing data platforms, allowing teams to immediately operationalize existing ETL pipelines for their ML use cases.</p></figure>



<p>Feature stores commonly interact with three main types of data transformations:</p>







<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Feature Type</td><td>Definition</td><td>Common input data source</td><td data-align="left">Example</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Batch Transform</td><td>Transformations that are applied only to data at rest</td><td>Data warehouse, data lake, database</td><td data-align="left">User country, product category</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Streaming Transform</td><td>Transformations that are applied to streaming sources</td><td>Kafka, Kinesis, PubSub</td><td data-align="left"># of clicks per vertical per user in last 30 minutes, # of views per listing in past hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">On-demand transform</td><td>Transformations that are used to produce features&nbsp; based on data that is only available at the time of the prediction. These features cannot be pre-computed.</td><td>User-facing application</td><td data-align="left">Is the user currently in a supported location?<br>Similarity score between listing and search query</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A key benefit is to make it easy to use different types of features together in the same models.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore12.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Models need access to fresh feature values for inference. Feature stores accomplish this by regularly recomputing features on an ongoing basis. Transformation jobs are orchestrated to ensure new data is processed and turned into fresh new feature values. These jobs are executed on data processing engines (e.g. Spark or Pandas) to which the feature store is connected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Model development introduces different transformation requirements. When iterating on a model, new features are often engineered to be used in training datasets that correspond to historical events (e.g. all purchases in the past 6 months). To support these use cases, feature stores make it easy to run “backfill jobs” that generate and persist historical values of a feature for training. Some feature stores automatically backfill newly registered features for preconfigured time ranges for registered training datasets.</p>



<p>Transformation code is reused across environments preventing …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today on Makerlog Stories, we interview maker, writer &amp; entrepreneur Arvid Kahl. He's grown a successful SaaS, Feedback Panda, to astronomical MRR levels â€“ to then sell the startup &amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Sold-Start-Bootstrapped-Business-ebook/dp/B08BWZS8VN">write a hit book</a> to share his breadth of knowledge.</p><h2 id="hi-arvid-tell-us-a-bit-about-yourself-">Hi Arvid! Tell us a bit about yourself.</h2><p>Iâ€™m Arvid, a developer, entrepreneur, and writer. Iâ€™ve been coding for most of my life, and Iâ€™ve always been interested in building businesses. Over the last two decades, I worked as a software engineer for small businesses, VC-funded Silicon Valley startups, and founded a number of bootstrapped businesses with friends and colleagues. Most recently, I sold the EdTech SaaS FeedbackPanda for a life-changing amount of money after growing it to $55.000 MRR with my partner Danielle Simpson from 2017 to 2019. The learnings from that journey have been the foundation for my book Zero to Sold.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-building-arvid">What are you building, Arvid?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getmakerlog.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png"></figure><p>Ever since selling the business, I have been writing. I didnâ€™t have any time to meaningfully reflect on my experiences while I was running FeedbackPanda. The moment we sold the company, I suddenly had all the time I needed to think about my experiences and translate them into stories and guidance for other founders. </p><p>Iâ€™m blogging every week, I release a new podcast episode every Friday, and I am currently working on my <a href="https://audiencefirst.link/">next book, â€œAudience Firstâ€�</a>.</p><h2 id="as-of-right-now-what-are-your-stats">As of right now, what are your stats?</h2><p>Zero to Sold has sold almost 2500 copies in its first quarter on the market. </p><p>I donâ€™t track much more beyond that, as having sold a business recently makes this less important. What I do track is how engaged people are with my work, and I can report that with almost 9000 followers on Twitter, this is looking pretty good.</p><h2 id="what-was-the-inspiration-behind-zero-to-sold"><br>What was the inspiration behind Zero to Sold?</h2><p>When we sold the business and transitioned it over to the new owners, we quickly realized that all of a sudden, we had come to an abrupt halt after working 24/7 for years. Within a week, we went from full-time entrepreneurs to founders without a purpose. </p><blockquote>Within a week, we went from full-time entrepreneurs to founders without a purpose. </blockquote><p>Very quickly, I decided that I needed to turn our experience into something useful for the community that had taught and lifted me up over many years. Initially, I didnâ€™t think of writing a book, but just writing articles. At some point, however, it was very clear that all those topics I wrote about were connected, and a book would pull them all together.</p><h2 id="what-was-it-like-to-sell-feedbackpanda">What was it like to sell FeedbackPanda?</h2><p>Selling a business is incredibly exciting, and it is very scary. Most people donâ€™t regularly sell their livelihood, and the amounts of money involved are staggering. It was a wonderful experience, mostly because our acquirer SureSwift Capital were such a joy to work with. The sale, the transition, and onboarding our replacements were delightful activities. Iâ€™d definitely do it again.</p><h2 id="how-was-the-process-of-writing-zero-to-sold">How was the process of writing Zero to Sold?</h2><p>Many chapters were already written when I decided that I would write a book, as I had posted to my blog for many months at that point. The rest of them were written in an intense flurry of writing that happened over the course of two weeks.</p><p><strong>I already had a lot of validation from my blog audience, and I knew which topics they would want me to write about because I asked them.</strong> I asked on Twitter, I asked in the Newsletter, I asked on my podcast. I was confident that the things I had yet to write were interesting because people demanded content, and I knew that the things I had already written were well-received because the blog visitor numbers painted that picture.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-spread-the-word-of-the-book">How did you spread the word of the book? </h2><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A few people have been asking me why I sell a 500-page book for $9.99 when it could sell for 4x that.</p><p>I want Zero to Sold to be affordable AND contain everything I know about building businesses. I want as many people as possible to read the book. That's it. Money is secondary.</p></div>— Arvid Kahl (@arvidkahl) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1286377587757981696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p><strong>I utilized Twitter substantially for the promotion of Zero to Sold.</strong> On the very first day, I published a long Twitter thread with all sorts of links, insights into why I wrote the book, who it was for, and where to find it. I engaged with everyone who liked the post, thanked everyone who retweeted it, and took a lot of time to be present for my Twitter followers. Very quickly, sales took off, and I leveraged that too. I shared screenshots of climbing numbers, which themselves encouraged people to check out the book. </p><p>The next day, I launched on Product Hunt, and had Zero to Sold in the #1 spot for 18 hours. For the next few weeks, I shared a lot of sales figures, and I engaged with everyone who talked about the book on Twitter. I still do that today, and that is, in essence, the only marketing I do. I talk about the book, and I point at people who talk about it.</p><h2 id="did-it-ever-cross-your-mind-that-zero-to-sold-would-be-such-a-hit">Did it ever cross your mind that Zero to Sold would be such a hit?</h2><blockquote>I think Zero to Sold is what it should be: itâ€™s the book I would have loved to read 5 years ago, before I had any real idea about how to start, run, or sell a bootstrapped business.</blockquote><p>When I launched the book, I hoped to sell twenty books on day one, maybe 50. Within the first 24 hours, I sold 350 books, and 1000 within the first week. I never thought the book would be that successful, no.</p><p> But I do recognize that Zero to Sold was an opportunity for many of my followers to finally give something back. I had written valuable content for months, for free. Now here was a chance to say thank you. Many people took that opportunity and showed me their support.</p><h2 id="publishing-is-an-interesting-business-how-were-your-interactions-with-it-the-editing-process-getting-the-book-out-there-etc-">Publishing is an interesting business: how were your interactions with it? (the editing process, getting the book out there, etc.)</h2><p>Once I had finished my first draft, I immediately hired a copy editor from Reedsy and had them work on the book. I knew that I couldnâ€™t â€œjust ship itâ€� â€” after all, this is not a piece of software that can be easily deployed and updated. Once a book is in a bookshelf, it wonâ€™t change. So I had to make sure the quality of the book was high enough from the start. After the copy editing, I had a professional proofreader go through it again. </p><p>All in all, somewhere around 5000 things needed to be changed. I worked in those changes, made sure they still fit my vision, and then I was finally done. I used <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/how-i-self-published-zero-to-sold-a-bestselling-book-on-bootstrapping/">a number of tools</a> to create the print and digital versions from the same source manuscript, which I then uploaded to Amazon KDP and Gumroad, making the book available within a few days as a print-on-demand paperback, as a PDF, and for eReaders.</p><h2 id="would-you-change-anything-in-your-book-if-so-what-would-it-be">Would you change anything in your book? If so, what would it be?</h2><p>I would probably add even more anecdotes, because many people learn best from stories of other peopleâ€™s successes and failures. But the book is already 500 pages, any more and it would become a safety hazard. </p><p>I think Zero to Sold is what it should be: itâ€™s the book I would have loved to read 5 years ago, before I had any real idea about how to start, run, or sell a bootstrapped business.</p><h2 id="what-were-some-of-the-biggest-challenges-that-you-ve-faced-as-an-entrepreneur">What were some of the biggest challenges that you've faced as an entrepreneur?</h2><p><br>Personally, I found that I had the most trouble delegating. This resulted in us never hiring another customer service representative or engineer, both positions that could have helped me while we ran the business. </p><p>As a consequence, I developed severe stress and anxieties, stuff that I am still working on today. <strong>If you value your mental health, consider that finding other people that can help you is a net gain, not a loss.</strong> I write about this kind of self-delusion extensively in Zero to Sold, because I want founders to understand that they can easily fall prey to their own minds, and that theyâ€™re better off understanding the demons they might be facing on their own journey.</p><hr><h2 id="we-found-out-that-you-studied-political-science-and-computer-science-how-has-that-combination-shaped-your-way-of-thinking">We found out that you studied political science and computer science; how has that combination shaped your way of thinking?</h2><p>Computer science and political science both depend on a clear understanding of logic. No matter if youâ€™re looking through a codebase of a political institution, you will find infrastructure, decisions, policies, and consequences. Studying two fields that look at seemingly different topics with a similar underlying foundation has allowed me to work with multiple perspectives in mind at all times. Also, studying a social science teaches you quite quickly that â€œtruthâ€� is a construct, and that everything should be deeply and intentionally inspected before you act on it â€” just like this piece of advice ;)</p><h2 id="how-do-you-balance-the-hustle-and-wellness"><br>How do you balance the hustle and wellness?</h2><p><br>Digital detox vacations and no-screen time blocking have helped me. Taking long walks, best daily, also allows me to unwind and keep my mind â€œaired out.â€� I am always thinking about something work-related, so reading fiction can help pulling myself out of the constant state of working.</p><p>I am a great fan of the Pet Shop Boys. For some reason, their style of pop and dance music just makes me very happy. I often listen to their <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/56Z44BHAMa9GUhHYRyyetP?si=Cz6tFZvdS0Ky1sswaiz_Ww">extensive discography</a> when I need to think.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="closing-question-what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-makers-out-there"><br>Closing question: What advice would you give to other makers out there?</h2><p>Read books. Listen to podcasts. Ask questions. Learn in public. Examine any piece of advice you get, understand where itâ€™s coming from and if it makes sense for you. Donâ€™t fall for promises of quick riches, building a sustainable business takes time. Forge relationships with your audience, understand that theyâ€™re not just your customers, they are the reason for your business to exist.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>So, I’ve been <a href="https://twitter.com/_jan_schulte_/status/1315482456649355265?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking with many software agency owners</a> lately. A common theme in these conversations was always <em>“How do I acquire new clients?”</em>, “Why are prospects not listening to me? When we talk about software development, software developers can relate. They want to work with us, but decision-makers don’t care.”</p>



<p>Can you relate to this? Have you seen this too?</p>



<p>I think it’s essential for you to as well to develop these new customers, right? But what should you do when decision-makers, the C-Level Suite, is not listening to you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why wouldn’t they want software development to be an essential topic in their organization?</p>



<p>Let’s examine this. Other Software Developers listen to you because you speak their language. You can relate to their challenges, how hard it is for them to deliver, how messy deployments are, and that it’s about time to establish more best practices across the team.</p>



<p>But still, why do C-Level folks not care about this? They benefit from that too! Correct. Indirectly, they benefit from more best practices, such as pair programming or code reviews. Indirectly? Software Developers have specific goals. To deliver the new release, fix bugs, and set up reliable workflows. All these goals pay into the overall mission of providing value for their end-users and ensuring its success.</p>



<p>On the other hand, C-Level folks have the same overarching mission, running a successful company, but their concrete goals are different. Whereas a Software developer may measure success based on metrics such as feature work completed in a sprint, or new bug reports per month, the CTO’s and CEO’s look at a different dashboard.</p>



<p>For them, metrics such as ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), decreased costs, and increased team efficiency without hiring new people are essential. That’s how their success is measured.</p>



<p>Now, my question for you is: How do your offerings relate to these metrics? If a CTO wants to decrease costs, how much money can you save them over a quarter, half a year, or a full year? How can you help a CTO to be more successful?</p>



<p>You need to take your current product or offering and tailor benefits for different personas to answer these questions:</p>



<ul><li>How does a developer benefit from your work?&nbsp;</li><li>How does your offering relate to business metrics?</li><li>How can you help CTO’s to influence their business metrics positively?</li></ul>



<p>Then, next time you conduct a discovery call or meeting with a prospect, ask for everybody’s position at the company so you can tailor your arguments and benefits toward their roles and concerns.</p>



<p>So you will demonstrate to your prospect that you understand them and their business as a whole.</p>



<p>Was this helpful? I’d love to hear from you how this strategy helped you in your business. If you need further support with crafting the right messages, get in touch via <a href="https://work-with-jan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://work-with-jan.com</a>! I’m looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>With <a aria-label="#HacktoberFest (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#HacktoberFest</a> being a thing, there has been an influx of devs desperately trying to contribute to their favorite Open-Source projects. Unfortunately, many of these pull requests have been a waste of time, with the maintainers ultimately unable to use the contributions. Maintainers don’t want to waste their time reviewing bad PRs, and contributors don’t want to waste their time writing code that will never make it into production.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some common pitfalls that developers fall prey to when working on an open-source project. As a side note, we recently open-sourced the <a href="https://app.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> front-end, so take a look<a href="https://github.com/qvault/webapp" rel="noopener"> at that</a> if you want to help out.</p>



<h2>1. Pull Requests Should Handle ONE Thing</h2>



<p>Don’t open a PR like this:</p>



<ul><li>Fixes bug #543</li><li>Adds new linting rules</li><li>Includes feature #456</li></ul>



<p>Your PR should do <em>one thing</em>. Small diffs decrease the cognitive load of the reviewer and make it easier to get your code into the main branch. If you have beef with multiple issues in a project then open multiple PRs.</p>



<h2>2. Don’t Break Consistency</h2>



<p>This one happens the most often to me in my own projects. Well-intentioned developers open pull requests with any of the following annoyances:</p>



<ul><li>Omitting semicolons in a project that prefers them</li><li>Using spaces in a project that has clearly been using tabs</li><li>Introducing snake_case in a camelCase repo</li></ul>



<p>When you contribute to an existing project, use the existing styling. No one gives two hoots about your preference on the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI" target="_blank" aria-label="tabs vs spaces (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tabs vs spaces</a>” debate in the context of this pull request.</p>



<p>If you think styling needs to change, see points #1 and #3.</p>



<h2>3. Don’t Start Work Without Approval</h2>



<p>If you hop into a Github repo and find something you don’t like, don’t immediately open a pull request. Follow these steps instead:</p>



<ul><li>Is there already an issue logged? If not, make one.</li><li>If there is an issue, reach out to the maintainers (just comment on the issue) and let them know you want to work on it, and give a quick overview of how you will address it.</li><li>Assuming you have their blessing, start work on your PR.</li></ul>



<p>This will help mitigate the creation of pointless PRs that will never be accepted on the basis of a flawed premise.</p>



<h2>4. Don’t Re-open Known Problems/Solutions</h2>



<p>Some codebases have thousands of open issues, take the <a aria-label="Go language (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/golang/go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Go language</a> project, or the <a aria-label="nocode repository (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nocode repository</a> as an example. No one wants to read your duplicate issue or review your duplicate pull request. Make sure there isn’t an existing open <em>or closed</em> issue for what you are trying to address.</p>



<h2>5. Squash Those Commits</h2>



<p>Not every project will require (or care) about <a aria-label="commit squashing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/How-to-squash-commits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">commit squashing</a>. That said, there are no projects that require <em>not</em> squashing commits. To be on the safe side just give ’em a squash.</p>



<h2>6. Be Meaningful</h2>



<p>Rewording documentation and other frivolous changes make you look like <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aspam" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">these assholes</a>. This particularly <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6075" target="_blank" aria-label="atrocious example (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">atrocious example</a> is not only scoped to pointless documentation changes but actually makes the documentation <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking to try my hand at IC decapsulation for years, and finally got
the time to do it. The process took plenty of trial and error, so this post will
document most of my failures and successes, and detail the methodologies used for
each attempt. These are most of the ICs I worked on throughout the process:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/macro-all-manipulated-ics.jpg" alt="Most ICs I experimented on"></p>

<p>A typical chip is built as a silicon die, connected to its leads/contacts through
bonding wires, and encapsulated in resin for protection.</p>

<p>Of course, there are other ICs that use different designs and encapsulation
materials: mostly metal and plastics. But the epoxy-based design is extremely
common, so we’ll be focusing on it.</p>

<p>This picture of a DIP package -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DIP_package_sideview.PNG">courtesy of Wikipedia</a>-
explains it very well:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/3rd-party/DIP_package_sideview.png" alt="Generic IC diagram"></p>

<p>The decapsulation/decapping of Integrated Circuits, also known as “delidding”, is
nothing new.</p>

<p>It’s used in the industry to debug hardware issues, reverse engineer chips, verify
the authenticity of parts, and other tasks that require access to the underlying
circuitry.</p>

<p>That’s why there’s plenty of commercial services that will decapsulate your ICs
using expensive and dedicated equipment.
I’ve linked a couple of them in <a href="#resources">the bibliography</a>.
But, without having any idea how much they cost or how long they take, I can’t
imagine them being an option for the average hacker.</p>

<p>Hackers and smaller companies generally decap Integrated Circuits to identify
counterfeits, gain a very rudimentary understanding of the parts comprising them,
or just to share the pretty pictures of the silicon die.
For those cases, a DIY process is generally good enough.</p>

<p>Decapping/delidding has also been used by hackers for more fun purposes, such as
<a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=40">unsetting efuses from production hardware to extract and/or override their firmware</a>,
private keys, etc.
So there are cases where a commercial-level result can be worth it.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to try my hand at decapping ICs for years, for no other purpose
than to satiate my curiosity. I’ve finally had the time to get to it, so this
post will describe the methods I tried and the hurdles I encountered.</p>



<p>The biggest factor to decide which method is best for your project is whether
or not you need the chip to still work after it’s been decapsulated. That means
not destroying or disconnecting the die, bonding wires, external contact points,
etc. so you can still use the chip after the process is complete.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the most common options.</p>

<p>Destructive methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.experimental-engineering.co.uk/2016/02/20/ic-decapping-the-process/">Burn the encapsulation to hell</a> using a blowtorch</li>
  <li><a href="http://jg.sn.sg/decap/">Full wet chemical decapsulation</a>: Bath the entire chip in acid to remove all encapsulation, leads, bonds, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-destructive methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selective wet chemical decapsulation:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1707865">Rubber gaskets + acid yet for targetted decapping</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT1FStxAVz4">Manual acid deposition</a>:
Repeatedly apply drops of acid on the IC’s target area, and rinse the acid
residue and weakened encapsulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://bseteq.com/decapsulation/plasma-decap/plaser-plasma-decapsulation-system/">Plasma etching</a>
uses expensive equipment to create plasma, make it react with the encapsulation,
and drain it away</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post we’re gonna focus on the manual acid deposition method, to achieve
non-destructive decapsulation at a reasonable cost.</p>



<p>First of all, let me preface this safety talk with an important disclaimer:
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I’M DOING. My thing is firmware and electronics, not chemistry.</p>

<p>PLEASE, do not assume the safety measures discussed here are valid or enough to
protect yourself. Do your own research, follow any and all measures you deem
appropriate, and remain paranoid all along the process.</p>

<p>We’re dealing with very dangerous chemicals. If you decide to replicate the
experiments it’s at your own peril.</p>

<p>Here are more authoritative sources of safety information for a project like this.
Review as much of this info as you can, and take it with the seriousness it requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://safetyservices.ucdavis.edu/safetynet/safe-use-of-nitric-acid">UCDavis docs on the safe use of nitric acid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/safety-centers-of-expertise-us/respiratory-protection/respirator-selection/">3M respiratory protection selection guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nitric-acid/default.html">CDC resources on the use of nitric acid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftACSEJ6DZA">NileRed’s “Chemistry is Dangerous” introduction to personal protection when working with chemicals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After doing enough research to feel comfortable with the risks involved, I settled
for following these measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run all experiments outside, with all nearby windows closed, and never accessing
the area without using PPE. I might invest in a fume hood in the future, either
commercial or DIY</li>
  <li>Wear chemical splash goggles. They should protect your eyes from droplets
coming from any direction. If they become uncomfortable or fog up, do not remove
them or pull them off your face in the working area</li>
  <li>Wear a respirator mask with filters that are appropriate for chemical fumes.
Preferably a full face mask, to avoid acid splashes</li>
  <li>Wear gloves that are appropriate for the acids you’re dealing with. Nitrile gloves
should NOT be used to work with nitric acid; especially fuming (98%+) nitric acid.
Long, thick neoprene-based gloves are best for Nitric, but make delicate tasks
difficult. I settled for wearing a thick neoprene glove on my non-dominant hand,
and a vinyl glove on my dominant hand for the more delicate work. When touching
any surface that’s hot or has been in touch with acid, I use the neoprene glove</li>
  <li>Expose as little of your skin as possible: Wear shoes, trousers (not shorts),
long sleeves… Preferably use a lab coat, so you can remove the acid-splashed
clothing without dragging it over your face</li>
  <li>Never mix chemicals without fully understanding the outcome to expect. Keep
different chemicals as far apart from each other as possible. Keep the smallest
possible amount of dangerous chemicals in the working area</li>
  <li>Be prepared for the worst:
    <ul>
      <li>Keep enough sodium bicarbonate at hand to neutralize acid spills and leftover acid.
Keep in mind that neutralizing acid with bicarb will give off heat, and the bubbling
could be dangerously vigorous for significant amounts. Expect the possibility of
a spill during the neutralization process</li>
      <li>Keep enough water at hand to dilute chemicals in case of spills, splashes, etc.</li>
      <li>Understand what are the recommended procedures in case of any given chemical
contacting your skin, eyes, etc. Eyes are generally the most sensitive to chemical
splashes, as they can be permanently damaged in seconds; they’re also the most
difficult to clean up, so be particularly careful with them and have a plan of
action in case the worst happens</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/ppe.jpg" alt="Picture of my PPE"></p>



<p>These describe failures and successes, and what I learned along the way.
Keep in mind that most resources I’ve found recommend using fuming nitric acid
(86%+).</p>

<p>I was not able to source fuming nitric acid, so I used concentrated nitric
(69%) instead. That could account for some of the problems I’m about to describe,
but worked fine once I found the most fitting methodology.</p>



<p>Chemicals I used during my experiments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Concentrated (69%) Nitric Acid</li>
  <li>100% Sodium bicarbonate - Bought on Amazon</li>
  <li>98% methanol - From a hardware store</li>
  <li>Acetone - From a hardware store</li>
  <li>Water - Either tap water or regular distilled water from a grocery store</li>
</ol>

<p>I also ran a couple of tests using Sulfuric Acid, both standalone and mixed with
the Nitric, but the results were not very promising. Probably because of the
encapsulation material used in my ICs. These are the acids I used:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/all-chemicals.jpg" alt="Both bottles of acid used during my experiments"></p>

<p>Necessary equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dremel
    <ul>
      <li>I’ve found <a href="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/dremel-diamond-pointy-bit.jpg">this off-brand pointy diamond bit</a>
to work great</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hot plate</li>
  <li>High-temperature and acid safe recipient
    <ul>
      <li>Tried using ceramic recipients and they worked well enough, but it was hard
to maintain a stable temperature outside using my hot plate</li>
      <li>Graphite ingot molds ended up being better at conducting heat (hence
maintaining a reasonably stable temperature outside) and providing easy access
to the IC inside</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plastic tweezers</li>
  <li>A syringe, or preferably an assortment of them</li>
</ol>

<p>Other very useful equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Erlenmeyer flask to keep a small amount of acid in a stable container</li>
  <li>Pipettes:
    <ul>
      <li>10ml pipette to transfer acid from its primary container to the flask</li>
      <li>1ml pipette to drop acid on the ICs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beakers:
    <ul>
      <li>A small one for acetone</li>
      <li>A large one for water, to rinse tools</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thermocouple to monitor the temperature of the hot plate and IC container</li>
  <li>Tongs to move the hot ceramic/graphite container</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic cleaner. Explained later</li>
</ol>

<p>This picture shows most of the equipment used for the most successful method:</p>

of good friends, and we started looking at some random samples. Blood, dust, etc.</p>

<p>Then we decided to take a look at some random IC. We were not looking to
see anything useful or complete; just an overall image of the silicon die in
an IC, so I sanded down a microcontroller and we took a look. The result, as
expected, was absolute garbage:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/micro-sanded-pic.jpg" alt="Micro: Sanded down silicon die"></p>

<p>Well, that went exactly as terribly as expected… Time to go down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>In 2015 I wrote a paper called “<a href="http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/allen_downey.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Millennials Ever Get Married?</a>” where I used data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to estimate the age at first marriage for women in the U.S, broken down by decade of birth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I found that women born in the 1980s and 90s were getting married later than previous cohorts, and I generated projections that suggest they are on track to stay unmarried at substantially higher rates.</p>



<p>Here are the results from that paper, based on 58 488 women surveyed between 1983 to 2015:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3.png 1800w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Percentage of women ever married, based on data up to 2015.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each line represents a cohort grouped by decade of birth.  For example, the top line represents women born in the 1940s.</p>



<p>The colored segments show the fraction of women who had ever been married as a function of age.  For example, among women born in the 1940s, 82% had been married by age 25.  Among women born in the 1980s, only 41% had been married by the same age.</p>



<p>The gray lines show projections I generated by assuming that going forward each cohort would be subject to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#Hazard_function_and_cumulative_hazard_function">hazard function</a> of the previous cohort. This method is likely to overestimate marriage rates.</p>



<p>These results show two trends:</p>



<ul><li>Each cohort is getting married later than the previous cohort.</li><li>The fraction of women who never marry is increasing from one cohort to the next.  </li></ul>



<h3>New data</h3>



<p>Yesterday the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) released a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2017_2019_puf.htm" target="_blank">new batch of data from surveys conducted in 2017-2019</a>. &nbsp;So we can compare the predictions from 2015 with the new data, and generate updated predictions.</p>



<p>The following figure shows the predictions from the previous figure, which are based on data up to 2015, compared to the new curves based on data up to 2019, which includes 70 183 respondents.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4.png 1800w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Percentage of women ever married, based on data up to 2019, <br>compared to predictions based on data up to 2015.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For women born in the 1980s, the fraction who have married is almost exactly as predicted.  For women born in the 1990s, it is substantially lower.  </p>



<h3>New projections</h3>



<p>The following figure shows projections based on data up to 2019.</p>

<p>The vertical dashed lines show the ages where we have the last reliable estimate for each cohort.  The following table summarizes the results at age 28:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 28</td><td>87%</td><td>80%</td><td>70%</td><td>63%</td><td>55%</td><td>31%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 28, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The percentage of women married by age 28 has dropped quickly from each cohort to the next, by about 11 percentage points per decade.  </p>



<p>The following table shows the same percentage at age 38; the last value, for women born in the 1990s, is a projection based on the data we have so far.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 38</td><td>92%</td><td>88%</td><td>85%</td><td>80%</td><td>68%</td><td><em>51%</em></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 38, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on current trends, we expect barely half of women born in the 1990s to be married before age 38.</p>



<p>Finally, here are the percentages of women married by age 48; the last two values are projections.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 48</td><td>&gt;93%</td><td>&gt;90%</td><td>88%</td><td>83%</td><td><em>72%</em></td><td><em>58%</em></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 48, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on current trends, we expect women born in the 1980s and 1990s to remain unmarried at rates substantially higher than previous generations.</p>



<p>Projections like these are based on the assumption that the future will be like the past, but of course, things change.  In particular:</p>



<ul><li>These data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. Marriage rates in 2020 will probably be lower than predicted, and the effect could continue into 2021 or beyond.</li><li>However, as economic conditions improve in the future, marriage rates might increase.</li></ul>



<p>We’ll find out when we get the next batch of data in October 2022.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preface</h2>
<p>My goal for this article is to help you solve technical interview problems
similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate all subsets of a given set</li>
<li>Generate all strings over a given alphabet of a given fixed length</li>
<li>Generate all strings over a given alphabet (of any length)</li>
<li>Generate all permutations of a given set</li>
<li>Generate all combinations of a given length and a given set</li>
<li>Generate all balanced parentheses of a given length</li>
<li>Generate all binary trees with a given number of nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems fall under the category of "combinatorial generation" problems,
since you are asked to generate all the elements of a set of combinatorial
objects (subsets, strings, combinations, permutations, trees, graphs, etc.).</p>
<p>The topic of combinatorial generation is a rich field of study and here I do
not intend to do it any real justice. For rigorous and much more comprehensive
treatments of the subject I recommend Knuth's or Ruskey's books on the subject.
See the Further Reading section for references. Instead, I intend to provide
a bare minimum, approachable, and practical guide that will prepare you to
approach combinatorial generation problems you might encounter during coding
interviews, and to provide you with the basic tools and vocabulary needed to
analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.</p>
<p>I chose to write this post for several reasons. First, I noticed combinatorial
generation problems are commonly asked during coding interviews. I myself have
been asked variations of combinatorial generation problems on at least six or
seven coding interviews that I remember. I suspect their popularity as
interview questions has to do with the fact that most of the problems have
fairly simple and elegant solutions that are well within reach during a
45-minute coding interview. However, reaching any elegant solution requires
clarity of thought, good pattern recognition, a solid understanding of
recursion, as well as solid coding skills, in particular comfortable handling
of indexes, and general list or string manipulation. There are often many ways
of solving a problem, with different levels of space and time complexity
trade-off. All of this leads to a problem area that is well-suited for gauging
a candidates overall algorithmic thinking and coding aptitude.</p>
<p>Second, the topic is often not given proper treatment as part of most computer
science programs. Because of this, I noticed most candidates are somewhat
ill-prepared to solve problems in this space. While some students might have
encountered a few examples in the space as part of recursion or backtracking
topics, the problems are almost never given focused attention by themselves.
This article is meant to fill that gap.</p>
<p>Third, I believe the subject matter to be a fantastic playground for exploring
ideas and learning more about coding, combinatorics, algorithms, recursion, and
time and space complexity analysis, for reasons very similar to those making
the subject area a good fit for coding interview questions. As such,
combinatorial generation problems provide an excellent excuse to practice and
hone coding and algorithmic skills. This article is intended to be an
invitation to this playground, providing an approachable and gentle
introduction using very readable code in Python.</p>
<p>To make the post useful and practical, I start by providing a brief description
of two approaches to solving combinatorial generation problems, and then dive
into multiple examples, applying both approaches to each example and then
briefly discussing the time and space complexity of each solution. I also
provide many exercises as we progress to give you an opportunity to challenge
yourself and test your understanding of the material.</p>
<!-- I recommend you try to solve the example problems on your own before reading my -->
<!-- solutions, or at least go back and try to implement the solutions from memory -->
<!-- and based on your understanding afterwards, without looking at the source code -->
<!-- I provide. Ultimately, as Feynman said, you do not really understand it unless -->
<!-- you can create it yourself. -->

<div id="preliminaries">
<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminaries</h2>
<div id="two-approaches-to-combinatorial-generation">
<h3>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Approaches To Combinatorial Generation</h3>
<p>In this post we will look at two approaches to solving combinatorial generation
problems. Let's consider both of them here briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Recursive</strong>: The problems you are likely to encounter during coding
interviews are very likely to have very simple recursive solutions. The
recursive solution is often based on simple observations about the recursive
structure of the combinatorial set you are generating. At times, the recursive
solution can be as simple as literally following the definition of the
combinatorial set. Combinatorial objects are often defined recursively, for
example, consider the definition of a binary tree. The recursive solutions
often suffer from exponential space usage (or exponential time, or both,
depending on implementation). However, they are often very very simple to
implement, requiring minimal code and are also readable and easy to understand.
As such, you should make sure you master the basic recursive solutions and
provide them as the first solution.  This way you will have at least one
working solution by the end of the interview (which will, in my experience of
interviewing candidates, set you apart from the majority of candidates).
Ideally, you should aim to provide a simple recursive solution in 5 to 10
minutes at most, leaving the majority of the rest of the interview time to
space and time complexity analysis and to provide the improved iterative
solution.</p>
<p><strong>Iterative</strong>: In the iterative approach, we move from one object to the next
by modifying the object in-place. A common iterative approach is to generate
all objects in lexicographic order. This approach has several benefits. First,
since the generation is done by modifying the input in-place, space complexity
is often constant or at least not exponential.  Second, it produces the objects
in lexicographic order, meaning the output objects are guaranteed to be in
sorted order. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as how to move from one
object to the next in lexicographic order, we can come up with a general
problem solving strategy that works for many problems. To quote Knuth,
"lexicographic order usually suggests the most convenient way to generate
combinatorial configurations" (The Art Of Computer Programming, Volume 4,
section 7.2.1.3).</p>
<p>We will approach multiple example problems using both the above approaches and
analyze their time and space complexity. Hopefully by the end of the article,
both approaches will be second nature to you and provide systematic way of
approaching any combinatorial generation problem you might encounter.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-and-space-complexity-of-generation-algorithms">
<h3>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time And Space Complexity Of Generation Algorithms</h3>
<p>Time and space complexity analysis is slightly different for combinatorial
generation problems. In most cases, the output is exponential in size (or
infinite at times), and hence as a whole the program must run in exponential
time to generate all the objects (or run indefinitely until terminated
externally, in cases of generating infinite sets). Because of this, we will
often consider time needed to generate <em>each</em> object in the set (on average, or
worst case). Similarly, we will look at the maximum space needed by the program
at any point during its execution. For programs that need to run indefinitely
(i.e., ones that generate infinite sets), we look at how space usage grows as
the program keeps on running.</p>
<p>Similar to the two approaches to solving the problems, this more nuanced
approach to time and space complexity will also be made more clear by looking
at multiple examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-generate-means">
<h3>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What "Generate" Means</h3>
<p>It is important at this point to clarify what we mean by "generate". The
simplest way to generate the objects is to simply put all the output into a
list or in-memory collection of some sort and returned that collection.
However, we obviously can not improve space complexity to be better than the
size of the output set (which is often exponential), if we want to keep all the
generated objects in memory at once. Therefore, for the purposes of problems
like this, "generate" can mean any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the resulting objects all in a list and return the list.</li>
<li>Print a representation of each object to standard output.</li>
<li>Yield each object using a generator.</li>
<li>Visit each object by calling a provided <tt>visit</tt> function with the object
passed as the argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, when we try to avoid unnecessary (and often exponential)
memory usage, we will use a simple generator pattern and yield each resulting
object instead of placing them in an in-memory collection. You read about
Python's generators in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">PEP 255</a>.
As the name of the pattern suggests, Python generators are very well-suited for
combinatorial generation.</p>
</div>
<div id="output-order">
<h3>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output Order</h3>
<p>A good clarifying question to ask for combinatorial generation problems is
whether there is an expectation on the order of the output objects. You might
learn that the output order does not matter, or the interviewer might ask the
output to be in lexicographic (i.e., dictionary) order. Rarely, you might also
come across a problem that asks for an order that minimizes the difference
between two subsequent objects. This order is often referred to as Gray order,
named after Bell Labs researcher Frank Gray. I hope to write a follow-up to
this post at some point to go over some examples of Gray order generation. For
now, in our basic recursive solutions we tend to not worry about the order of
the output, and just ensure every object is generated exactly once. For our
second approach, we, by definition of the approach, only generate objects in
lexicographic order.</p>
</div>

<div id="fixed-length-strings-given-an-alphabet">
<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed Length Strings Given An Alphabet</h2>
<div id="problem-definition">
<h3>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem Definition</h3>
<p>Let's start by looking at a simple problem: given an alphabet <tt>A</tt> which is

non-negative integer <tt>n</tt>, generate all strings of length <tt>n</tt>. For
example, given <tt>A = ['0', '1', '2']</tt> and <tt>n = 2</tt> we expect the output to be:</p>

<title>The Myth of RAM, part I</title>
# The Myth of RAM, part I
<p id="date">April 21, 2014</p>


## Preface
This article is the first of four in a series, in which I argue that thinking of a memory access as _O(1)_ is generally a bad idea, and we should instead think of them as taking _O(√N)_ time. In part one I lay out a hand-wavy argument based on a benchmark. In [part II](2014_04_28_myth_of_ram_2.html) I build up a mathematical argument based in theoretical physics, and in [part III](2014_04_29_myth_of_ram_3.html) I investigate some implications. [Part IV](2015_02_09_myth_of_ram_4.html) is a FAQ in which I answers some common questions and misunderstandings.

(This preface was added on August 29, 2016)


## Intro
If you have studied computing science, then you know how to do [complexity analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms#Run-time_analysis). You'll know that the time complexity for iterating through a linked list is _O(N)_, binary search is _O(log(N))_ and a hash table lookup is _O(1)_. What if I told you that all of the above is not just misleading, but wrong? What if I told you that the time it takes to iterate through a linked list is actually _O(N√N)_ and hash lookups are _O(√N)_?

Don't believe me? By the end of this series of articles you will. I will show you that accessing memory is not a _O(1)_ operation but _O(√N)_. This is a result that holds up both in theory and practice. Let’s start with the latter:



## Measuring it
First of all, let's get our definitions straight. [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) can be applied to many things, from memory usage to instructions executed. For the purpose of this series of articles I'll be using the _O(f(N))_ to mean that _f(N)_ is an upper bound (worst case) of the *time* it takes to accomplish a task accessing _N_ bytes of memory (or, equivalently, _N_ number of equally sized elements). That I use Big O to analyze _time_ and not _operations_ is important. As we'll see, the CPU spends a lot of time waiting for memory. Personally, I do not care what the CPU does while I wait for it – I only care about how long something takes, hence the definition above.

Another clarification: the "RAM" in the title is meant to refer to random memory accesses in general, not to a specific type of memory. In this installment I measure the time it takes to access a piece of memory be it in cache, in DRAM, or in swap. In Part II I will extend this even further – but I'm getting ahead of myself.

[Here’s a simple program](https://github.com/emilk/ram_bench) that iterates through a linked list of length _N_, ranging from 64 elements up to about 420 million elements. Each node consists of a 64 bit pointer and 64 bits of dummy data. The nodes of the linked list are jumbled around in memory so that each memory access is random. I measure iterating through the same list a few times, and then plot the time taken per element. This means that we should get a flat plot if random memory access is _O(1)_. This is what we actually get:

![The cost of accessing one node in a linked list of a given size. Accessing a random element in a 100MB list is approximately 100 times slower than accessing an element in a 10kB list.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/1_data.png)

Note that this is a log-log graph, so the differences are actually pretty huge. We go from about one nanosecond per element all they way up to a microsecond! But why? The answer, of course, is caching. The system memory (RAM) is actually pretty slow and far away and so to compensate the clever computer designers have added a hierarchy of faster, closer and more expensive caches to speed things up. My computer has three levels called L1, L2, L3 of 32 kiB, 256 kiB and 4 MiB each. I have 8 GiB of RAM, but when I ran my experiment I only had about 6 GiB free – so in the last runs there was some swapping to disk (an SSD). Here’s the same plot again but with my RAM and cache sizes added as vertical lines:

![The vertical lines corresponds to L1=32kiB, L2=256kiB, L3=4MiB and 6 GiB of free RAM.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/2_caches.png)

This graph should really drive home the importance of cache:s – each cache is many times faster than the previous one. This is the reality of modern CPU architectures, be it on smartphones, laptops or mainframes. But what is the pattern? Can we fit some simple equation to the plot? It turns out we can! If you look at the plot you'll see that between 10kB and 1MB there is a roughly a 10x slowdown. Between 1 MB and 100 MB there is another 10x slowdown – and again between 100 MB and 10 GB! It seems like that for each 100-fold increase in memory usage we get a 10-fold slow-down. Let's superimpose that on the graph:

![The blue line is _O(√N)_.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/3_fit.png)

The blue line corresponds to a _O(√N)_ cost of each memory access. Seems like a pretty good fit, no? Of course this is on my machine, and it may look quite different on yours. Still, the equation is very simple to remember, so maybe we could use it as a rule of thumb.

You may now wonder what will happen once we hit the right side of the graph. Will it keep climbing, or plateauing? Well, it would plateau for a while until we could no longer fit the memory on SSD and would need to go to HDD, then a disk server, then a data-center far away etc. Each such jump would create a new plateau, but the upwards trend of the latency, I will argue, would continue. The reason I did not run my experiment further is simply lack of time and lack of access to a big data-center.

"But", I hear you say, "empiricism is no way to establish a Big-O bound!". It certainly isn't! Could there perhaps be a theoretical limit to the latency of a memory access? The plot thickens in [The Myth of RAM, part II](2014_04_28_myth_of_ram_2.html).

    <blockquote>
  <p>If at first you don’t succeed, call it version 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RuboCop’s development started exactly 7 and half years ago. I made
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/commit/afbead34db54506c12a21dbd4ce04fada0f8b9a4#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947">the first
commit</a>
on April 21, 2012. That’s a lot of time in general, but even more in
the fast moving world of IT. During this long period we’ve racked up some
impressive numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9905</strong> commits</li>
  <li><strong>152</strong> releases</li>
  <li>around <strong>3500</strong> closed issues</li>
  <li>almost <strong>5000</strong> merged pull requests</li>
  <li>over <strong>120 million</strong> downloads</li>
  <li>over <strong>200</strong> publicly available related gems (extensions, custom configurations, etc)</li>
  <li>over <strong>700</strong> contributors</li>
</ul>

<p>I never expected any of this on April 21, 2012. If there’s a person truly
surprised by the success of RuboCop that’d be me. But wait, there’s more!
We also reached some important milestones in the last couple of years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq">RuboCop HQ organization</a> that became the home for RuboCop, the community style guides, and many popular RuboCop extensions</li>
  <li>Extracted the Rails cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-rails</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the performance cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-performance</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the AST-related functionality to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-ast</code>)</li>
  <li>Created new extensions focused on Rake (<code>rubocop-rake</code>) and Minitest (<code>rubocop-minitest</code>)</li>
  <li>Made significant improvements to RuboCop’s code formatting capabilities</li>
  <li>Reworked the cop API</li>
  <li>Switched to safe-only cops by default</li>
  <li>Introduced the notion of “pending” cops</li>
  <li>Created a brand new <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">documentation site</a></li>
  <li>Provided more polished versions of the community style guides over at <a href="https://rubystyle.guide/">https://rubystyle.guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing eluded us, though - a “stable” RuboCop release. Today this finally changes with
RuboCop 1.0!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There’s nothing ground-breaking about the new RuboCop release - it’s almost the same as RuboCop 0.93.1 that
preceded it. I believe the only change, that most of you are going to notice, is that all cops that used to be
“pending” are now enabled by default, which is in line with our release policy. No new cops will be enabled
by default until RuboCop 2.0.</p>

<p>The big news for end users and maintainers of extensions is that we’re finally embracing fully Semantic Versioning, which
should make the upgrade process simpler (painless?) for everyone. Going forward the following things will happen only on major releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabling of new cops</li>
  <li>changes to the default cop configuration</li>
  <li>breaking API changes</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s really funny that I felt for at least a couple of years that we were very close to the 1.0
release, only to come up with more and more things I wanted to include in it. I believe <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2018/presentations/bbatsov.html">I first spoke</a>
about my intentions to ship RuboCop 1.0 at RubyKaigi 2018 and back then I truly believed this was bound to happen in the next
6 months. Classic example of planning in the software development world, right?</p>

<p>Many people urged me for years to label a random release as 1.0 with
the argument that if some software is useful and widely used than it
probably deserves that magic moniker. It’s not a bad argument and I
totally understood the perspective of those people. I, however, was
not convinced as for me version 1.0 also stands for “we got to a place
we consider feature complete and aligned with our vision”.  Needless
to say - the vision we (RuboCop’s team) had was quite ambitious and it took us
a while to make it a reality.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to explain how happy I am that we got here, and I can
assure you that it wasn’t easy.  Over the years RuboCop had its ups
and downs, it got a lot of praise, but also a lot of flak.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Some
days I was super pumped and motivated to work on it, on other days I
couldn’t stand to think about it.  Working on popular OSS projects is
one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences that one
can have.  I was (un)fortunate enough to be involved in a few of those
(RuboCop, CIDER, nREPL, Projectile, Emacs Prelude, etc) and each one
was a crazy roller-coaster ride.</p>

<p>I find it funny how my role in RuboCop evolved with time. Originally I
used to write mostly code, these days I write mostly tickets,
issue/code review comments and documentation. Often I feel more like a
project manager rather than a programmer. There was a time when I was
super happy to see a PR and I’d immediately respond to it, now I can’t
keep up with all the PRs. In fact, our entire team can’t keep up with
them, so consider this my apology that it sometimes takes a while to
get feedback on your suggestions. I’ll even admit that I rarely read
issue tickets these days as there are so many of them and it’s
impossible for me to respond to all of them. I’ve just learned that
important tickets always get noticed, if not by me than by someone else from our
fantastic team.</p>

<p>I want to extend special thanks to RuboCop’s core team, as we would have never gotten so far without all those amazing people
working tirelessly on the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jonas054">Jonas Arvidsson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yujinakayama">Yuji Nakayama</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/edzhelyov">Evgeni Dzhelyov</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/drenmi">Ted Johansson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pocke">Masataka Kuwabara</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/koic">Koichi Ito</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/darhazer">Maxim Krizhanovski</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bquorning">Benjamin Quorning</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marcandre">Marc-André Lafortune</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You rock, guys!</p>

<p>Jonas, in particular, deserves just as much credit for RuboCop existing today as me. He was the first contributor to RuboCop and he
pushed me to get RuboCop to the state where it got critical mass, mindshare and some traction. It’s a long story for another day and another article.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Koichi also deserves a special mention for his tireless work and incredible dedication to RuboCop and its users over the years! And for his great karaoke skills!
He has also been a fantastic head maintainer for key RuboCop extensions like <code>rubocop-rails</code>, <code>rubocop-performance</code> and <code>rubocop-minitest</code>.</p>

<p>Last, but not least - another round of big thanks for all the people who contributed to RuboCop in any capacity over the years! RuboCop is all of you!
Keep those contributions coming!</p>

<p>Some closing notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned above, recently we’ve extracted RuboCop’s AST-related logic to the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-ast">rubocop-ast</a> gem, that’s going to be very handy for everything looking to supercharge
<a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">parser</a>’s API. I’d love to see more tools using it, as I think we really managed to simplify the interaction with an AST. Work on the new gem is led by the awesome Marc-André Lafortune. By the way, he released <code>rubocop-ast</code> 1.0 today! We have some cause for double celebration!</li>
  <li>The cop API was completely reworked recently by Marc-André. He did some truly fantastic work there! Check out the <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/v1_upgrade_notes.html">upgrade notes</a> if you maintain any RuboCop extensions, as the legacy API will be removed
in RuboCop 2.0.</li>
  <li>We’ve made some changes to how department names are calculated that might affect some extensions. Read more about them <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8490">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release notes</a> for all the details.</li>
  <li><code>rubocop-rspec</code> is currently not compatible with RuboCop 1.0, but we’re working on this. You can follow the progress on that front <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec/issues/1051">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s a wrap!</p>

<p>I feel a bit sorry for disappointing everyone who hoped we’d make it
to RuboCop 0.99, before cutting RuboCop 1.0. We did our best and we
had a great 0.x run, but we ran out of things to do.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> :-) On the bright side - now
I can finally say that I’ve got 99 problems (and 200 open issues), but cutting RuboCop 1.0 ain’t one.</p>

<p>Enjoy RuboCop 1.0 and share with us your feedback about it! Our focus now shifts to RuboCop 1.1, and I hope that we’ll be dropping
new major releases rather infrequently going forward (although RuboCop 2.0 will probably arrive in less than 7 years). Thanks for your help, love, feedback and
support! Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Koichi recently covered in great details our long journey to RuboCop 1.0 in his presentation <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/koic/road-to-rubocop-1-dot-0">Road to RuboCop 1.0</a> at RubyKaigi 2020. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those of you who’d like to learn more about the technical aspects of RuboCop 1.0 and all the challenges we had to solve along the way!</p>

<p>It’s very easy to reverse a video using FFmpeg because FFmpeg has a built-in <code>reverse</code> filter that can do this job for both audio and video! Let’s learn how in this tutorial and some gotcha’s that you should avoid. </p>



<h2>Reverse a Video using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Here it is! A simple one-liner that takes your video and reverses it. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i originalVideo.mp4 -vf reverse reversedVideo.mp4</code></code></pre>



<p>And if you want to reverse the audio and video, all you gotta do is use this command.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe <code><code><code>-i originalVideo.mp4 -vf reverse -af areverse reversedVideo.mp4</code></code></code></code></pre>



<p>It’s as simple as that. </p>



<p>I used it on the Parkjoy sequence downloaded from <a aria-label="xiph (opens in a new tab)" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xiph</a>. Note, that the original video is in <code>y4m</code> format and I first transcoded it to H.264/AVC using <code>crf=1</code> and then added timestamps for this fun experiment. </p>



<p>If you want to learn how to add timestamps to your video using the <code>drawtext</code> filter, then <a href="https://ottverse.com/ffmpeg-drawtext-filter-dynamic-overlays-timecode-scrolling-text-credits/">read this tutorial on OTTVerse.com</a>. </p>



<p>Here is the original sequence </p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470236838" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>







<p>And here is the reversed sequence – fun right? </p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470236943" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>







<h2>Caution for Large Files</h2>



<p>The problem with the <code>reverse</code> filter is that it loads the sequence into memory and if you try this on large sequences, you could very easily run out of memory. </p>



<p>The solution for this is to split your video into small pieces or segments, reverse each of them, and join them in the reverse order (yea, remember that!). </p>



<p>If you don’t know how to cut a video into small pieces, check out our <a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="tutorial on trimming or cutting videos (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial on trimming or cutting videos</a>. </p>

The answer is pretty obvious. Open Source rules the world and is a thriving example of how communities can collaborate to build incredible quality products in the open. Such values as transparency, quality, security, and collaboration have been Mudita’s core values from day one. There’s simply no other way for us to release software as to be transparent and open about it. There are many Open Source enthusiasts at Mudita and without Open Source community, we would never be able to make the company happen in the first place.</p><p>Our community has only reassured us that they value the principles of open software - here’s just a few of the quotes from the <a href="https://forum.mudita.com/t/open-source-muditaos/648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MuditaOS - Open Source topic on our forum</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Not going full FOSS (copyleft licenses) with all the community-based advantages (R&amp;D, promotion, bug fixing, trust on privacy, possible leading OS, etc.) would definitely be a huge and sad mistake for this well-thought project. - agent_libre</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Another great aspect would be allowing people to exchange code with Mudita on tools like GitHub. Open source community could even help you in making the product better and better, meet more individual needs, help in debugging, and the most important, allow us to stay free. - darkponay</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>As far as I am concerned, Mudita is not here to build up yet another technological jail; it’s about providing by default a benevolent, useful and non-attention-seeking framework - a caring philosophy, not another mind’s prison. - agent_libre</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>There are also those who believe that non-free software is inherently unethical and I think that’s a respectable point of view, especially when it comes to a device as necessary for daily life as a cellphone. - Matt_McArthur</em></p></blockquote><p>In terms of licensing, we decided to go for <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPL v3 (GNU General Public License v3.0)</a>. This is a strong copyleft license which obliges anyone who introduces changes to the code or uses the code for their own purposes in any form to make the complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, to be available in the open under the same license.</p><h3>Join the MuditaOS Developer Preview</h3><p>The MuditaOS code will be publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/mudita/MuditaOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> on the day we officially launch Mudita Pure and start shipping our phones to backers and customers. Before we go all out, we would like to invite our community for a Developer Preview of the code and documentation.</p><p>While you’re reading this blog post, we’re preparing the necessary infrastructure, guidelines, and spaces for the MuditaOS community to grow. We would love all Mudita community Open Source enthusiasts to <a href="https://choosemindfully.typeform.com/to/dx9opXx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for the Developer Preview.</a> The number of places is limited - so register while you can. After you apply with your email you’ll receive a message explaining the next step.</p><p>During the Developer Preview, we’ll be asking you for feedback regarding our Open Source infrastructure, documentation, guides, etc. so that we can act on and be well prepared for the “Go live with Open Source” day.</p><p>What’s worth mentioning is that <strong>we'll award 10 of the most active Open Source contributors with a free Mudita Pure phone</strong> as soon as we'll be able to ship them. We reserve the freedom to subjectively decide which 10 community members were the most valuable contributors during the Developer Preview period. Contributions include documentation changes, bug fixes, and helping our team on creating and delivering features.

We want our whole community to celebrate the fact that we are going Open Source. This is why <strong>we have added an </strong><code><strong>opensource</strong></code><strong> -5% discount code</strong> available to use until the end of October inside our online store, on top of the existing discounts.</p><p>We hope that you’re as excited as we are about starting this Open Source journey! We look forward to working with you on the best possible operating system for Mudita Pure.</p><div><section><h3>Comments <span>(<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></h3><span>No comments here.

<blockquote><p><strong>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) offers a philosophy for operating reliable distributed systems, with admirable principles and practices. However, in only a few years SRE cargo culting has emerged at a level to rival DevOps cargo culting in the 2010s.&nbsp;<p>What is SRE as a Cult, and how does it intersect with DevOps as a Cult? Why is SRE so difficult to apply to enterprise organisations with IT as a A Cost Centre? Why is an emphasis on operability more important to IT performance than SRE?</p></strong></p></blockquote>



<h3>Introduction&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A successful Digital transformation is predicated on a transition from <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/it-as-a-cost-centre/">IT as a Cost Centre</a> to <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/it-as-a-business-differentiator/">IT as a Business Differentiator</a>. An IT cost centre creates segregated Delivery and Operations teams, trapped in an endless conflict between speed and reliability. Delivery wants to maximise deployments, to increase speed. Operations wants to minimise deployments, to increase reliability. This results in low performance IT, and has negative consequences for profitability, market share, and productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9F83WM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Accelerate</em></a>, Dr Nicole Forsgren <em>et al</em> demonstrates speed and reliability are not a zero sum game. Investing in both Continuous Delivery and Operability will produce a high performance IT capability that can uncover new product revenue streams. For instance, transforming production support from <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-ops-runs-it/">You Build It Ops Run It</a> to <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-you-run-it/">You Build It You Run It</a> will unlock daily deployments, and have a positive impact on service reliability. User satisfaction, revenue protection, and brand reputation will all be improved.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>SRE as a Philosophy</h3>



<p>In 2004, Ben Treynor Sloss started an initiative called SRE within Google. He later described SRE as a software engineering approach to IT operations, with developers automating work historically owned outside Google by sysadmins. SRE key concepts include:</p>



<ul><li>Availability levels.</li><li>Service Level Objectives.</li><li>Error budgets.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-sre-run-it">You Build It SRE Run It</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Availability levels are known by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability" target="_blank">nines of availability</a>. 99.0% is two nines, 99.999% is five nines. 100% availability is unachievable, as less reliable user devices will limit the user experience. 100% is also undesirable, as maximising availability limits speed of feature delivery and increases operational costs. In the seminal book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/introduction/" target="_blank"><em>Site Reliability Engineering</em></a>, Betsey Byers <em>et al</em> observe that ‘an additional nine of reliability requires an order of magnitude more engineering effort’. At any availability level, an amount of unplanned downtime needs to be tolerated, in order to invest in feature delivery.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels.png 960w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-300x169.png 300w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-768x432.png 768w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-676x380.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a published target range of measurements, which sets user expectations on an aspect of service performance. A product manager chooses SLOs, based on their own risk tolerance. They have to balance the engineering cost of meeting an SLO with user needs, the revenue potential of the service, and competitor offerings. An availability SLO could be a median request success rate of 99.9% in 24 hours, with measurements collected every minute for 24 hours as a Service Level Indicator (SLI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>An error budget is a quarterly amount of tolerable, unplanned downtime for a service. It is used to mitigate any inter-team conflicts between product teams and SRE teams, as found in You Build It Ops Run It. It is calculated as 100% minus the chosen nines of availability. For example, an availability level of 99.9% equates to an error budget of 0.01% unsuccessful requests. 0.002% of failing requests in a week would consume 20% of the error budget, and leave 80% for the quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You Build It SRE Run It is a conditional production support method, where a team of SREs support a service for a product team. All product teams do You Build It You Run It by default, and there are strict entry and exit criteria for an SRE team. A service must have a critical level of user traffic, some elevated SLOs, and pass a readiness review. The SREs will take over on-call, and ensure SLOs are consistently met. The product team can launch new features if the service is within its error budget. If not, they cannot deploy until any errors are resolved. If the error budget is repeatedly blown, the SRE team can hand on-call back to the product team, who revert to You Build It You Run It.</p>



<p>This is <strong>SRE as a Philosophy</strong>. The biggest gift from SRE is a framework for quantifying availability targets and engineering effort, based on product revenue. SRE has also promoted ideas such as measuring partial availability, monitoring the golden signals of a service, building SLO alerts and SLI dashboards from the same telemetry data, and reducing operational toil where possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>SRE as a Cult</h3>



<p>In the 2010s, the DevOps philosophy of collaboration was bastardised by <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/aim-for-operability-not-devops-as-a-cult/">DevOps as a Cult</a>. The DevOps cargo cult is ubiquitous, and wrong. Its beliefs are:</p>



<ol><li>The divide between Delivery and Operations teams is <em>always</em> the constraint in IT performance.&nbsp;</li><li>DevOps automation tools, DevOps engineers, DevOps teams, and/or DevOps certifications are <em>always</em> solutions to that problem.</li></ol>



<p>In a similar vein, the SRE philosophy has been corrupted by <strong>SRE as a Cult</strong>. The SRE cargo cult is based on the same flawed premise, and espouses SRE error budgets, SRE engineers, SRE teams, and SRE certifications as a panacea. Examples include Patrick Hill stating in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/devops/sre" target="_blank">Love DevOps? Wait until you meet SRE</a> that ‘SRE removes the conjecture and debate over what can be launched and when’, and the DevOps Institute offering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://devopsinstitute.com/certifications/sre-foundation/" target="_blank">SRE certification</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SRE as a Cult ignores the central question facing the SRE philosophy – its applicability to IT as a Cost Centre. SRE originated from talented, opinionated software engineers in a single, unique organisation. Google has IT as a Business Differentiator as a core tenet. Using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22" target="_blank"><em>A Typology of Organisational Cultures</em></a> by Ron Westrum, its organisational culture can be described as generative. <em>Accelerate</em> found a generative culture is predictive of high performance IT, and less employee burnout.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum.png 960w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-300x169.png 300w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-768x432.png 768w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-676x380.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>There are fundamental challenges with applying SRE to an IT as a Cost Centre organisation with a bureaucratic or pathological culture. Product, Delivery, and Operations teams will be hindered by orthogonal incentives, funding pressures, and silo rivalries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Availability levels are a leading indicator of cross-organisation support for SRE. When failure leads to scapegoating or justice:</p>



<ul><li>Heads of Product/Delivery/Operations might not agree 100% reliability is unachievable.</li><li>Heads of Product/Delivery/Operations might not accept an additional nine of reliability means an order of magnitude more engineering effort.&nbsp;</li><li>Heads of Delivery/Operations might not consent to availability levels being owned by product managers.</li></ul>



<p>Service Level Objectives are based on the risk tolerances of product managers. When responsibilities are shirked or discouraged:</p>



<ul><li>Product managers might decline to take on responsibility for service availability.</li><li>Product managers will need help from Delivery teams to uncover user expectations, calculate service revenue potential, and check competitor availability levels.</li><li>Sysadmins might object to developers wiring automated, fine-grained measurements into their own production alerts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Error budgets depend on shared agreements between different teams, without resorting to the inter-team battles of You Build It Ops Run It. When cooperation is modest or low:</p>



<ul><li>Product manager/developers/sysadmins might disagree on availability levels and the maths behind &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; error budgets.</li><li>Heads of Product/Development might not accept a block on deployments when an error budget is 0%.</li><li>A Head of Operations might not accept deployments at all hours when an error budget is above 0%.</li><li>Product managers/developers might accuse sysadmins of blocking deployments unnecessarily</li><li>Sysadmins might accuse product managers/developers of jeopardising reliability</li><li>A Head of Operations might arbitrarily block production deployments</li><li>A Head of Development might escalate a block on production deployments</li><li>A Head of Product might override a block on production deployments</li></ul>



<p>You Build It SRE Run It means a central developer team supporting services with high availability levels and critical user traffic, while other developer teams support their own services under You Build It You Run It. It is worlds apart from You Build It Ops Run It. When bridging is merely tolerated or discouraged:</p>



<ul><li>A Head of Operations might not consent to on-call Delivery teams on their opex budget</li><li>A Head of Development might not consent to on-call Delivery teams on their capex budget</li><li>A Head of Operations might be unable to afford months of software engineering training for their sysadmins on an opex budget</li><li>Sysadmins might not want to undergo training, or be rebadged as SREs</li><li>Developers might not want to do on-call for their services, or be rebadged as SREs</li><li>Delivery teams will find it hard to collaborate with an Operations SRE team on errors and incident management</li><li>A Head of Operations might be unable to transfer an unreliable service back to the original Delivery team, if it was disbanded when its capex funding ended&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In <em>Site Reliability Engineering</em>, Ben Treynor Sloss identifies SRE recruitment as a significant challenge for Google. Developers are needed that excel in both software engineering and systems administration, which is rare. He counters this with the argument that an SRE team is cheaper than an Operations team, as the headcount is reduced by task automation. Recruitment challenges will be exacerbated in IT as a Cost Centre organisations, due to much smaller recruitment budgets. The touted headcount benefit is absurd, as salary rates are invariably higher for developers than sysadmins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Aim for Operability, not SRE as a Cult</h3>



<p>Continuous Delivery requires operational excellence. Reliable production services will minimise operational rework, and increase the throughput of feature delivery. There are many pathways to Operability, and SRE is only one of those pathways. SRE as a Cult will promote the world …</p></div></div>

<p>There is an obvious reason to choose Julia:</p>
<blockquote><p>it's faster than other scripting languages, allowing you to have the rapid development of Python/MATLAB/R while producing code that is as fast as C/Fortran</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newcomers to Julia might be a little wary of that statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not just make other scripting languages faster? If Julia can do it, why can't others? </li>
<li>How do you interpert Julia benchmarks to confirm this? (This is surprisingly difficult for many!)</li>
<li>That sounds like it violates the No-Free-Lunch heuristic. Is there really nothing lost?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people believe Julia is fast <strong>because it is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled</strong> (i.e. every statement is run using compiled functions which are either compiled right before they are used, or cached compilations from before). This leads to questions about what Julia gives over JIT'd implementations of Python/R (and MATLAB by default uses a JIT). These JIT compilers have been optimized for far longer than Julia, so why should we be crazy and believe that somehow Julia quickly out-optimized all of them? However, that is a complete misunderstanding of Julia. What I want show, in a very visual way, is that Julia is fast because of its design decisions. The core design decision, <strong>type-stability through specialization via multiple-dispatch</strong> is what allows Julia to be very easy for a compiler to make into efficient code, but also allow the code to be very concise and "look like a scripting language". This will lead to some very clear performance gains.</p>
<p>But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some "lunches lost" that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.</p>
<p>To see the difference, we only need to go as far as basic math.</p>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Arithmetic-in-Julia">Arithmetic in Julia<a href="#Arithmetic-in-Julia">¶</a></h2><p>In general, math in Julia looks the same as in other scripting languages. One detail to note is that the numbers are "true numbers", as in a <code>Float64</code> is truly the same thing as a 64-bit floating point number or a "double" in C. A <code>Vector{Float64}</code> is the same memory layout as an array of doubles in C, both making interop with C easy (indeed, in some sense "Julia is a layer on top of C") and it leads to high performance (the same is true for NumPy arrays).</p>

<p>Note here that I showed off Julia's unicode tab completion. Julia allows for unicode characters, and these can be used by tab completing Latex-like statements. Also, multiplication by a number is allowed without the * if followed by a variable. For example, the following is allowed Julia code:</p>

<h2 id="Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">Type-stability and Code Introspection<a href="#Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">¶</a></h2><p>Type stability is the idea that there is only 1 possible type which can be outputtted from a method. For example, the reasonable type to output from <code>*(::Float64,::Float64)</code> is a <code>Float64</code>. No matter what you give it, it will spit out a <code>Float64</code>. This right here is multiple-dispatch: the <code>*</code> operator calls a different method depending on the types that it sees. When it sees floats, it will spit out floats. Julia provides code introspection macros so that way you can see what your code actually compiles to. Thus Julia is not just a scripting language, it's a scripting language which lets you deal with assembly! Julia, like many languages, compiles to LLVM (LLVM is a type of portable assembly language).</p>

<p>This shows us that the <code>*</code> function has compiled down to exactly the same operation as what happens in C/Fortran, meaning it achieves the same performance (even though it's defined in Julia). Thus it is possible to not just get "close" to C, but actually get the same C code out. In what cases does this happen?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Julia is that, asking which cases this happens is not the right question. the right question is, in what cases does the code not compile to something as efficient as C/Fortran? The key here is type-stability. If a function is type-stable, then the compiler can know what the type will be at all points in the function and smartly optimize it to the same assembly as C/Fortran. If it is not type-stable, Julia has to add expensive "boxing" to ensure types are found/known before operations.</p>
<h4 id="This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">This is the key difference between Julia and other scripting languages<a href="#This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">¶</a></h4><p>The upside is that Julia's functions, when type stable, are essentially C/Fortran functions. Thus <code>^</code> (exponentiation) is fast. However, <code>^(::Int64,::Int64)</code> is type-stable, so what type should it output?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<div>
<p>Here we get an error. In order to guarantee to the compiler that <code>^</code> will give an Int64 back, it has to throw an error. If you do this in MATLAB, Python, or R, it will not throw an error. That is because those languages do not have their entire language built around type stability.</p>

<p>That's a very visual demonstration on why Julia achieves such higher performance than other scripting languages by how it uses type inference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Type stability is one crucial feature which separates Julia apart from other scripting languages.  In fact, the core idea of Julia is the following statement:</p>
<h4 id="Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">Multiple dispatch allows for a language to dispatch function calls onto type-stable functions.<a href="#Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">¶</a></h4><p>This is what Julia is all about, so let's take some time to dig into it.If you have type stability inside of a function (meaning, any function call within the function is also type-stable), then the compiler can know the types of the variables at every step. Therefore it can compile the function with the full amount of optimizations since at this point the code is essentially the same as C/Fortran code.  Multiple-dispatch works into this story because it means that <code>*</code> can be a type-stable function: it just means different things for different inputs. But if the compiler can know the types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> before calling <code>*</code>, then it knows which <code>*</code> method to use, and therefore it knows the output type of <code>c=a*b</code>. Thus it can propogate the type information all the way down, knowing all of the types along the way, allowing for full optimiziations. Multiple dispatch allows <code>*</code> to mean the "right thing" every time you use it, almost magically allowing this optimization.</p>
<p>There are a few things we learn from this. For one, in order to achieve this level of optimization, you must have type-stability. This is not featured in the standard libraries of most languages, and was choice that was made to make the experience a little easier for users. Secondly, multiple dispatch was required to be able to specialize the functions for types which allows for the scripting language syntax to be "more explicit than meets the eye". Lastly, a robust type system is required. In order to build the type-unstable exponentiation (which may be needed) we needed functionalities like convert. Thus the language must be designed to be type-stable with multiple dispatch and centered around a robust type system in order to achieve this raw performance while maintaining the syntax/ease-of-use of a scripting language. You can put a JIT on Python, but to really make it Julia, you would have to design it to be Julia.</p>

<h2 id="The-Julia-Benchmarks">The Julia Benchmarks<a href="#The-Julia-Benchmarks">¶</a></h2><p>The Julia benchmarks, featured on <a href="http://julialang.org/">the Julia website</a>, test components of the programming language for speed. <strong>This doesn't mean it's testing the fastest implemention</strong>. That is where a major misconception occurs. You'll have an R programmer look at the R code for the Fibonacci calculator and say "wow, that's terrible R code. You're not supposed to use recursion in R. Of course it's slow". However, the Fibonacci problem is designed to test recursion, not the fastest implementation to the the ith Fibonacci number. The other problems are the same way: testing basic components of the langauge to see how fast they are.</p>

    <p>
      I didn't want to be the guy write this post, but I am because Chris told
      me to so blame that fuckin guy. I'm a victim here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you're all using <code>const</code> in JavaScript too much and it
      does bug me just ever so little.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <code>const</code> doesn't do shit and we all know it</h3>

    <p>
      For starters, let's agree that <code>const</code> is fucking useless and
      we're inventing meaning...
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE = { right: "?" };
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.right = <em>"wrong"</em>;
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.<em>fucking</em> = <em>"deal with it"</em>;</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>const</code> does not imply any kind of immutability of the value
      itself, it only implies immutability of the <em>binding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which... Cool.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The linters can't save you now</h3>

    <p>
      Let's also eliminate the idea that we could somehow statically enforce
      that <em>const</em> values are immutable with a linter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like, sure, you could for the simple case:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const FOO = { prop: true };
FOO.prop = false; <em>// LINT ERR &gt;XD</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      But then like... side effects exist and shit will hurt you
    </p>

    <pre><code>export function mutatesProp(obj) {
  obj.prop = false;
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>import { mutatesProp } from './mutatesProp';
const FOO = { prop: true };
mutatesProp(FOO); <em>// no lint err :(</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      And yeah, type systems like Flow and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=have%20you%20tried%20typescript&amp;src=typd">HiHaveYouTriedTypeScriptYouShouldReallyTryTypeScriptIWriteTypeScriptAndImFuckingObnoxiousImGonnaStickMyHeadInAMicrowaveAndScreamTypeScript™</a> could do
      <em>something</em> with this, but like... they don't... sooooo
    </p>

    <h3>3. No it's not useful for compilers</h3>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, "Oh but it can still be used to optimize code or
      whatever"
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be right in thinking that compiler optimizations would make it
      interesting enough to use. But...
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be wrong in thinking that <code>const</code> is at all useful
      to optimizing compilers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's already really really easy to identify a binding and figure out if
      it's never reassigned. All of the relevant optimizations are already
      possible without <code>const</code> ever being a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, V8 and friends have been doing these optimizations without
      <code>const</code> for a really long time. Benedikt or Franziska or
      whoever can correct me if I'm wrong, but Babel definitely can already do
      this shit.
    </p>

    <h3>4. So what are we going to do?</h3>

    <p>
      First off, like... we don't <em>have</em> to <em>do</em> anything. There is no
      reason you would ever <em>have</em> to use <code>const</code>, and
      whereever we are using it, we could just as easily use <code>let</code>
      and our code wouldn't be impacted in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if you just want to stop here and never use <code>const</code>
      again and never question it further, you will save literally whole...
      minutes of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      But like... we <em>have</em> <code>const</code> so why don't we use it for
      <em>something</em> ...right? We could like use it to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. But what we've chosen to communicate is annoying as fuck</h3>

    <p>
      So, lots of people (okay maybe not you, you special little shit) are
      doing this... <em>thing</em> where they change every <code>let</code>
      variable which is never re-assigned to <code>const</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      They would see the above code and say "that <code>let</code> should be a
      <code>const</code> so that the reader knows at the declaration of
      <code>answer</code> that it never changes."
    </p>

    <p>
      And many of them will include linter tools for enforcing that rule on
      every variable declaration, even sometimes applying the "fix"
      automatically.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      "That's better."
    </p>

    <p>
      But... is it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you <em>really</em> mean to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> that
      we should never change the <code>answer</code> or do we just
      <em>happen</em> to never change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we came along later and decided we are okay changing the answer?
      But now it's a <code>const</code> and we aren't really sure if we're
      going to break someone's expectation for <code>answer</code> if we do
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of bindings that we <em>happen</em> to never change that
      we're totally fine if they do change. In fact, that's probably true for
      <em>most</em> bindings. It's not something your code will generally care
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by automatically applying this rule to every binding no matter what
      the author's actual intent was, we actually throw out our opportunity to
      <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> something.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So what should we actually use <code>const</code> for?</h3>

    <p>
      It's probably still a good idea to communicate that you really
      <em>don't</em> intend for something to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to communicate that, we need to only use it when
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <pre><code>const I_ACTUALLY_GIVE_A_SHIT_IF_THIS_CHANGES = 42;</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you want some good rules to follow, here's my best attempt:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Only use <code>const</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <pre><code>const <em>HERE</em> = "is okay";

function nested() {
  const <em>NOT_HERE</em> = "never seen a reason to";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I've never seen a binding created in a function that will
      actually be upset if it changes. I never use <code>const</code> inside
      nested scopes, and I don't intend to. Why? Because my mom raised me
      right (see my usage of semicolons), that's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Avoid using <code>let</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to use <code>let</code> at the top-level
      scope, that's a sign you have some sort of global singleton state which
      could cause you problems.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let globalState</em> = "hmmm...";

function fn() {
  <em>globalState =</em> "this seems fragile to test...";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And like... that's basically it...
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the love of all that is not shit, please don't try enforcing this
      with a linter. Let people communicate what they want to communicate.
      Ya'll drive me crazy with that shit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now get the fuck out of my house.
    </p>

Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS.

With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet.

Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168).

That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

October 20, 2020 | https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than
benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL
in a program, but they should not replace it.
</p>

<p>
Some background: For the past 30 months I’ve been working with code
that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most
of that has been with <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> (which I quite like) and <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>
(which I don’t). I’ve worked with existing code and data models, as
well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage
(“timelines”) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.
</p>

<p>
Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance
Mismatch. It’s hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, in his
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">well known essay</a>, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into
quagmires. In my experience, I’ve had to deal directly with a fair
number of them: <i>entity identity issues</i>, <i>dual-schema problem</i>, <i>data
retrieval mechanism concern</i>, and the <i>partial-object problem</i>. I want to
talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my
own.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge4f50a6">
<h2 id="orge4f50a6">Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys</h2>
<div id="text-orge4f50a6">
<p>
Perhaps the most subversive issue I’ve had with ORMs is “attribute
creep” or “wide tables”, that is, tables that just keep accruing
attributes. As much as I’d like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes
necessary (although things like <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html">Postgres’ hstore</a> can help). For
example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they
want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore,
you don’t have much insight into this data; you’re just schlepping it
around.
</p>

<p>
This in and of itself isn’t a terrible thing in a database. It becomes
a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to
show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the
query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.
</p>

<pre>query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq("x", value))
</pre>

<p>
This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire
hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using <code>SELECT
*</code>, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however,
encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as
tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding
the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to
seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a
Java object.)
</p>

<p>
Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign
keys. In the ORMs I’ve used, links between classes are represented in
the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully,
result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A
recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600
attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred
query methodology.)
</p>

<p>
Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in
order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My
contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL
since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d7e33d">
<h2 id="org2d7e33d">Data retrieval</h2>
<div id="text-org2d7e33d">
<p>
Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt
to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important
when efficiency is a concern.
</p>

<p>
From what I’ve seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that
is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure
out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of
the time, it’s more obfuscated than actual SQL.
</p>

<p>
And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of
work in the code that could be done in the database faster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function">Window
functions</a> are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with
ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be
transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your
application.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, I’ve elected to write queries using a templating
system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of
an application level description of the table with direct use of
SQL. It’s a lot less trouble than anything else I’ve used so far.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05d550b">
<h2 id="org05d550b">Dual schema dangers</h2>
<div id="text-org05d550b">
<p>
This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.  If you
try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive
complexity.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places:
the database and your application.  If you keep the definition
entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data
Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same
complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.  If you keep it
in the database, you will probably want a representation in the
application for convenience and to prevent too much “string typing”.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it
into the application.  It doesn’t solve the problem, but it makes it
more manageable.  I’ve found that reflection techniques to get the
data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the
redundancy of data definitons in two places.
</p>

<p>
But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the
model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the
database.  After all, databases are persistent whereas application
data is not.  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don’t help
manage data migration at all.  I work on the principle that the
database’s data definitions aren’t things you should manipulate in the
application.  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.  That is,
the queries are your API to the database.  So instead of thinking
about objects, I think about functions with return types.
</p>

<p>
Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but
convenience in making queries?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7033826">
<h2 id="org7033826">Identities</h2>
<div id="text-org7033826">
<p>
Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to
keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write
for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.
</p>

<p>
When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an
identifier. In your application, “identifier” takes on various
meanings, but usually it’s the memory location (a pointer). In the
database, it’s the state of the object itself. These two things don’t
really get along because you can really only use database identifiers
in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you’re working
with).
</p>

<p>
What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database
identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to
get the actual database identifier.
</p>

<p>
I can’t even call this a leaky abstraction because the work “leak”
implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddbdda4">
<h2 id="orgddbdda4">Transactions</h2>
<div id="text-orgddbdda4">
<p>
Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle
transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful
but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the
confusion they cause if overused.  This leads to a lot of boilerplate
code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where
transaction boundaries should occur.  It also makes you pass session
objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate
with the database.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to
their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping
is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical
scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know
about the “when” of a transaction when writing code that works with
databases and can make modularity tricky (“Here’s a useful function
that will only work in certain contexts”).
</p>

<p>
Where do I see myself going?
</p>

<p>
At this point, I’m starting to question the wisdom behind the outright
rejection of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures">stored procedures</a>.  It sounds <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil">heretical</a>, but it may work
for my use cases.  (And hey, with the advent of “devops”, the divide
between the developer and the database administrator is basically
non-existent.)
</p>

<p>
I’ve found myself thinking about the database as just another data
type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some
type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving
away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be
stored in a database (the raison d’être for ORMs) and instead thinking
of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I’ve found working
with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering
why I didn’t see it earlier.
</p>

<p>
(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all
applications should deal with a database.  All I am saying is that
this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren’t actually
that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing:
I won’t fall into the “ORMs make it easy” trap. They are an acceptable
way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries
and a bad way to store object state. If you’re using an RDBMS, bite
the bullet and learn SQL.

                <h3>Test Automation</h3>
                <p>In today’s delivery methods like Agile and Continuous Delivery, every software dependent business is
                    focused to release quality software products often and faster than ever before.</p>
                <p>There are many factors that influence the delivery of software faster at reduced cost. According to
                    the WQR, slower time to market, increased QA costs and an over dependence on manual testing are a
                    major bottleneck in ensuring the release
                    of better products, faster.</p>
                <p>Its time every company shifted from Manual testing to Test Automation to address these challenges.
                </p>
                <p>The objective of software test automation is to simplify the software testing process as easy as
                    possible with minimum effort. Test Automation has a positive impact on the cost, quality and time to
                    market the software.</p><br>
            </div>
        </div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Aren’t manual tests really enough?</h3>
                <p>Not considering today’s software delivery needs.</p>
                <p>Enhancements or changes made to an application must be tested and retested to check that it does not
                    break the existing code. Test Automation is most effective in performing such regression tests on
                    multiple device/OS/browser combinations
                    with the help of Automated testing tools.</p>
                <p>This would be a tedious task, if done manually. Functional Testers need to go through every feature
                    of the application, look for possible input combinations, compare and document each outcome with the
                    expected one.</p>
                <p>In such short cycles it is difficult to test every feature of the application, manually. Manual
                    Testing would require a lot of resources, time and cost for this.</p>
                <p>Without Test Automation one has to compromise on the test coverage, which is not recommended.</p>
                <p>However, Manual Testing cannot be overlooked as it involves creative and logical analysis of the
                    application under test.</p>
                <p>There is a need of an integrated manual testing and test automation environment to improve the
                    collaboration between the teams and increase productivity. </p><br>

                    <p>As the tests are automated you can choose to execute some or all of the tests to cover the
                        affected areas. You don't need to compromise on the coverage due to a lack of time towards the
                        end of the cycle.</p>

                <h3>Getting started with Test Automation</h3>
                <p>Test Automation is not just about programming the test actions. It is an ecosystem of various
                    components and resources like the test automation team, test automation tools, test environments,
                    proper management of test data, integrations
                    that help deliver quality software faster.</p>
                <h4><strong> Test Automation demands </strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><i></i>

                        <p> Expertise in multiple tools and technologies for different application types</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Need for training on the tools being used </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Availability of realistic Test Environments to try and execute tests </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Integrations with multiple tools like Test Management tool, Test Data Management tool, CI/CD
                            tools, Defect tracking and reporting tools, Collaboration tools etc. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It takes significant time and effort to set the Test Automation ecosystem. Each application type
                    would require different sets of tools and one tool that suffices every application type hardly
                    exist. Though Test Automation is the right
                    choice in identifying and fixing bugs at an early stage, there are several tailbacks associated with
                    it.</p>
                <p>This initial demand of cost, resources, time and effort, makes it difficult for smaller teams to get
                    started with Test Automation.

        <p>When writing JavaScript applications, you describe its dependencies using a <code>package.json</code> file. This file contains all of your applications direct dependencies and their versions.</p>

<p>If you’re building a RESTful API using Express, for, example, your <code>package.json</code> file will probably list <code>express</code> as a dependency.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whenever you ask others to clone and run your application, they need to install its dependencies using <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause them to download the version <code>4.0.0</code> of Express.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock1.png" alt="An image showing that your application points to the Express pacakge, meaning it depends on it."></p>
<center><i>Your application's direct dependency on Express.</i></center>

<p>When installing Express, a package upon which your application depends, you will also download all of the packages upon which Express itself depends. Among the packages upon which Express depends, you can find, for example, <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send"><code>send</code></a>, a package which provides a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918845/what-exactly-does-serving-static-files-mean">static file server</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock2.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which in turn points to the send package."></p>
<center><i>Express depends on `send`, which causes it to be downloaded when installing your application's dependencies.</i></center>

<p>Additionally, when installing Express and, consequently, <code>send</code>, you will have to install the dependencies of <code>send</code>. Because <code>send</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types"><code>mime-types</code></a>, , a utility package to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mime-types</a>, NPM will install also install <code>mime-types</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock3.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which points to the send package, which then points to the mime-types package."></p>
<center><i>The `send` package depends upon `mime-types`.</i></center>

<p>Finally, when installing <code>mime-types</code>, NPM will notice that <code>mime-types</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db"><code>mime-db</code></a>, and will install <code>mime-db</code> too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock4.png" alt="The dependency chain pointing from your application to express, then to send, then to mime-types, and, finally, pointing to mime-db."></p>
<center><i>NPM downloads the `mime-db` package when installing your application's dependencies because it's a dependency of other dependencies.</i></center>

<p>The process of recursively downloads all of your packages’ dependencies and the dependencies of those dependencies is what causes your <code>node_modules</code> folder to get heavy so quickly.</p>

<p>Even though you only listed <code>express</code> as a dependency, if you check your <code>node_modules</code> folder — the folder in which NPM stores dependencies — you will see that there are many more packages there.</p>

<p>These packages are not only Express’ dependencies, but also the dependencies of <em>all</em> dependencies.</p>

<p>This dependency download process would be beautiful if it weren’t for the fact that <strong><code>npm install</code> doesn’t necessarily install the same dependencies given the same <code>package.json</code> file</strong>.</p>

<p>Running <code>npm install</code> in the afternoon can cause you to get different dependencies when compared to the <code>npm install</code> your colleague ran in the morning, even though none of you changed the version of Express upon which the application depends, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Having different dependencies is a problem because it can cause the application to present inconsistent behaviour across different environments, which is yet another cause for headaches when you’re trying to build reliable software</strong>.</p>





<p>When listing dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file, you can prefix their versions with a <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>. Each of these symbols will tell NPM that it doesn’t necessarily need to download the exact version you specified. Instead, it will try to download a version which is “compatible” or “equivalent” to the one in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, that you prepended <code>^</code> to Express’ version number in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"^4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In that case, if Express’ maintainers release a fix and bump their version number to <code>4.0.1</code>, running <code>npm install</code> would install the <code>4.0.1</code> version, not the <code>4.0.0</code> as you’ve written in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Express’ maintainers release a new feature and bump their version number to <code>4.1.0</code>, the <code>npm install</code> command will download <code>4.1.0</code>, which <em>should</em> be compatible with the <code>4.0.0</code> version you listed in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time, using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> should <em>not</em> cause problems, because, according to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, bumping <code>minor</code> — the middle version number — or <code>patch</code> — the rightmost version number — means that there are no breaking changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock5.png" alt="In a 4.1.2 version, 4 is the major version number, which indicates breaking changes, 1 is the minor version number, which indicates new features, and 2 is the patch version number, which indicates fixes."></p>
<center><i>Bumping the leftmost version number indicates there have been breaking changes. The middle version number indicates a release contains new features. The rightmost number indicates fixes.</i></center>

<p>However, given enough time, all humans make mistakes. They may, for example, bump the <code>minor</code> or <code>patch</code> when there’s a breaking change, causing builds to break like I once did when I incorrectly released breaking changes to <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/862">bumped the wrong version number</a>, causing millions of builds to break around the world.</p>

<p>So does this mean that <em>not</em> using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> causes <code>npm install</code> to <em>always</em> download the same dependency tree? No, it doesn’t 🙃</p>

<p><strong>Even though you may not add <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> in front of your dependencies’ versions, your dependencies may list <em>their</em> dependencies using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>, which can cause <code>npm install</code> to download different versions depending on the time you’ve run it.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve specified Express’ <code>4.0.0</code> version as a dependency, but Express itself listed <code>send</code> as a dependency using <code>^1.0.0</code>, for example, you could end-up downloading the version <code>1.0.1</code> of <code>send</code> in the morning, and version <code>1.0.2</code> in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the <code>send</code> package’s maintainers release breaking changes and incorrectly tag them as <code>1.0.2</code>, your application could break even though you locked <em>your application’s</em> dependencies by avoiding <code>^</code> and <code>~</code>.</p>





<p>The <code>package-lock.json</code> file lists your application’s dependencies and the dependencies of all its dependencies. In other words, it describes which version of every single package you have installed. That’s why it’s so much longer than <code>package.json</code>.
Whenever you use <code>package-lock.json</code> to install dependencies, you will get the exact same packages, it doesn’t matter whether you’re installing them now or in a thousand years when we’ll hopefully not be using keyboards anymore.</p>

<p>To install dependencies based on your <code>package-lock.json</code> file, you should use <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>By using <code>npm ci</code> you will be able to avoid problems which happen when an application works in your machine, but doesn’t work in someone else’s because they ended up downloading different dependencies due to using <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>That’s why, whenever running your builds in a <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day">continuous integration server</a>, you should install dependencies using <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause the CI server’s build to run just like it had run in your machine.</p>

<p><strong>The reason <code>package-lock.json</code> may change automatically when you run <code>npm install</code> is because NPM is updating the <code>package-lock.json</code> file to accurately reflect all the dependencies it has downloaded since it may have gotten more up-to-date versions of some of them.</strong> Once NPM updates the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, others can get those exact same versions by using <code>npm ci</code> if they want.</p>





<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/">evil human-beings will obtain control of other people’s NPM credentials and release new versions of packages by bumping the package’s <code>patch</code> version number, causing millions of dependants to download the malicious piece of code</a>.</p>

<p>It’s enough for a single package in your entire dependency tree to be compromised for you to end-up downloading the malicious code. Sometimes, the compromised package will not even be a direct dependency of your application or even a dependency of one of your application’s dependencies. It may be, for example, a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.</p>

<p>Because <code>npm ci</code> will cause you to download the exact same packages every time, it will be less likely for you to install malicious code given you have taken the necessary security precautions.</p>





<p><em>Most of the time</em>, package maintainers will bump the correct version numbers when releasing features or fixes, and there is no harm in having these features and fixes in. If anything, they may make your application faster or solve a bug you have.</p>

<p>In other words, having <code>npm install</code> makes it easier to get the “best” versions of packages: the ones with more features and fixes.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm ci</code> exist for slightly different purposes. While the former installs the latest possible versions of your dependencies, the latter installs the exact same versions you had when you last used <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>An additional advantage of using <code>npm ci</code> is its quicker execution. The <code>npm ci</code> command runs faster than <code>npm install</code> because it doesn’t need to check what’s the latest compatible version of a package. Instead, it knows exactly which version to fetch thanks to the exhaustive dependency list in <code>package-lock.json</code>. <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable">In some cases, dependency installations can happen twice as fast</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>install</code> doesn’t by default use <code>package-lock.json</code>, is somewhat controversial, though. Some people would advocate that updating dependencies by default is significantly dangerous and that one should be very explicit when doing it.</p>





<p>Personally, I like to use <code>npm install</code> whenever I’m installing dependencies myself, and <code>npm ci</code> in all my scripts.</p>

<p>I use <code>npm install</code> when installing dependencies myself because, in that case, I can vet which versions I get and make sure that I’ll be using the latest versions of packages, which can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don’t want any of my scripts to update dependencies because machines running automated …</p></article></div>

You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them in assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take. How should you break the tie? </p><p>I’d say fun. There are so many schleps in a startup that programming should be as fun as possible. Once. I narrowed down. I’d choose the language I’m most excited about.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Sean Grove, Daniel Woelfel, Joe Averbukh, Alex Reichert for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>About 6 years ago, when I was in my first few months at Pebble as a firmware engineer, I decided to take an entire workday to read through the majority of the GDB manual. It was by far one of my best decisions as an early professional engineer. After that day, I felt like I was 10x faster at debugging the Pebble firmware and our suite of unit tests. I even had a new <code>.gdbinit</code> script with a few macros and configuration flags to boot, which I continue to amend to this day.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve learned from many firmware developers and am here writing this post to share what I’ve learned along the way. If you have any comments or suggestions about this post, I would love to hear from you in <a href="https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/">Interrupt’s Slack channel</a>.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this reference-style post, we discuss some of the more advanced and powerful commands of the GNU debugger, GDB, as well as cover some of the best practices and hacks I’ve found over the years that help make GDB more pleasant to use.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>Although there might be debuggers and interfaces out there that provide better experiences than using GDB directly, many of them are built on top of GDB and provide raw access to the GDB shell, where you can build and use automation through the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">Python scripting API</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of most of the sections, there are links to either subpages with the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">GDB manual</a> or to the original content to learn more about the topic discussed.</p>

<h2 id="essentials">Essentials</h2>

<p>First, we need to cover the items which I feel are most important for any developer or team to work efficiently within GDB.</p>



<p>There’s no better place to start learning GDB than to first learn how to search the help menus. Surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, GDB has over 1500+ commands!</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Count number of GDB commands in the master help list
$ gdb --batch -ex 'help all' | grep '\-\-' | wc
    1512   16248  117306
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in mind, the most useful command within GDB is <code>apropos</code>, which searches all the “help” menus of each command. To use it, simply type <code>apropos &lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) apropos symbol
add-symbol-file -- Load symbols from FILE, assuming FILE has been dynamically loaded.
add-symbol-file-from-memory -- Load the symbols out of memory from a dynamically loaded object file.
attach -- Attach to a process or file outside of GDB.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the individual help menu of any command in GDB, just type <code>help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and GDB will output everything it knows about the command or subcommand.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help apropos
Search for commands matching a REGEXP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If help is used on a collection of commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help info
Generic command for showing things about the program being debugged.

List of info subcommands:

info address -- Describe where symbol SYM is stored.
info all-registers -- List of all registers and their contents, for selected stack frame.
info args -- All argument variables of current stack frame or those matching REGEXPs.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html#index-apropos">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="gdb-history">GDB History</h3>

<p>Next, we need to ensure that command history is enabled.</p>

<p>By default GDB does not save any history of the commands that were run during each session. This is especially annoying because GDB supports <code>CTRL+R</code> for history search just like your shell!</p>

<p>To fix this, we can place the following in our <code>.gdbinit</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set history save on
set history size 10000
set history filename ~/.gdb_history
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in place, GDB will now keep the last 10,000 commands in a file ~/.gdb_history.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Command-History.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="sharing-gdbinit-files">Sharing <code>.gdbinit</code> Files</h3>

<p>I’m a huge believer in developer productivity, and I try my best to share my best-practices with co-workers and the greater community. In the past, I’ve made it a point to have per-project GDB configuration files that are automatically loaded for everyone by default.</p>

<p>This could be in a bash script <code>debug.sh</code> which developers use instead of typing <code>gdb</code> and all the arguments by hand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

gdb build/symbols.elf <span>\</span>
    <span>-ix</span><span>=</span>./gdb/project.gdbinit <span>\</span>
    <span>--ex</span><span>=</span><span>'source ./gdb/extra_gdb.py'</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Better yet, you can build a <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects">Project CLI using Invoke</a> which wraps the GDB invocation into an <code>invoke debug</code> command.</p>

<p>This ensures that everyone working on the project has the latest set of configuration flags and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">GDB Python scripts</a> to accelerate their debugging.</p>

<h2 id="source-files">Source Files</h2>

<p>With the essentials out of the way, let’s dive into learning GDB! The first thing to talk about is how best to view and navigate the source code while debugging.</p>

<h3 id="directory-search-paths">Directory Search Paths</h3>

<p>Many times, the CI system builds with absolute paths instead of paths relative to the project root, which causes GDB not to be able to find the source files.</p>

<p>It will produce an error like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) f 1
#2  cli_state_collect (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:1952
1952	../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:
    No such file or directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are proactive and want to fix this permanently in the build step, you can follow the steps in Interrupt’s post about <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/reproducible-firmware-builds">Reproducible Firmware Builds</a> to make the paths relative.</p>

<p>If you want to patch it up now in GDB, you can use a combination of the <code>set substitute-path</code> and <code>directory</code> commands in GDB, depending on how the paths are built.</p>

<p>To fix the above issue, all I needed to do was to add a local directory. After adding it, GDB can find the source code of the line in the frame.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) directory sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk/
Source directories searched: /[...]/sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk:$cdir:$cwd
(gdb) f 1
#1  0x000292a2 in cli_execute (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:2554
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="source-context-with-list">Source Context with <code>list</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes, you just want to quickly add a few lines above and below the current line. To quickly view ten lines of source-code context within GDB, you can use the <code>list</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) list
2549	                &amp;p_static_entry,
2550	                &amp;static_entry);
2551
2552	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd = p_static_entry;
2553
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
2555	                                               argc - cmd_handler_lvl,
2556	                                               &amp;argv[cmd_handler_lvl]);
2557	    }
2558	    else if (handler_cmd_lvl_0 != NULL)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to set a larger or smaller default number of lines shown with this command, you can change the setting:</p>



<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/List.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="viewing-assembly-with-disassemble">Viewing Assembly With <code>disassemble</code></h3>

<p>It’s often useful to dive into the assembly of a specific function. GDB has this capability built-in and can even interleave the source code with the assembly (by using the <code>/s</code> option).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /s nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on
Dump of assembler code for function nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on:
nrf_cli.c:
3511	{
3512	    if (nrf_cli_build_in_cmd_common_executed(p_cli, (argc != 1), NULL, 0))
   0x0002969c &lt;+0&gt;:	ldr	r3, [r0, #8]
   0x0002969e &lt;+2&gt;:	ldr.w	r2, [r3, #316]	; 0x13c

nrf_cli.h:
604	    return p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;internal.flag.show_help;
   0x000296a2 &lt;+6&gt;:	lsls	r2, r2, #30
   0x000296a4 &lt;+8&gt;:	bmi.n	0x296b8 &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+28&gt;

nrf_cli.c:
3391	    if (arg_cnt_nok)
   0x000296a6 &lt;+10&gt;:	cmp	r1, #1
   0x000296a8 &lt;+12&gt;:	bne.n	0x296bc &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+32&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want something more powerful than <code>disassemble</code>, you can use <code>objdump</code> itself. Interrupt’s <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-binutils#objdump">post on GNU Binutils</a> is a great reference for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Machine-Code.html">Reference</a></p>

<h2 id="gdb-visual-interfaces">GDB Visual Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are many visual interfaces that are built into or on top of GDB. Let’s go through a few of the most popular ones.</p>

<h3 id="gdb-tui">GDB TUI</h3>

<p>GDB has a built-in graphical interface for viewing source code, registers, assembly, and other various items, and it’s quite simple to use!</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/advanced-gdb/gdb-tui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can start the TUI interface by running:</p>



<p>This should give you the source code viewer. You are now able to type <code>next</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>continue</code>, etc. and the TUI interface will update and follow along.</p>

<p>If you want to view the assembly as well, you can run:</p>



<p>To show the registers at the top of the window, you can type:</p>



<h3 id="alternate-gdb-interfaces">Alternate GDB Interfaces</h3>

<p>Although TUI is nice, I don’t know many people who use it and see it more as a gimmick. It’s great for quick observations and exploration, but I would suggest spending the 15-30 minutes to get something set up that is more powerful and permanent.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into using <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</a> or <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-GDB">Conque-GDB</a> if you’d like to stick with using GDB itself.</p>

<p>For a full list of GUI enhancements to GDB, you can check out the list of plugins from my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdbundle-plugin-manager#neat-gdb-script-repositories">previous post on GDBundle</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gdbgui">gdbgui</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gdbgui.com/">gdbgui</a> is a browser-based frontend to GDB, built by Chad Smith, who also happens to be the author of another one of my favorite tools, <a href="https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx">pipx</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs01/gdbgui/master/screenshots/gdbgui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>gdbgui is great tool if you don’t want to use a vendor-provided debugger but still want to have a visual way to interface with GDB.</p>

<h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>

<p>VSCode has pretty good support for GDB baked in. If you are just using GDB to debug C/C++ code locally on your machine, you should be able to follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-debug">official instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to do remote debugging on devices connected with OpenOCD, PyOCD, or JLink, you’ll want to look into the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide">Platform.io</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug">Cortex-Debug</a> extensions.</p>

<h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>

<p>The next topic to cover is interacting with registers through GDB.</p>

<h3 id="printing-registers">Printing Registers</h3>

<p>You can print the register values within GDB using <code>info registers</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) info registers
r0             0x2                 2
r1             0x7530              30000
r2             0x10000194          268435860

This overhaul replaced a pure JS parser (generated by <a href="https://github.com/zaach/jison">jison</a>) with one that delegated parsing to <a href="https://github.com/rakaly/jomini">an implementation written in Rust</a> compiled to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly (Wasm)</a>. I want to share my journey, as overall it’s been positive and I expect that other JS libraries could benefit from this approach.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The parser in question turns a proprietary format that is akin to JSON and looks like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">tag=AAA
name="Jåhkåmåhkke"
core=BBB
buildings={ 1 2 }
core=CCC
</code></pre></div><p>and returns a plain javascript object</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">{
  tag: "AAA",
  name: "Jåhkåmåhkke",
  core: ["BBB", "CCC"],
  buildings: [1, 2]
}
</code></pre></div><p>So what were the pain points of the original JS implementation?</p>
<h2 id="original-motivation">Original Motivation</h2>
<p>Soon after releasing the JS library I stopped actively developing it. The files that I want to parse are millions of lines long which could result in tens of millions of JS values (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and dates). Parsing and allocating this many objects was taxing enough that back in 2015 I found no way to practically run it – the memory pressure caused nodejs to run out of heap space and when the code didn’t crash, the time required to parse said files would easily reach 30-60 seconds.</p>
<p>In 2020, I wrote this parser in Rust. The results have been fantastic: zero-copy parsing at 1 GB/s.</p>
<p>But speed wasn’t the only contributing factor. In fact, I firmly believe that someone could design a performant (but maybe not as performant) of an API around this format in pure JS. The other big motivating factor is accuracy and consistency. In no way do I own or control this proprietary format, so new syntax is stumbled upon all the time. Most recently data like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">levels = { 10 0=1 0=2 }
color = hex { eeeeee }
color = rgb { 0 100 150 }
</code></pre></div><p>So when I doubled down to cover all known syntax in Rust, I couldn’t imagine duplicating that effort for other languages and then keeping the parsing logic in sync. The Rust parser has been battle proven in multiple projects and I don’t want to start from scratch for a new language. To me, it seems preferable to have one implementation and bind others to it. Considering I’ve written this parser in C#, F#, JS, and most recently Rust – anything that cuts down on maintenance work is desirable.</p>
<p>My mind shifted to the JS implementation. Rust can compile to Wasm and both nodejs and browsers can execute Wasm, so rewriting the JS parser to delegate to Wasm seemed like the first step in determining how feasible it is to have all logic contained in Rust.</p>
<p>I should note that .NET languages can utilize Wasmtime to run Wasm, but this is not as mature. I wanted to start prototyping Wasm on the most mature platforms. Part of this process was to test if Wasm is too immature for a given ecosystem. In a fledgling Wasm ecosystem one could still be able to dip down to interoperating with native libraries (though native libraries have their own tradeoffs).</p>
<h2 id="rust-wasm-and-the-js-wrapper">Rust Wasm and the JS Wrapper</h2>
<p>This won’t be a tutorial on Rust and tools (<a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/">wasm-bindgen</a> and <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/">wasm-pack</a>). I suggest reading their respective books and tutorials.</p>
<p>My view is that one should always write a JS wrapper for the Wasm that exposes the Rust code as idiomatically as possible instead of making the Wasm a separate NPM package. To me, an idiomatic design means the loading and compiling of Wasm is entirely user driven. For instance, I have users create instances through a static <code>initialize</code> function that transparently handles the wasm.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>import</span> <span>init</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>the_wasm</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js_bg.wasm"</span>;

<span>let</span> <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Jomini</span> {
  <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span>() {}

  <span>/* snip member functions that use wasm functions */</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>initialize</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> () <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span><span>initialized</span>) {
      <span>// @ts-ignore
</span><span></span>      <span>await</span> <span>init</span>(<span>the_wasm</span>());
      <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Jomini</span>();
  };
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that the wasm is cached on subsequent <code>initialize</code> invocations. Small Wasm bundles can still incur a non-negligible performance tax (50 kb compiles in 20ms), so cache them.</p>
<p>And in case you are curious about performance, it’s great! The Wasm implementation can parse a 1.3 million line file in 160ms. Considering parsing it in Rust takes 70ms, I think this is a great outcome. What might come as a bit of a performance shock is that deserializing the parsed data to a JS object takes over 6 seconds! I find this incredible – object creation can be more expensive than parsing. Expensive object creation isn’t restricted to JS either, <a href="https://github.com/TkTech/pysimdjson#-benchmarks">python is also afflicted</a>. We can fix this with a bit of ingenuity.</p>
<h2 id="wasm-lifetimes">Wasm Lifetimes</h2>
<p>The parser is zero-copy, but as shown it can be too expensive to serialize the parsed data to a JS object. The solution is to do less work: have the user specify the data they are interested in ahead of time using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON pointer</a> syntax. The below example extracts the player and then extracts the <code>prestige</code> field from the player’s country.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> } <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(
  <span>buffer</span>,
  { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> },
  (<span>query</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>"/player"</span>);
    <span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>`/countries/</span><span>${</span><span>player</span><span>}</span><span>/prestige`</span>);
    <span>return</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> };
  }
);
</code></pre></div><p>The alternative would be doing the same operations but on the decoded object.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> <span>save</span> <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(<span>buffer</span>, { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> });
<span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>player</span>;
<span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>countries</span>[<span>player</span>].<span>prestige</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Querying for just the interesting bits completes 40x faster (6.3s vs 0.16s) and uses about half the memory.</p>
<p>How this query API is accomplished with a zero-copy parser (a struct that has a lifetime to the underlying data) is a bit tricky, as <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/423">wasm-bindgen doesn’t let one expose a struct with a lifetime</a>. The solution looks as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Query</span> {
    _backing_data: Vec<span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    tape: <span>TextTape</span><span>&lt;</span>'static<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p>This struct works as desired through a two pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We transmute away the lifetime of <code>tape</code> to static so that we can store it in a wasm-bindgen compatible struct. This is the only <code>unsafe</code> operation – and it has to be unsafe as we’re exposing this to JS and Rust can’t borrow check JS usage.</li>
<li>It’s important to own the data that was parsed so that our referenced data isn’t reclaimed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also why the API is exposed in a callback, so that the user extracts the data they are interested in and at the end of the callback, <code>Query</code> is freed (a method generated by wasm-bindgen on exposed structs) for the user so they don’t have to worry about manual memory management. This goes back to ensuring that users have an idiomatic API at their disposal.</p>
<h2 id="bundling">Bundling</h2>
<p>This will be the most opinionated section here. I prefer projects with a small number of dev dependencies and a minimal amount of configuration.</p>
<p>Here’s the build step from <code>package.json</code>: we manually call wasm-pack and remove any previous invocations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"build"</span>: <span>"wasm-pack build -t web --out-dir ../src/pkg crate &amp;&amp; rm -rf dist/ &amp;&amp; rollup -c"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And the rollup config is also simplistic</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>import</span> { <span>wasm</span> } <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-wasm"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>typescript</span> <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-typescript"</span>;

<span>const</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>=</span> (<span>fmt</span>) =&gt; ({
  <span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/index.ts"</span>,
  <span>output</span><span>:</span> {
    <span>dir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>,
    <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>fmt</span>,
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"jomini"</span>,
  },
  <span>plugins</span><span>:</span> [
    <span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> }),
    <span>typescript</span>({ <span>outDir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> }),
  ],
});

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> [<span>rolls</span>(<span>"cjs"</span>), <span>rolls</span>(<span>"es"</span>)];
</code></pre></div><p>Rollup is used as it’s the best tool to generate both CommonJS and ES modules. CommonJS for the nodejs folks and ES modules for those using bundlers that can take advantage of tree shaking to remove unused code. The tree shaking is partially limited by the support code that the Wasm bundle executes on load (ie: setting up heap), but this shouldn’t be too restrictive especially if the main API of a library uses Wasm. Make sure that your <code>package.json</code> contains the appropriate references to the modules and types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"main"</span>: <span>"./dist/cjs/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"module"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"types"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/lib/index.d.ts"</span>,
  <span>"files"</span>: [<span>"dist"</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>For those curious, I’ve eschewed the <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust"><code>@wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust</code></a> package as sometimes introducing a middleman doesn’t significantly cut down on code and it introduces another layer to debug when things go wrong.</p>
<p>It’s easy to miss in the config snippet, but the below function inlines our Wasm as a base64 encoded string if our Wasm is less than 100kb (an arbitrarily chosen number that is larger than our bundle)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> })
</code></pre></div><p>The Wasm itself is still compiled asynchronously. If we omitted <code>maxFileSize</code>, then the Wasm file would be generated as a complementary file. An additional file that has to be fetched is not desirable, as it would be surprising behavior for clients who may not be aware of all the implications from direct or transitive dependencies (ie: they may need a build system that understands Wasm if they are deploying to the web). By inlining as base64 we make the Wasm an implementation detail (for node 12+ and the vast majority of browser users). Yes, base64 does cause the Wasm bundle to grow ~33% but this is offset by two factors: compression, so the cost of transferring across the network is less than 33%, and the Wasm bundles generated by Rust tend to be small. As long as one stays cognizant of file sizes this shouldn’t be an issue. For me, the generated Wasm bundle is 54 KB and <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=jomini@0.3.3">bundlephobia lists the total bundle size (JS + inlined base64 Wasm) as 33.4 KB after minification and compression</a>, which is smaller than <code>react-dom</code> (35.6 KB). In my opinion this price is easily justified. If the Wasm bundle is significantly larger, I suspect the likelihood of clients being aware of their dependency implications increases, so one can opt to supply the Wasm bundle as a separate file.</p>

The Vive XR Suite offers the ultimate VR enterprise software solution, specifically designed to help businesses solve today’s most pressing problems in a secure and innovative way By putting the resources of HTC behind these apps, we can ensure business customers around the world receive the system scalability and professional support they demand.”</em></p><p>The apps were developed separately but they can all be accessed through a single login on most PC VR headsets, but HTC have partnered with companies like Pico, HP, and NReal to preload the suite on their headsets.</p><p>The full “Vive XR Suite” will cost companies $30 per seat for one month or $250 per seat for a full year.</p>
