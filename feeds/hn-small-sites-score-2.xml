<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Content sites are great, low barrier to entry businesses that (when done right) can generate a sustainable source of cash. </p><p>Not only that, but they’re also fun. Using the method I’m going to outline below, you can pick a topic that really interests you — learn more about it — and make money in the process.</p><p>I started two of my own content sites a few years ago. They were my first foray into internet businesses and affiliate marketing. When I started the first one (about running — Let’s Go Run), I had no idea what I was doing, and no money to do it. </p><p>I scrounged around the internet finding resources about SEO, keyword planning and blogging. I went through about three SemRush trial’s (sorry SemRush!) with different emails trying to come up with a keyword plan, and figure out why the hell my blog posts weren’t coming up on Google! Then, after about 4 months of working on it and putting out content religiously, I started ranking for one of my main keywords. </p><p>I made it to the front page of Google! I’ll never forget the excitement.</p><p>That got me hooked. I spent the next few years growing out that site, and creating another one with my mom (who loves golf). </p><p>I got them to the small-medium level (each had traffic of about 10k monthly visits) and then sold them online. I needed the cash to start what I thought was a ‘real’ business. </p><p>The thing is, I sold them way before I had monetized each of them properly. I just didn’t know what I was doing! And the buyer knew it. All the income was from affiliate earnings, and they were running off the same account (so I don’t have specific figures for each website), earning around about $80 to $100 mark per month combined.</p><p>Knowing what I do now about niche content sites, and their ability to generate a sustainable cash flow, I would have never sold those sites. </p><p>This is my approach to building content sites that are monetized effectively, and how you can too.</p><h2>Background</h2><h3>What Are They?</h3><p>A niche content site is just a website where people wanting to know about something in a certain niche go to find that out.</p><p>If you take any subreddit, and create content specifically tailored to that audience, it would be a niche content site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52457e66346b8d05835d_0*gL3fHRm-e86x0tgu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Swim University is the perfect example of a niche site: Everything you need to know about keeping a pool clean.</p><h3>How Do They Work?</h3><p>The fundamentals of it are as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li>Pick a specific niche.</li><li>Create content around that niche, and post it on the website.</li><li>Drive readers to that website.</li><li>Build an audience of readers.</li><li>Monetize that audience.</li></ol><h3>A Modified Approach</h3><p>The approach I’m going to give you here uses the framework above, but modifies the Monetization step slightly.</p><p>The goal is simple: <strong>Get to revenue as fast as possible.</strong></p><p>We’ll go into monetization further below, but the gist of it is this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Traditional niche site model requires a ton of traffic to make decent money (especially today).</li><li>My model requires a few thousand views a month with high intent and in a specific niche.</li></ul><h3>Examples</h3><p><strong>SwimUniversity.com</strong> (above) — Pool care</p><p><strong>GearLab.com</strong> — Outdoor gear reviews</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524647ea4173bd1d6c06_0*d8YHEXfmp62TptgH.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>ApartmentTherapy.com — </strong>Kit out and care for your trendy apartment</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524669ed957a4dbc995f_0*9KPXKzA3bD2Qt04E.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Fatherly.com</strong> — A site for dad’s</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a5245e566339d3104c7a4_0*kZ2EoL3V_m9I3aZ7.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Before you continue, understand your motivation for wanting to do this.</p><p>Here’s mine: <strong>Cash</strong>. Niche sites are great cash generators if you can get them right. As long as you have a steady flow of traffic, they can bring in a (mostly) reliable income every single month.</p><p>For me, that means not having to worry about rent as an expense.</p><p>For you, it might mean an additional income to fund your startup.</p><p>Get clear on your motivation to do this so that when things aren’t going so well, you know whether to knuckle down and commit, or bail out because it’s taking too much time and energy to achieve what you want.</p><p>These aren’t sexy businesses, but they work if you do ’em right.</p><h2>🚵 Pick A Niche</h2><p><strong>And validate it, too.</strong></p><p>This is my unconventional advice: <strong>Start with your interests</strong>.</p><p>The thesis behind that is: If you’re not interested in it, you’re not going to want to create content about it.</p><p>One thing I do know is that for this to be successful you have to commit to creating enough content.</p><p>There are a few things you need to consider when picking a niche, though.</p><h3><strong>Audience size</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>You need a big enough audience to make this viable. <em>Golf</em> = too broad and too competitive. <em>Left-Handed Blind Golfers</em> = too niche. You get the point.</li><li>I would define niche as SwimUniversity.com (above).</li><li>I would define micro-niche as SwimUniversity.com but for glass fibre pools only.</li><li>As a guide — though this is very dependent on your audience and monetization method — your monthly search volume shouldn’t be lower than 30k visits (or 1k visitors a day).</li></ul><h3><strong>Can you monetize it?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Does this audience typically spend money on this interest? Either directly or indirectly. If yes, then the answer will almost always be continue.</li></ul><p>or…</p><ul role="list"><li>Can you generate a ton of search traffic (100k monthly +), which you’d be able to monetize through Display Ads? This would require large search volume for your search keywords, as well as low domain authority for the competing sites. This is generally only available in completely unexplored niches (of which there are very few around).</li></ul><h3><strong>How does that audience consume most of their content?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>And can you create that content. If your niche consumes mainly blog posts, great. Low barrier. If they mostly consume well produced video content, and you have no experience doing that = bit higher barrier.</li></ul><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Write down all your interests, and then some. Aim for 50 ideas.</li><li>Rank them in order of how ‘niche’ they are. Ie: How many other people are there who share this interest in the world.</li><li>Then rank them in order of your interest in each of them.</li><li>Choose the top 5 combined ranking.</li><li>Sign up for a keyword volume research tool (Most of them offer free trials). I use <a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/#a5dca93d6feebf8609c185b05" target="_blank">Mangools</a>. It’s a lot cheaper (and a bit less powerful) than <a href="https://www.semrush.com/lp/all-in-one-marketing-toolkit/en/?ref=3487429516&amp;refer_source=15-business-ideas-blog-post&amp;utm_source=berush&amp;utm_medium=promo&amp;utm_campaign=link_landing_page:_all-in-one_marketing_toolkit" target="_blank">SEMrush </a>or Ahrefs, but it suits my needs perfectly.</li><li>Do a search for your topic and start collating and creating keywords with monthly search volume &gt; 500 and keyword difficulty &lt; 30. Go after long-tail keywords if you can’t find any.</li><li>If you’re new to this, I haven’t found a better resource than <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/keyword-research/?ref=SimonBlogs" target="_blank">Neil Patel’s guide to keyword research.</a></li><li>When you’re done, you should have a good idea of the amount of monthly traffic you can generate (remember, you’re going to have to rank on the first page for those search terms to get a <em>portion </em>of that traffic!).</li><li>Giving hard and fast rules about traffic volume and keyword difficulty targets is difficult.</li><li>Andrew Boscini put it well to me on Twitter the other day:</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52453067ff4556a6074b_1*hPVtmGrOkuYQX1g7uGPTmQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you going for a ton of traffic that converts in the low % range, or are you going more niche, with very high search intent?</p><p>I’d also recommend snooping around the following forums/places to get a sense for the community you’re diving into and what the pain points are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reddit </strong>(Find all the applicable sub-reddits)</li><li><strong>Quora </strong>(What questions are people asking)</li><li><strong>Websites</strong>/<strong>Forums </strong>(Who are you competing with)</li><li><strong>Wikipedia </strong>(What information can I give on this niche)</li><li><strong>Twitter </strong>(Do a search and see who the top authorities in the space are)</li><li><strong>Facebook Groups </strong>(How many are they, are they engaged or spammy?)</li></ul><p>As you pick up on areas of discussion, do a search for them as they relate to your niche in the keyword finder and add all those keywords to your list too.</p><h2>✍🏽 Content</h2><p>That’s the fun part done.</p><p>Now that you’ve got your keyword list defined, you need to start writing content. Religiously.</p><p>This is where most people fail on niche sites. They write a few (maybe 5 or 6) articles, and then they get bored and move on. That’s why I said earlier you need to pick a niche that you’re interested in.</p><p>As a guideline, you’re likely going to need to write 100-odd pieces of content in a year.</p><p>If you think that’s unachievable in the niche you’ve selected (because you’ll get bored or otherwise) you have two choices:</p><ol role="list"><li>Go back to the step above and choose a different niche that you’re going to be interested enough in.</li><li>Hire writers (money required).</li></ol><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Once you’ve decided on your niche, start writing. Open a Google Doc and begin on your first piece of content. Aim to put out 2 or 3 pieces for 3 or 4 days back to back.</li><li>You should be going after your most valuable keyword’s (high search, low keyword difficulty) first.</li><li>After 3 or 4 days, you’ll have a good idea for the tone/style of your content and you’ll be better positioned to register a domain and setup a home for your content.</li><li>Try and follow the theme of the example domains I showed above. Preferably including one of the main keywords which describes your niche in the url.</li><li>Don’t get hung up if the ideal .com domain isn’t available. There are other options:</li></ol><ul role="list"><li>Your country’s domain extension (only do this if you’re looking to only attract an audience in your own country)</li><li>.co is a great option</li><li>.io is well recognized in the tech-space</li></ul><p>Your domain name is not the be-all and end-all. A nice one is nice to have, but it’s not essential.</p><p>6. Without a doubt, Wordpress is the best option for a quick and easy setup.</p><p>Your domain/hosting provider will likely have some sort of installer for Wordpress available in the backend (Softaculous, usually) which will do it for you.</p><p>7. Install a theme. I get mine from <a href="https://creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress/blog?u=simonpurdon10" target="_blank">Creative Market.</a></p><p>Again, don’t get hung up on the details. You’ll be surprised by how little people care about the nitty-gritty things that seem to be a big deal to the website-owner.</p><p>If your site works well, looks reasonably good, loads quickly, with great content — that’ll do.</p><p>8. Post your content. Add images. Add external links (more on this later).</p><p>9. Add a method of collecting email addresses! Don’t just have a generic “Join our newsletter” either. No one wants to join just another newsletter.</p><p>Give your readers an actual incentive for signing up: “Join our newsletter for exclusive access to subscriber-only content”.</p><p>10. Remember to install:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO plugin</a> (for on-site SEO help)</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Facebook Pixel</li></ul><h2>🖱️ Traffic</h2><p>Now for the most important (but also the most tedious, for me) part: <strong>Driving traffic.</strong></p><p>Putting up content and hoping …</p></div></div>

<br></div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The American technology giant
Apple has taken legal action against a small company called Prepear, which is
an application and service that makes it easier for people to plan their meals
and find new recipes. The cause of action: Prepear chose to use a pear-shaped
fruit as its logo, which is too similar to Apple's logo, according to a message
posted on Instagram by the company's founders. The message describes Apple's
action as "a blow to Prepear," and indicates the intention to keep
the original logo and "send a message to large technology companies that
intimidation of small businesses has consequences.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

I know there are a lot of heavy things going on in the world right now, and this is nothing in comparison, but I need your help in a situation that is affecting me, my family, and my coworkers. Please help! Many of you know that I started a business called Prepear almost 5 years ago. It is an app that you can store all your recipes in one place, plan your meals, make grocery lists, and get your groceries delivered all in one place. Recently @apple yes, The trillion dollar Apple, has decided to oppose and go after our small business’ trademark saying our pear logo is too close to their apple logo and supposedly hurts their brand? This is a big blow to us at Prepear. To fight this it will cost tens of thousands of dollars. The CRAZY thing is that Apple has done this to dozens of other other small business fruit logo companies, and many have chosen to abandon their logo, or close doors. While the rest of the world is going out of their way to help small businesses during this pandemic, Apple has chosen to go after our small business. I’m not trying to get anyone to stop using or buying Apple products. I feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple's aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.

<span lang="EN-US">The Prepear company has been in
existence for 5 years. It is an application that allows users to store all
their recipes in one place, plan their meals, make shopping lists and have
their groceries delivered to the same place. The application is a derivative of
Super Healthy Kids, which offers recipes and feeding strategies and shares tips
and organizational tools for parents. The founders say they are facing
litigation from Apple. Apple is said to disagree with the Prepear logo, arguing
that its attributes are too similar to its own logo.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"Apple opposed
the trademark application for our small company, Prepear, requiring us to
change our logo, which is obviously pear-shaped, used to represent our brand in
recipe management and meal planning,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> wrote the founders
of Prepear in a post on Instagram asking for help. Prepear is a small company
with only five employees, and the founders say legal fees have already cost
them "several thousand dollars", plus the dismissal of one team
member, in their legal battle against the iPhone manufacturer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Prepear is asking users to sign to ask Apple to drop its opposition to the
Prepear logo and "help prevent large technology companies from abusing

<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear also points out that
before "<i>attacking us, Apple opposed dozens of other trademark
applications filed by small companies with fruit-related logos.</i> According
to Prepear, many of these small companies have had to change their logos or
even give up and shut down, as the limited means of most of them did not allow
them to fight the iPhone manufacturer in a lawsuit costing tens of thousands of
dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"It's a very
terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the world's largest
companies, even though we clearly haven't done anything wrong, and we
understand why most companies just give in and change their logos</span></i><span lang="EN-US">," the Prepear
founders' message on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard" target="_blank">Change.org</a> says.

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Sending a message
against the bullying of small businesses by the largest technology companies</span></span></b></h2>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear, Apple has
opposed small businesses with fruit-related logos by launching costly lawsuits,
even when these logos do not resemble the Apple logo at all or are not in the
same industry as Apple. <i>"We're defending ourselves against Apple not
only to keep our logo, but also to send a message to large technology companies
that intimidation of small businesses has consequences,"</i> said the
company's founders.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The iPhone In Canada website says
it received, on Sunday, more details on the trademark application for the
pear-shaped logo of Prepear, a free application available for download on iOS
and Android. In an email sent to the website, chief operating officer Russ
Monson says Prepear has been registering its trademark for the logo since
January 2017 and that the U.S. trademark office finally told it "<i>that
it was not in conflict with other registered trademarks and that it would
publish it for opposition.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Everything seemed to
be coming to an end when, on the</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> "<i>last day of the
opposition period for the trademark, we were informed that Apple had requested
an extension of the opposition period, and then requested further extensions,
which placed our trademark in a legal limbo for a long period of time".<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<div>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear's email,
Apple filed its effective opposition on the last day it was legally entitled to
do so. According to Monson, the additional extensions filed resulted in
additional legal costs for the small company, and to him, these extensions
"seemed to have been designed by their legal team to be as long, difficult
and expensive as possible for us.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Monson goes on to explain that
Prepear was "naive enough" to think that they could discuss the issue
with Apple in a rational manner, as the two logos are different. But this was
not the case and the opposition has now reached the "discovery
phase", which, according to the COO, "will be the most expensive part
of this case for us". However, Prepear decided to move on to this phase at
Apple's request.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"We believe that
this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple's
position on this issue, Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than
let the public see how it is clearly hurting us for no apparent justifiable
reason,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> said Monson in his email to iPhone In Canada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Other companies have
already changed their logos as a result of Apple's lawsuits.</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Some companies whose logos
(below) were attacked by Apple under the same conditions have given up. But the
founders of Prepear say they are lucky enough to attract enough media attention
"to expose this practice by Apple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Other logos have also been the
source of legal actions brought by Apple in the past, such as the case against
a Norwegian political party and a German bicycle path. The logo of the
political party in question depicts a red apple with a stem, a green leaf and
has the letter F in white on the front. Apple wrote a letter to the Norwegian

<span lang="EN-US">In 2009, Apple also attacked
Woolworths, an Australian supermarket chain, which had just changed its logo.
Woolworths insisted at the time that its logo is nothing more or less than a
stylized "W", but Apple claimed it was an apple and therefore asked
them to stop using it! Hans Hulsbosch, the creator of the logo, said at the
time that the protection of the Apple logo was "taken to extremes".
"Based on this logic, they should attack all fruit sellers.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

"stop attacking small businesses in frivolous affairs that seem designed
to make them spend so much money and time thinking about the business instead
of focusing on how to grow business and ensure to survive the current economic
crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The petition on Change.org has
now received 20,000 signatures, and Prepear hopes that Apple will drop the case

<p>I use Spotify on my computer from time to time but I hate when the Ads start playing.</p>

<p>The first solution I was using was blocking Spotify Ads DNS’s, but that stopped working after a while.</p>

<p>I don’t mind having a <strong>break</strong> between a few songs, but I don’t wanna hear the Ads, so I decided to create a small script to hack it.</p>

<p>The script does the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using OSX log system I can listen to Spotify events.</li>
  <li>Read the events and check if an Ad is about to be played.</li>
  <li>If the event is an Ad about to be played <strong>automatically mute system audio</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the next event is a song, <strong>unmute system audio</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<ol>
  <li>Open a new terminal (use Spotlight search and type <strong>terminal.app</strong>)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Inside the new window paste this command and then hit enter</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> mkdir -p ~/MuteSpotifyAds &amp;&amp; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdi3d/mute-spotify-ads-mac-osx/master/NoAdsSpotify.sh &gt; ~/MuteSpotifyAds/NoAdsSpotify.sh
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>This will create a new folder inside your Home folder called <code>MuteSpotifyAds</code> and will place a new file called <code>NoAdsSpotify.sh</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>To run the program just copy and paste the code below in the terminal and hit enter</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> sh ~/MuteSpotifyAds/NoAdsSpotify.sh
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Open Spotify and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<p>To close the program just <strong>close the terminal app or press Ctrl+c</strong></p>



<p>I used to have all the Spotify Ads DNS blocked but that stopped working.</p>

<p>Besides, I was bored that Saturday noon and I wanted to give it a try.</p>

August 9, 2020 | https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend Juan Paucar directed me to a paper from the magnificent <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030171834">Programming Languages and Systems
28th European Symposium on Programming, ESOP 2019</a>, related to Codata. I have been very interested in codata, mainly because it relates to data in a category-theory way, but, as usual, I didn't understand many of the words involved. This paper helped me understand a lot, and also helped me understand and shape my mind on how to connect the worlds of FP and OOP. But, before that, we must go on tour over a bit of theory.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Data, better understood as Haskell's <code>data</code> declaration, is nothing more than a type and a bunch of ways (functions) to create values of that type. I'm going to use the GADT syntax just because it makes the functions visible. Here is an example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the folks that don't grasp GADTs yet, the above is equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>Foo1</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Foo2</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But with the GADT syntax we can see the functions. <code>Foo1</code> is a constructor, but also a function. <code>Foo1</code> receives an Int and a String, and constructs a value of type <code>Foo</code>. Exactly the same happens with <code>Foo2</code>.</p>
<p>We just talked about constructors: a constructor is nothing more than a function that manufactures a value out of other values. But that pretty much defines every function as a constructor, which isn't helpful. We'll go a bit further: a constructor is a "primitive" function that makes a value of type T, and is not build out of other functions that make a value of type T. Also, a constructor is the function you define when you write a <code>data</code> declaration.</p>
<p>If there are constructors, there should be something that dismantles data, because data seems to be constructed by aggregating values. This thing that deconstructs data is called "eliminators". The universal eliminator in Haskell is the <code>case</code> statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>case</code> statement accepts a parameter (what you put between the <code>case</code> and the <code>of</code>) and returns a value of some type. That's why all the branches in a <code>case</code> statement must have the same type, because when you write a <code>case</code> statement, you are writing a function like <code>mycase :: Foo -&gt; X</code>, but with a nicer syntax.</p>
<p>This means eliminators are not always in the shape of <code>case</code> statements. In reality, eliminators are just functions, and Haskell provides special syntax for these functions to be written in a better way. But, if we go to Lisp, for example, we also have constructors and eliminators.</p>
<p>In Lisp you can manufacture a list with a new head by using the constructor <code>cons</code> (this is why these data structure is called a <code>cons-cell</code>). <code>cons</code> is just another function with two parameters: the head and the tail of the list to be constructed, and returns the list. To destructure a cons-list, you have two eliminators: <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. <code>car</code> takes a list and returns the head, <code>cdr</code> takes the list and returns the tail.</p>
<p>Haskell also offers eliminators, but everyone frowns at you if you use them too much: when you declare a record datatype, Haskell helpfully creates functions to access each of the fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fooField1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fooField2</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>}</span>




</code></pre></div>
<p>Everyone frowns at you when you use these accessors because if <code>FooRecord</code> has more than a single constructor, and you use an eliminator for the other constructor, your program blows up in flames. This is no different to how <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> blow up in flames when you pass as parameter an empty list.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is that <code>data</code> is a declaration that offers a bunch of different ways to create a value, and your program chooses which one interests you for the current case.</p>
<h2>Category Theory</h2>
<p>Category Theory is a branch of Mathematics mainly used by haskellers to annoy everyone else. But, believe it or not, it's also useful to reason about programs. In Category Theory we have objects and we have arrows that interconnect the objects. For something to be a Category, its objects and arrows have to obey some rules.</p>
<p>One of the constructs of Category Theory is the co-category. A co-category is a category where the arrows have been reversed. If in category X, an arrow goes from A to B, in the category co-X, the arrow goes from B to A.</p>
<p>At this point, "codata" should be suspicious to you. It totally looks like "co-data", the co-category of "data". But, how does it actually look the category of "data"?</p>
<h3>The Category of data</h3>
<p>The "data" category is revealed to us as the <code>data</code> declaration. Let's have another look at the <code>Foo</code> example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case (but not in all categories) the types are the objects and the functions are the arrows. If we massage a little bit the code above, by using uncurrying, we can get to a data format that is a bit less arrow-ish and easier for our purposes:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now <code>Foo1</code> takes a pair of Int and String and returns a <code>Foo</code>, and <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Bool</code> and returns a <code>Foo</code>. This is pretty much what every haskeller already knows: you don't have a <code>Foo</code> via <code>Foo1</code> until you provide both the <code>Int</code> and the <code>String</code>, no matter how many arrows are in the middle.</p>
<p>And now, the case statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's massage it a little bit to turn it into a function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fooEliminator</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Foo</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>fooEliminator</span> <span>(</span><span>myfoo</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have converted <code>case</code> into a plain old function, we don't need to do hand-waiving and magic because everything is now plain old function composition and application. Also, all the uncurrying that all the haskellers are about to complain is just going to help us.</p>
<h3>The co-Category of data: co-data</h3>
<p>I massaged all these expressions and uncurried them because, otherwise it is confusing. I mean, a co-category is a category with the arrows flipped. Which poses the question: which arrows? All of them? Some of them? Everything is easier if there is a single arrow: it means we don't have to go figuring out which one.</p>
<p>So let's flip the arrow of the <code>Foo</code> data declaration, and let's see what comes out.</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>
<span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I happily renamed <code>data</code> to <code>codata</code>, and flipped the single arrow in each line. Let's massage it a little bit more by flipping the order of the arguments so that the arrow points to the right, because we are accustomed to see the arrow functions that way:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What does this mean? Well, a lot of things at the same time, but let's go one by one.</p>
<p>We have two functions related to the <code>codata Foo</code>. The first, called <code>Foo1</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a pair of Int and String. The second, called <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a <code>Bool</code>. We have two functions that take what seems to be a composite value <code>Foo</code> and extract simple values from it of types <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>The same way that we could call any of the two functions in the <code>data Foo</code> declaration, we can call any of the two functions in the <code>codata Foo</code>, and get an <code>(Int, String)</code> for the first case, and a <code>Bool</code> for the second. Nothing forces us to call both, and we can just call any one of them.</p>
<p>If we have a <code>Foo</code>, and by calling <code>Foo1</code> we get simple values from it, this looks a lot like a eliminator. But we can also call <code>Foo2</code>, which looks like another eliminator.</p>
<p>Trying to make sense of all of this, we reach a deep insight:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code> is about how we can call any of the many different constructors of a composite value.</li>
<li><code>codata</code> is about how we can call any of the many different eliminators of a composite value.</li>
</ul>
<p>From it, we can derive further insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codata looks a lot like objects and methods, where the codata value is the object, and the eliminators are the methods. There is probably some theorem out there that maps codata as a category to objects in OO programs.</li>
<li>It's not that Functional Programming is superior to Object Oriented Programming. But, the usual Functional Programmer has been an Object Oriented Programmer before. Because of this, he is likely to know <code>codata</code> from OO, and now is starting to understand <code>data</code> from FP. As a result of this, he is better armed than an Object Oriented Programmer because an Object Oriented Programmer only knows <code>codata</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further philosophical details can be extracted from the duality data-codata:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we were to find a pure FP programmer, and a pure OO programmer, they would probably have a similar level of skill, but in totally different dimensions. This would make very hard to actually figure out who is the most skilled, because their skill-sets wouldn't be comparable! How do you compare skill-set in <code>data</code> with skill-set in <code>codata</code>?</li>
<li>Data (and Functional Programming) deals on how we can construct complex datatypes from simple ones by using constructors. Codata (and Object Oriented Programming) deals on how we can extract the components from an object by calling its methods.</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> states that you should be able to add new cases and new functions to a datatype without losing type safety and without having to recompile.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an OO language, you can add a new case by creating another subclass and implementing the methods. But, if you want to add a new function to a datatype, you have to add it to the superclass and implement it on all the existing subclasses, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
<li>In a FP language you can add a new function to an existing datatype just by adding a function. But, if you want to add a new case, you have to add the constructor and modify all the functions that use the datatype, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out, with our new data-codata knowledge, that we have a deeper insight into the Expression Problem, and …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to Part 2 of my shameless attempt at explaining Docker to beginners. I struggled so you don't have to!</p>
<p>In last week's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.antoniolofiego.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-containers-a-foolproof-hands-on-docker-tutorial-part-1-ckdc4tni0031759s14z0pdd2j">article</a> we covered what Docker is, some of its jargon, and why it outperforms VMs in many use cases in today's typical software development lifecycle. This week we'll go deeper into running Docker on our machines, all while figuring out the most interesting and useful underlying technicalities.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3aGZA6WLI9Jde/giphy.gif" alt="Let's go!"></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-docker">Getting started with Docker</h2>
<p>If you don't have Docker installed on your machine, head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker Download page</a> to get the version that will work on your system.</p>
<p>The Linux version is the easiest to install, given that Docker is built off of Linux utilities. On Mac and Windows, on the other hand, there are two main ways of using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>
The newer and recommended version of Docker. It is a native solution that works directly along with your OS's processes, so we are free to interface with Docker with your favorite terminal and your favorite IDE/text editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a>
This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.013MB
Step 1/6 : FROM node:11-alpine

<p>As we can see, each instruction is carefully followed. On each step, Docker creates a <strong>layer</strong>. Every image is built out of several read-only layers, with each layer corresponding to certain instructions in your Dockerfile. Each step builds …</p></div></div>

<p>Developing enterprise-grade web apps from scratch using open-source front-end and backend frameworks takes a long time. Nowadays, customers are looking for quick and cost-effective solutions and are gravitating towards using no-code and low-code app development platforms. How can full-stack developers thrive in this new world of no-code and low-code platforms?</p>



<h2><strong>No-code and Low-code Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>One purpose of these platforms is to increase the pool of available web app developers by tapping into the broader workforce of non-technical and semi-technical employees. Vendors have developed no-code platforms to be used by non-technical employees to build simple applications, and low-code platforms to be used by employees with basic technical skills (ex: SQL, JavaScript) to develop more complex enterprise applications. Secondly, these platforms can reduce web app development time by over 50% compared to the traditional web app development method.</p>



<p>Currently, there are a large number of vendors competing in the no-code and low-code market segments. No-code platform vendors include AppSheet (Google), Betty Blocks, QuickBase, Airtable, Bubble, and Microsoft PowerApps. Low-code platform vendors include Microsoft PowerApps, OutSystems, Mendix, Salesforce Lightning Platform, Nintex, Appian, and Pegasystems.</p>



<p>We won’t discuss no-code platforms because they cater to non-technical employees and are used for developing simple apps. It’s unlikely that you, as a web developer, will be asked to work on the no-code platform to build web apps.</p>



<p>Low-code platforms, on the other hand, are used to develop more complex apps. Working on developing a web app using these low-code platforms has several disadvantages for a professional web developer who is used to developing apps using open technologies such as front-end and back-end frameworks. Here is a<a href="https://medium.com/@michaelhenderson/why-outsystems-ruined-my-dev-job-3119828fd051"> blog post</a> from a professional web developer about his experiences working on one of these low-code platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-1</strong>: No control over source code</p>



<p>Low-code platforms provide a visual metaphor to develop web apps. Even the app’s business logic is implemented by dragging and dropping code control statements such as if/then/else. Therefore, developers working on these platforms have little control over source code. Not having control over source code creates at least two issues: (a) It’s challenging to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic, (b) debugging problems can be very difficult and frustrating.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-2</strong>: Career Limiting</p>



<p>Working full-time on a low-code platform can be career-limiting for professional web developers. They would lose their current technical skills in open programming languages and frameworks and gain skills in a proprietary low-code platform. Suppose this proprietary low-code platform is not widely adopted across employers, which is currently the case for any specific low-code platform. In that case, the developer’s low-code platform skills can only be used at another employer who has also adopted the same low-code platform. This severely limits the career mobility of the developer.</p>



<p>Is there a better option? Yes. Why not build a low-code platform for professional web app developers that satisfies both the employers’ need for speed and developers’ needs for control and career mobility? How do we achieve this? Read on …</p>



<h2><strong>Automate Boilerplate Code Generation</strong></h2>



<p>When developing web applications, there is quite a bit of cut/paste/modify work.</p>



<p>Most of the applications I have developed have used an N-layered architecture. In this architecture, to provide a ReST API for the CRUD operations on a database table (entity), we need to develop code for the entity, the DAO (Data Access Object) layer, the services layer, and the ReST controller layer. Similarly, to create UI screens to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations, we need to develop UI components and a front-end services layer that interacts with the back-end ReST API. Once this work is completed for a single database table (entity), similar work must be repeated for each table of the database schema. Imagine having to do this for 50 database tables – this is tedious and error-prone work.</p>



<p>A better approach would be to automate the generation of boilerplate code. To automate, we can develop an application generator that reads the database schema and generates the back-end and front-end code to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations on database tables (entities).</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Add-ons for Functional Cross-cutting Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>Over time, I have noticed that web applications have many functional cross-cutting concerns that repeat across applications. Examples of functional cross-cutting concerns include Authentication &amp; Authorization, Document management, Transactional Emails, Jobs Scheduler, User Registration, and Embedded Reporting. Almost every web application I have been involved in developing required each of these capabilities. In each case, my development team reinvented the wheel and built these cross-cutting concerns from scratch because we never thought about building generic and customizable functional cross-cutting concerns that can be used across web apps- what a waste of effort &amp; time!</p>



<p>If the base code for such functional cross-cutting concerns was already built and available, we could have re-used it and customized it as needed for each web application.</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Visual Development Tools</strong></h2>



<p>Developing enterprise applications involves developing custom functionality such as designing a database schema or domain model, building custom screens for non-CRUD operations, building enterprise-specific themes (colors, fonts), and developing integrations with external systems.</p>



<p>Professional development teams can further reduce the application development time &amp; cost by using visual development tools that accelerate the development of these custom functionality artifacts.</p>



<h2><strong>Support Development Team’s Preferred Stack</strong></h2>



<p>When developing enterprise applications, professional development teams have specific preferences over open technologies used, such as front-end and back-end frameworks, Object-relational mapping tools, UI Component frameworks, and dependency management systems. Specific technologies are preferred by teams either because they are the enterprise architecture standard or because most team members have experience using these technologies.</p>



<p>By supporting the specific technologies chosen by development teams, open low-code platforms for professional developers can help and not reduce the acceleration of application development.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The approach mentioned above allows development teams to reduce the time to develop a web app by over 50%, similar to proprietary low-code platforms. Additionally, developers have full control over the source code, eliminating their inability to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic and easily debug issues. Finally, developers use open technologies when developing web apps, eliminating the problem of limited career mobility.</p>



<p>In summary, a low-code platform built for professional web app developers eliminates the disadvantages of proprietary low-code platforms while preserving their advantage of rapid app development.</p>

					<p>Violent scenes are taking place this evening in Minsk, Belarus, where law enforcement officials, with President Aleksandr Lukashenko, are battling the contestants.</p>
<p>The protests began after the official exit poll released on Sunday evening at the end of the presidential election, which credits the eternal Aleksandr Lukashenko with nearly 80% of the vote, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53717834">BBC News</a> and <a href="https://tass.com/world/1187449">Tass</a>.</p>

<p>The images posted on Facebook, <a href="https://monetize.info/telegram-bots/">Telegram groups</a> and Twitter by independent journalists in Belarus show huge crowds of people in Minsk, but also in other cities of the country – Gomel, Brest or Baranovichi. In the latter two reportedly, police withdrew from the central area in front of thousands of protesters.</p>

<p>On the same evening, according to exit polls, <strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko</strong> would have won the election again by 79.7%, while opposition candidate <strong>Svetlana Tihanovskaia</strong> would have won only 6.8% of the suffrages.</p>
<p>The country’s authoritarian leader has previously said that everything will remain “under control”. However, independent journalists in Belarus say that citizens are angry and convinced that the elections have been rigged.</p>
<p>Opposition candidate Svetlana Tihanovskaia’s spokeswoman claimed her victory based on “real” results from 20 polling stations. The official asked the Central Election Commission to declare the correct results on Monday. Tihanovskaia herself urged police not to forget “that it is part of the nation.” “I know that citizens will wake up tomorrow in a new country and I hope that tomorrow will bring good news. Stop the violence. officers, I know you can do it,” the opposition candidate said. Several polling station presidents came out in front of citizens to announce what they call the “real” results of the vote. In the clip below, Tihanovskaia is announced winning by 90%.</p>

<p><strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko is in his sixth term as president of Soviet-state Belarus and has ruled the country since 1994.</strong> He is in office for the longest time of all European heads of state (except monarchs). In Belarusian society, the “Old Man” is unofficially called.</p>

Firefox's reader mode suggests a reading time of about 30 minutes, and there's many links in here that will each add a few minutes to that time.</p><h2 id="my-perspective">My perspective</h2><p>Here's a little background about where I come into this. I joined Discord in mid-2016, pretty early in its life, and since then I've used it to make a lot of friends and deal with tough times. I've enjoyed using Discord and I've seen it introduce a lot of features over time like the new server settings screen, channel categories, server folders, the audit log, and paid subscriptions, which I have paid for. I've participated in the API chats and I've developed several bots, <a href="https://amanda.moe/">one of which</a> has been seeing active development for 2 years, is in 2200 servers and counting, and has 466 hours of code from me since I started counting in 2019, all done at no personal gain for myself. All done because I wanted people to be happy on Discord.</p><p>I used to like Discord. I used to call myself a fan of Discord. But now, I can't put its problems behind me any more.</p><p>I've moved my communities off Discord, or bridged them with Matrix, or transferred them to other people and left them. I'm down to 3 servers from 86, all of which are bridged, so I don't have to open Discord to see them. I'm in the process of purging all of my messages. I likely won't delete my account, because I do occasionally need to log in to attend to something, and deleting my account would do basically nothing. More on that later.</p><p>Here's why I'm ditching Discord.</p><h2 id="poorly-managed">The product is poorly managed</h2><p>There are so many outstanding bugs in Discord that we've all just collectively forgotten about over time. Here's a cute list of a few at the front of my mind:</p><ul><li>Ghost mentions and ghost unreads! Write a message, perhaps with a mention in it, then delete the message. For everyone else, the unread marker and the mention badge remain, even though there's nothing there when you open the channel.</li><li>Bots can't accept calls, and yet, right click a bot in a server and select "call" from the context menu. This one is REALLY funny, you should actually try this one. Interestingly, they bothered to fix this for the SYSTEM user, but not for bots.</li><li>People can only set about 250 notes on other users. After you reach that limit, new notes are silently rejected by the server, and will be gone when you open the profile again. There's no way to see a list of people with notes to delete them on.</li><li>The server region selector is always light themed.</li><li>The download apps screen is always light themed.</li><li>The add server dialogue is always light themed.</li><li>Every server has a member limit that has to be manually raised by Discord staff. If a server has reached this limit, it may still show in the server explorer, but when you click the join button it will load forever. The API request failed in the background with a suitable message, but they never made UI for it. This happens on a few servers on the front page of the server explorer, like CallMeCarson.</li></ul><p>These are not new issues. The calling issue has happened since the beginning of time. The theme issues have happened since the beginning of time. The note limit has existed since the beginning of time. The server member limit issue has existed since the server explorer was added.</p><p>I'd post more examples, but they're harder to find because a few months ago Discord staff wiped the bug report boards, deleting several years of issue reports. These issues still persist to this day.</p><p>These are not big issues. They do not affect how I use the app day-to-day. However, they are evidence of a much more serious problem: Discord staff either do not care about these issues, are too overworked and understaffed to deal with them, or are simply too incompetent to fix them. More on this later.</p><p>There's more evidence of incompetence. For a while we had server audit logs, which let you track if somebody deleted a message — but not if somebody used the bulk delete messages endpoint. That wasn't tracked at all. Oops. It's a thing now, but we've gone at least one or two years without it. <a href="https://cadence.moe/i/abc28e">Oops.</a></p><p>So what have staff being doing instead of polishing these issues and making the app actually look professional? They've been <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/gdkzyn/introducing_tabs_to_android/">changing the mobile UI, clearly without consulting people that actually use the app, and everyone hates it.</a> Oops.</p><h3 id="disabilities">Subsection: Disabilities</h3><p>Perhaps the longest outstanding issue in the app was the contrast ratio of ordinary text. On light theme, the text contrast against the background was somewhere around 2.2:1 (the <em>minimum</em> to be WCAG AA accessible is 4.5:1), meaning it was extremely difficult to actually <em>read text in the app designed for reading text</em> unless you have perfect vision and an accurate monitor. This was eventually resolved for <em>most parts of the app</em>, but shortly afterwards they changed embed titles from perfectly fine to not accessible, which is terrible and shows that they don't actually care and that they haven't changed.</p><p>The pattern of complete disregard for disabilities continues when they made messages highlight when you hovered them with the cursor. As you scroll this page right now, I'm sure that your mouse is hovering over it somewhere. Now imagine that the colours of the paragraph you were hovering over significantly changed as you scrolled and moved the mouse. I actually would have quit using Discord immediately if I didn't have the technical knowledge to figure out where the styles came from and modify the colours to make it not do this — which is actually against terms of service. I have to break terms of service to make the app usable. Cool.</p><p>If you don't see why this is a big deal, it's incredibly distracting for people who have austism, ADHD, or related issues. For me, my mind focuses too much on what is happening on screen, making it impossible for me to actually read and understand the messages. I actually cannot use the app with that setting turned on.</p><p>Do you lack the fine motor control to use the mouse pointer? Perhaps you don't have hands to move it with, or perhaps tremors prevent you from pointing accurately. Sucks to be you, because the app is almost unusable with the keyboard. You cannot use the tab key to move around different sections, because it's been overridden to always focus the text field. Even if you could use the tab key, the focus ring is overridden to be invisible, so you have no idea what will be activated when you press Enter. You might think that it's hard to make entirely keyboard accessible UI. It might be hard, but it's definitely not impossible. Look at Visual Studio Code, an app with similar layout, that is completely keyboard accessible.</p><p>In the beginning, there were no video calls. Then video calls and screen share was added to DM and group DM calls, and people were happy. They wanted server video calls, but didn't have them. Not a huge deal.</p><p>Then somebody discovered that you could fashion a link which would transport you inside the voice channel, which had extremely good UI for video calls and screen sharing, <em>and it worked.</em> Video call and screen share in servers existed and it worked perfectly.</p><p>Then nothing changed about this for 18 months. Screen share still appeared to be DMs only, while still functioning perfectly in servers if you know how to make the link. 18 months of this being a hidden feature that was completely functional.</p><p>Then Go Live came out, and at first, it sucked. Originally it would only let you screen share registered games, and not video call. Then it would let you screen share any application, but not video call. And finally, more than 6 months after the launch of Go Live, they added buttons to open video call and screen share with the current channel. It took a total of 2 years to make this <em>extremely useful and perfectly functional</em> hidden feature into a visible feature.</p><h3 id="communication">Subsection: Communication</h3><p>Discord is a communications app. You think this would let the staff effectively communicate important information to you, and perhaps you could opt in or out of specifc channels, like update notes, developer announcements, technical analysis, stuff like that. Not so. Communication with Discord is unbelievably disorganised.</p><p>Discord has a blog. Discord has the outage reporter. Discord has email lists. Discord has Twitter. Discord writes on GitHub. Discord has pretty much everything except, well, Discord. The only messages that you can be sure to receive are the SYSTEM messages if they decided that it's time to show them your passport. The information that's sent through these different communication routes is also different, so you need to subscribe to all of them. There's also about a billion satellite servers that you have to join to get important information, especially if you're a bot developer. A lot of important information about bot verification, a move which will <em>literally lock people out of the platform if they don't understand what to do,</em> I only find out about when random people post it in servers that I happen to be in. Apparently there's a "Discord Developers" server where they post announcements about this. I have no idea how to get into that server.</p><h2 id="downtime">Downtime</h2><p>Discord wants to be the communication route that you can use for everything. …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text"> <figure> <img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/1.jpg" alt="Human with information overload"> </figure>  <p>Have you ever struggled to find information inside your knowledge base or note-taking app? When you did find what you needed, was it after a long time searching and wading through lots of results?</p> <p>If so, this is likely because of information overload - when every human being has access to the sum of all human knowledge, finding any specific bit of it becomes a daunting task.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/2.jpg" alt="Human running away from too much information"></p> <p>For the modern knowledge worker, the amount of information we need to track far exceeds what can actually fit in our heads. As a consequence, we externalize that information using tools like Evernote, Notion, and Confluence.</p>  <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/3b.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker using Evernote, notion, and confluence to organize information"></p> <p>The problem with these tools is that the more information we put in, the harder it becomes to get it back out. This is because existing tools lack the capability of organizing large amounts of information and why most of us rely on search to find what we need.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/4.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker organizing information using notion, Evernote, and confluence"></p>  <p>Search is great when you are looking through <strong>the internet</strong>, <strong>know what you’re looking for</strong> and need <strong>a good result</strong>. For example, a google search for “the height of Mt Everest” will give you exactly what you need.</p> <p>Search fails when you are looking through your <strong>knowledge base</strong>, might <strong>not know the exact query</strong>, and are looking for a <strong>highly specific result.</strong> For example, say you saved an article about government tax breaks. Searching those exact terms together might yield no results but searching for “government” or “tax” individually might flood your screen with non-relevant data.</p>  <p>The fundamental problem with a search centric model for managing information is that it is based on keywords.</p> <p>Here, a keyword is defined as any term that has ever been or might ever be used in the human language. To get the right result, two things need to happen.</p> <ol> <li>Out of the vast universe of all possible keywords, you need to pick out the right keywords that <strong>match the relevant document you are looking for</strong> when you are <strong>looking for it.</strong></li> <li>Out of the vast universe of all possible keywords, you need to have picked out the right keywords that <strong>you thought might match a future query</strong> when you <strong>first created the document.</strong></li> </ol> <p>The odds of both things happening, especially over long periods, are astronomical. It is like trying to find a star in the night sky by just its description.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/4b.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker finding information using keywords"></p> <p>The reason keywords don’t work is because they require people to do something that the human brain is not good at - working with and remembering an unbounded number of things.</p>  <p>The alternative to keeping track of everything individually is organizing.</p> <p>Here, organizing is defined as a means coming up with systems to simplify your data so that you can more easily access it later.</p> <p>The most common way that people organize information is to group related concepts into topics. By grouping related information, you reduce the cognitive load required to keep track of individual items.</p> <p>The psychological term for this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and it is something that the brain is naturally good at. Even unconsciously, we will create associations between things. This process is so powerful that we now have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_bias_training">unconcious bias training</a> to <strong>train ourselves not to do this</strong> when it results in discriminatory behavior.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/5b.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker chunking information into topics"></p> <h2 id="chunking"> <a href="#chunking" aria-labelledby="chunking"></a> Chunking </h2> <p>The problem with chunking is that it cannot keep up with the sheer amount of information we deal with today.</p> <p>If you try to group all the information into chunks, one of two things will happen.</p> <ol> <li>You have too many chunks and keeping track of chunks becomes overwhelming</li> <li>You have a few chunks with too many things in them which causes you to lose the benefits of chunking in the first place</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/6.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker trying to find information but being overwhelmed with chunks"></p> <h2 id="indirection"> <a href="#indirection" aria-labelledby="indirection"></a> Indirection </h2> <p>The solution to too many chunks is indirection.</p> <blockquote> <p>“All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection” – David Wheeler, Computer scientist</p> </blockquote> <p>When the complexity of information becomes too much at one level, we simplify it with a layer of indirection that pushes the bulk of the complexity to a new level.</p> <p>For information, this means creating hierarchies to group related chunks. We can keep doing this until the number of chunks at any given level of the hierarchy becomes manageable. At this point, our data starts to take the shape of a tree.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/7.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker modeling information as a tree"></p> <h2 id="trees"> <a href="#trees" aria-labelledby="trees"></a> Trees </h2> <p>Trees are one of the most important data structures in computer science and are used extensively in every database ever designed. These are systems that actually store all the world’s information.</p> <p>Finding information in a tree can be done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree#Time_to_search_a_sorted_file">logarithmic time</a> - in layman’s terms, it means you can quickly search through large amounts of data using very small trees. An example of this in real life is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification">dewey decimal system</a>. This system is used by libraries to assign unique identification labels to every book ever published.</p>  <p>Time for a quick recap - the human brain is not good at remembering an endless amount of things. This is why keywords fail. We, therefore, chunk related concepts into topics. This too runs into problems when we end up with too many chunks. The solution to this is to group related chunks using trees.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/7a.jpg" alt="Recap of knowledge worker putting together a tree - Part I"> <img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/7b.jpg" alt="Recap of knowledge worker putting together a tree - Part II"></p> <p>When the number of chunks at any given level exceeds what is easy for us to remember, we can apply <em>another level of indirection</em> by grouping related chunks and pushing it further down the tree.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/9.jpg" alt="Knowledge tree with a layer of indirection applied"></p> <p>This whole process is recursive - you can apply it at any level of the tree as many as times as you need to make the information comprehensible.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/10.jpg" alt="Knowledge tree with multiple layers"></p> <p>This ensures that the number of chunks you need to track at any given level stays comprehensible no matter how much information you have.</p> <p>Thinking about information in terms of trees reflects how humans naturally think about things and there is increasing evidence that the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080423121430.htm">human brain is hard-wired to think in terms of hierarchies</a></p>  <p>Today’s knowledge bases support the concept of trees through the use of folders and tags. But this is not enough. Folders and tags haven’t changed much in the last fifty years and run into the following challenges when used in tree form.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Ability to apply the same tree everywhere</li> <li><strong>Manageability</strong>: Ability to update the tree everywhere</li> <li><strong>Usability</strong>: Ability to quickly find data using the tree</li> </ol> <h2 id="consistency"> <a href="#consistency" aria-labelledby="consistency"></a> Consistency </h2> <p>There’s overhead involved in creating trees. Even simple domains can have dozens of branches. We have enough trouble simply tagging our data, asking us to re-create entire hierarchies for any number of things is simply too much work.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/11c.jpg" alt="Replicating knowledge tree"></p> <h2 id="manageability"> <a href="#manageability" aria-labelledby="manageability"></a> Manageability </h2> <p>A tree-based organization structure tends to be the reflection of our mental model of a particular domain. The thing about mental models is that they change. Either the underlying domain changes or our understanding of it changes. Either way, the structure of the tree changes. But when it does, making sure all our existing trees reflect that change is not easily done with current tools.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/12.jpg" alt="Updating knowledge tree"></p> <h2 id="usability"> <a href="#usability" aria-labelledby="usability"></a> Usability </h2> <p>Even if we organize data as trees, existing tools have little to no support helping us find data using hierarchies. We end up having to manually click through our trees or performing keyword searches that ignore our hierarchies completely.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/13.jpg" alt="Using knowledge tree"></p>  <p>The reason we don’t use trees to organize and find information today is that existing tools make it unfeasible to do so. The means of organizing information in a “modern” knowledge base is the same as it was fifty years ago - folders and tags.</p> <p>Ever since Google became the dominant way to find information on the web, knowledge bases gave up trying to improve on organization. Why organize when you can search? The problem is that <strong>search doesn’t work in these tools</strong> and continues to <strong>get worse as the amount of information we track keeps growing</strong>.</p>  <p>What if we could create a tool that made it possible to organize and find the information we cared about, no matter how much information we had? What could we do with such a tool?</p> <p>Thinking about such a tool is something I’ve done for much of the last decade. More than think about it, I’ve built such a tool and used it to manage a personal knowledge base of +20k notes. This tool has become my second brain and I use it for just about everything that I do.</p> <p>A year ago, I left my job at Amazon to build a consumer-ready version of this tool. It is called <a href="https://dendron.so/">Dendron</a> <del>and will be entering into early access in early May</del> and is now out in <a href="https://www.dendron.so/">preview</a>.</p> <p>Note that using Dendron will not magically make information overload go away. You still have to do the hard work of organizing your information. But Dendron finally gives you a sane way of doing so.</p> <p>This post is not a sales pitch and I’d be lying to say we got it all figured out. Rather, it is an invitation to come along on a journey to find answers to what I consider to be one of the biggest challenges of our age. How do we make sense of the world we live in?</p> <p>If this message resonate, lets connect. You can join the conversation on dendron’s <a href="https://discord.gg/5HbAv3">discord server</a> or contact me directly at kevin@dendron.so.</p> <p>It is said that life is about the journey - what greater journey is there than the one to make sense of it all?</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Thanks</strong> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-sernau-40394648/">Luke Sernau</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilana-l-539930167/">Ilana Lin</a> for proofreading drafts of this</li> <li><strong>Special thanks</strong> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilana-l-539930167/">Ilana Lin</a> for creating the beautiful illustrations in this post</li> </ul> </section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://lazybear.io/img/email.jpg" alt="Email"><p><span>I</span> am the kind of stubborn guy wanting to change
people's demeanor. Around 80 persons switched to Signal around me because I
told them it's better for them and their privacy. And since that's my main tool
to communicate, if they wanted to keep in touch it's Signal or nothing. The
same way, I encourage them to stop using GAFAM products and try ethical
alternatives pointing out <a href="https://switching.software/">Switching Software</a>.</p><p>For example, Gmail is used way too much. In the past, Android mobiles forced you to have a
Google account to be able to use your phone. Now with <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> or <a href="https://e.foundation/">/e/</a>,
it's not mandatory anymore. I hated the fact that they potentially know
your contacts, your agenda and other things about your life. That's why I self-host
everything I can.</p><p>My daughter's school has a newsletter for each classroom and I noticed a
majority of parents are using Gmail. That makes me sick. At some point, I will
probably try to introduce to them other providers like <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> or
<a href="https://tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a>.</p><p>Even when you try to keep your life private, when you communicate with people
using Google it's complicated. Quitting mainstream social media platforms was a
great way to get rid of people I didn't really know or care about. Real friends
are the ones who call me or use Signal because it's <em><strong>my</strong></em> main tool to
communicate. I just ditched the others.</p><p>How people use emails is the main subject of this article so let's focus on that
part.</p><p>I stumbled upon that <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/mailing-list-software-should-stop-spying-on-subscribers/">article</a> about mailing lists and the fact they are
spying on people including <a href="https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/07/superhuman-is-spying-on-you">tracking pixels</a>.</p><p>A term marketing people don't like but by definition :</p><blockquote><p>spy :</p><ol><li>One who secretly collects information concerning the enemies of a government or group.</li><li>One who secretly collects information for a business about one or more of its competitors.</li></ol></blockquote><p>That kind of things can't be done with a simple plain text email.</p><p>HTML in mails was and is still a thing that should be prohibited.</p><p>First, your MUA, a <em>Mail User Agent</em> or commonly known as a mail client, is not
a browser! Stop sending pictures in them or, at least, add them as attached
documents. I used to have an automatic reply in <a href="https://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a> for people sending
HTML saying something like :</p><blockquote><p>Please don't send emails in HTML format. It's bad and I won't reply to you!</p></blockquote><p>Second, people put images in their signature and then add these kinds of
messages :</p><blockquote><p>Please do not print this email unless it is necessary. Every unprinted email helps the environment.</p><p>Is it necessary to print this email? If you care about the environment like we do, please refrain from printing emails. It helps to keep the environment forested and litter-free.</p></blockquote><p>Adding a short message about ecology is great but why add images to your mails
is a bad idea ?</p><p>The carbon footprint of email are approximately something like :</p><ul><li>Spam email, even not opened : 0.3 CO2e</li><li>A proper email : 4g CO2e</li><li>An email with long attachment : 50g CO2e</li></ul><p>To put this into perspective, the carbon output of hitting “send” on 65 mails is
on par with driving an average-sized car a kilometre.</p><p>10 emails with big attachments are like burning 240g of coal.</p><p>The global carbon footprint from spam annually is equivalent to the greenhouse
gases pumped out by 3.1 million passenger cars using 7.6 billion litres (two
billion gallons) of gasoline in a year.</p><p>So please stop adding images or HTML in your emails. Period !</p><p>And my last point is about how people reply to emails and it connects to my last
argument.</p><p>My reference of choice is the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt">RFC-1855</a> also known as the Netiquette
describing how to write emails :</p><blockquote><p>Be brief without being overly terse. When replying to a message,

is extremely bad form to simply reply to a message by including
all the previous message: edit out all the irrelevant material.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>Watch cc's when replying. Don't continue to include

is no longer than 4 lines. Remember that many people pay for

the more they pay.</p></blockquote><p>That Netiquette or how to be polite has been lost over the years.</p><p>Everyone replies above all the previous mails and the worst part is all of them
are included in the current mail. I've seen emails over <strong>1000 lines</strong> just to
say <em>“Thank you”</em> and Cc:ed more than 20 persons.</p><p>That last part is quite a difficult habit to change for a lot of people.
Sometimes people tell me :</p><blockquote><p>- You sent me an empty email!</p><p>- No I didn't I just replied under your message stripping irrelevant parts.</p></blockquote><p>Doing it that way people reading the thread know exactly what the question was
and what you replied to.</p><p>When you reply above all the other messages, you waste time reading previous
emails because you just don't know what was the question and you need to figure
it out between 15 emails sent.</p><p>Microsoft, Gmail and all these new email clients are doing it <em><strong>WRONG</strong></em>. And that
should be known by people, so they can adjust and use email properly again.
Marketers, and their HTML emails, should just be banned from using a MUA.</p><p>Next time, you fire up an email ask yourself how your response could be well
better formatted and not harm the ecology adding big images to them… or HTML.</p><p><span><em>Day 43/100 - Just write and join in <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100DaysToOffload</a>!</em></span></p><p><span><em>Photo credit : <a href="https://unsplash.com/@muukii">Muukii</a></em></span></p></article></div>]]>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is peat?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peat is a type of soil, made up of waterlogged, partially decomposed plant material that has built up over nearly 10,000 years in wetland habitats. It is an important natural resource, as it provides both carbon storage and is a natural flood defense, as it can hold up to 20 times its weight in water!</span></p>
<p><img alt="Beautiful sunrise over peat bogs in North Uist, Scotland." src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/7871/4670/files/shutterstock_1232810863-3.jpg?v=1592164899"></p>
<p><em>Beautiful sunrise over peat bogs in North Uist, Scotland.</em></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why has peat become so popular?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using peat within the gardening industry has been the norm for decades. However, only for the last twenty years have the issues surrounding peat consumption been recognised.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peat has become popular in the gardening world because it retains, and contains natural nutrients, due to the presence of partially decomposed plant material. Peat is also great at holding water, these two combined give plants a great start, with minimal effort. Making it very popular with amateur gardeners. Peat-free compost suppliers cannot compete on price, as making a successful peat-free compost requires more time and processing. Peat-free alternatives can include coir, green compost, wood fibre, and composted bark.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why is using products containing peat bad for the environment?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unless your compost is clearly labelled peat-free, most composts contain a whopping 50-70% peat!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peat that is commonly used in compost is mainly derived from peat bogs. Peat bogs are one of the most important carbon stores, often referred to as carbon sinks. When peat is removed, this quickly releases a large volume of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.</span></p>
<h4><span><strong>As a carbon store peat holds&nbsp;more carbon than the combined forests of Britain, France, and Germany!!</strong></span></h4>
<p><img alt="Peat harvesting on the Isle of Skye, Scotland." src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/7871/4670/files/Peat_mining_2.jpg?v=1592163499"></p>
<p><em>Peat mining on the Isle of Skye, Scotland.</em></p>
<p>These natural peat bogs are being destroyed to keep up with high consumer demand, this has resulted in 94% of the UK’s peat bogs being destroyed. Just 6000 hectares remain untouched.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">62% of our peat now has to be flown in from other countries, as the UK’s supply has dwindled. Flying peat in from Ireland and the Baltic States results in even more carbon being released into the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peat bogs are home to many plant and wildlife species that can only survive in the unique environment the peat bogs provide. Mining the bogs for peat destroys their habitats, and threatens the lives of hundreds of species.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/7871/4670/files/peat_bog_mining.jpg?v=1592163376"></p>
<p><em>Stacks of peat, recently harvested, ready to be sold to the UK market.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why gardeners have been reluctant to change to peat-free</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We are creatures of habit, many gardeners will use compost they have used for years, so they know it is both reliable and works well. Some gardeners also tend to buy the lowest priced compost, this is not usually peat-free. Peat free composts also had a bad reputation up until recently, now they are recognised to be just as good. A&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Which?</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;Survey found that peat-free composts performed better than peat-based rivals in the growing of potted plants and potatoes.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why we are peat-free here at Seed n Sow</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here at Seed n Sow, we pride ourselves on being an environmentally friendly company, we don’t want to cause any unnecessary damage to the earth. That’s why we only give our customers organic, peat-free compost with our <a href="https://seednsow.co.uk/collections/all-in-one-seed-kits" title="All In One" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All In One </a>and <a href="https://seednsow.co.uk/collections/signature-seeds-kits" target="_blank" title="Seed n Sow Signature" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seed n Sow Signature</a> Seed Kits! Our biodegradable seed tray and pots are also peat-free, they are made from 100% fibre, whereas many biodegradable trays and pots&nbsp;available to purchase elsewhere are made up of mostly peat!</span></p>
<h4><span><strong>The government has set out to eliminate all peat use by all gardeners, growers, and procurers by 2030, by switching to peat-free alternatives!</strong></span></h4>
<h2>&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But what can you do?</span></strong>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Be sure to check that any compost you buy has as little peat in as possible, or even better, completely peat-free.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make your own compost to improve your soil, instead of relying on peat-based options. Look out for our blog post on how to make your own compost!</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recycle used compost from pots.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When buying potted plants be sure to check they have been grown in peat-free compost.</span></li>

    <p><img src="https://blog.atkinson.cloud/posts/2020/08/testing_our_way_out/covid19.jpeg"></p><p>We are now approximately 5 months into the sars-cov-2 / covid19 pandemic in the US. Remember when we were a few days
in and we all nodded our heads that after a few weeks of this, we’d be able to get back to “normal”? Well, clearly
we are still far from normal with no end in sight. Let’s take stock of where we are right now.</p>

<ol>
<li>After an initial spike in the northeast (especially New York City), we now see the south and southwestern parts of
the country with high caseloads and mortality.<br></li>
<li>Therapy has improved, especially with proning and steroid use in the ICU. This has brought the death rate down.<br></li>
<li>There are over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html" target="_blank">130 vaccines</a>
currently being developed, mostly against the spike protein. This protein is the key for entrance into the cells via binding to the ACE2 receptor, but it is still not proven to be the best immunologic target for vaccines (fingers crossed).<br></li>
<li>The US and other governments around the world have already spent billions of dollars on some of the leading
candidate vaccines prior to their full-testing.<br></li>
<li>All economies have been hit hard by the pandemic so far. Deficit spending and unemployment numbers are through the
roof while GDP estimates have taken a nose-dive.</li>
</ol>

<p>While this vaccine promises to be the fastest ever developed, I think that in the best-case scenario, we still have
about a year before widespread production and distribution. What are we supposed to do in the meantime?</p>

<p>The only reasonable way forward is through <strong>rapid and inexpensive daily testing</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it sounds kind of crazy, but there are many groups working on simple tests which could be done in schools and
workplaces. <a href="https://www.stopcovid.science/" target="_blank">This group at MIT</a> has caught my eye. The “STOPCovid” white
paper is worth a read, but in summary, they claim to have a working technique wherein a nasal swab or saliva sample is
a) lysed to release RNA, b) RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA with a special tag, and finally c) the sample
is read visually like a pregnancy test. Sensitivity and specificity in intial tests are incredble at 97% and 100%
respectively. Finally, this test can be performed in about an hour and the group claims a preliminary cost of only
<strong>$10 USD per test</strong>.</p>

<p>If this or other rapid tests can be deployed and used daily (or at the very least every few days) on our entire
population, we can stop the spread of this insidious infection and open our economies again. Kids can go back to
school. Restaurants can increase customer volume. Elderly family members can safely reunite with their children
and grandchildren.</p>

<p><strong>The only way we can responsibly relax our restrictive social distancing policies is
with rapid and constant testing.</strong> I see no other way to proceed as we wait on a vaccine.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I am planning to create a series of blog posts that includes some literature research, implementation of various data structures and our journey of creating a distributed datastore in <a href="https://distrentic.io/">distrentic.io</a>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why I start with a blog post explaining the Bloom Filter while I don’t have single clue about how to create a distributed datastore? My answer is simple: “I like the idea behind it”.</p>

<hr>

<p>Before I get into the details of the Bloom filters, I want to give our backstory that will help you understand <strong>why we started building something we’d enjoy during our spare time that will never be production ready</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="the-backstory">The backstory</h4>

<p>My friend Ibrahim and I are always fascinated by complex software and distibuted systems - We’ve been working together more than 5 years (we got old dude) and we were  lucky enough to work for the largest e-commerce company in Europe. We battled our way solving many different problems that distributed systems can offer. We both moved to Cambridge, UK and still fighting against distributed world villains.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let’s explore the mystic land of probabilistic data structures by implementing a Bloom Filter.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-hell-is-a-bloom-filter">What the hell is a Bloom Filter</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might also want to read <a href="https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html">Bloom filters debunked</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Bloom filter is a method for representing a set $A = {a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n}$ of n elements (also called keys) to support membership queries. It was invented by <strong>Burton Bloom</strong> in 1970 and was proposed for use in the web context by Marais and Bharat as a mechanism for identifying which pages have associated comments stored within a <em>CommonKnowledge</em> server. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to answer a very simple question: <strong>is this element a member of a set?</strong>. A Bloom filter does not store the actual elements, it only stores the <strong>membership</strong> of them.</p>

<p>False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not – in other words, a query returns either “possibly in set” or “definitely not in set”. <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately, this also means <strong>items cannot be removed from the Bloom Filter</strong> (Some other element or group of elements may be hashed to the same indices).</p>

<p>Because of its nature of being probabilistic, the Bloom Filter trades space and performance for accuracy. This is much like the CAP theorem, we choose performance over accuracy.</p>

<p>Bloom filters have some interesting use cases. For example, they can be placed on top of a datastore. When a key is queried for its existence and the filter does not have it, we can skip querying the datastore entirely.</p>

<p><img src="https://onatm.dev/assets/images/bloom_filter_example.png" alt="Example usage of a Bloom filter">
Figure 1: Example usage of a Bloom filter.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3>

<p>The idea behind Bloom filter is very simple: Allocate an array $v$ of $m$ bits, each bit in the array is initially set to $0$, and then choose $k$ independent hash functions $h_1, h_2, …, h_k$, each with range ${1,…,m}$.</p>

<p>The Bloom filter has two operations just like a standard set:</p>

<h4 id="insertion">Insertion</h4>

<p>When an element $a \in A$ is added to the filter, the bits at positions $h_1(a), h_2(a), …, h_k(a)$ in $v$ are set to $1$. In simpler words, the new element is hashed by $k$ number of functions and modded by $m$, resulting in $k$ indices into the bit array. Each bit at the respective index is set.</p>

<p><img src="https://onatm.dev/assets/images/bloom_filter_add.png" alt="Adding elements to a Bloom filter">
Figure 2: Adding elements to a Bloom filter ($m = 10$, $k = 3$).</p>

<h4 id="query">Query</h4>

<p>To query the membership of an element $b$, we check the bits at indices $h_1(b), h_2(b), …, h_k(b)$ in $v$. If any of them is $0$, then certainly $b$ is not in the set $A$. Otherwise, we assume that $b$ is in the set although it’s possible that some other element or group of elements hashed to the same indices. This is called a <strong>false positive</strong>. We can target a specific probability of false positives by selecting an optimal value of $m$ and $k$ for up to $n$ insertions.</p>

<hr>

<p>A Bloom filter eventually reaches a point where all bits are set, which means every query will indicate membership, effectively making the probability of false positives $1$. The problem with this is it requires a priori knowledge of the data set in order to select optimal parameters and avoid “overfilling”. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="finding-optimal-k-and-m">Finding optimal $k$ and $m$</h3>

<p>We can derive optimal $k$ and $m$ based on $n$ and a chosen probability of false positives $P_{FP}$.</p><p>

\[k = -\frac{\ln{P_{FP}}}{\ln{2}}
,
m = -\frac{n\ln{P_{FP}}}{(\ln2)^2}\]

</p><p>If you want to learn about how the above formulae are derived, you might want to pay a visit <a href="https://sagi.io/bloom-filters-for-the-perplexed/#appendix">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rust-implementation">Rust implementation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can find the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/distrentic/plum">here</a>.
Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/xfix">@xfix</a> for <a href="https://github.com/distrentic/plum/pull/1">fixing <code>hashers</code> initialization with the same seed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dkales">@dkales</a> for spotting <a href="https://github.com/distrentic/plum/issues/2">an issue with the ordering of operations in index calculation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally! It is time to write some <code>rust</code> <img title=":heart_eyes:" alt=":heart_eyes:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60d.png" height="20" width="20">. I am simultaneously implementing the bloom filter whilst writing this blog post. If you don’t believe me then check the below command:</p>



<p>Let’s continue with the dependencies. There is only one dependency and we will use it to create $v$.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>bit-vec</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will declare a new <code>struct</code> <code>StandardBloomFilter</code> to encapsulate required fields $k$ (optimal number of hash functions), $m$ (optimal size of the bit array), $v$ (the bit array), hash functions and a marker to tell rust compiler that our <code>struct</code> “owns” a <code>T</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extern</span> <span>crate</span> <span>bit_vec</span><span>;</span>

<span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>collections</span><span>::</span><span>hash_map</span><span>::{</span><span>DefaultHasher</span><span>,</span> <span>RandomState</span><span>};</span>

<span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>StandardBloomFilter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>bitmap</span><span>:</span> <span>BitVec</span><span>,</span>
    <span>optimal_m</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>optimal_k</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>hashers</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>DefaultHasher</span><span>;</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Careful readers will think that I made a mistake in the declaration of <code>hashers</code> array because of the requirement of $k$ independent hash functions. It was indeed intentional here’s why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why two hash functions?</strong> Kirsch and Mitzenmacher demonstrated in their paper that using two hash functions $h_1(x)$ and $h_2(x)$ to simulate additional hash functions of the form $g_i(x) = h_1(x) + {i}{h_2(x)}$ can be usefully applied to Bloom filters. This leads to less computation and potentially less need for randomness in practice. <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> This formula may appear similar to the use of pairwise indenpendent hash functions. Unfortunately, there is no formal connection between the two techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the Bloom Filter has two operations like a standard set: insert and query. We will implement those two operations along with constructor-like <code>new</code> method.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>StandardBloomFilter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>items_count</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span> <span>fp_rate</span><span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// ...snip</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>new</code> calculates the size of the <code>bitmap</code> ($v$) and <code>optimal_k</code> ($k$) and then instantiates a <code>StandardBloomFilter</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s run these calculations on <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=f83331e5f3fa5be8ec52545d03afa00f">Rust Playground</a>.</p>

<p>This looks really promising! A Bloom Filter that represents a set of $1$ million items with a false-positive rate of $0.01$ requires only $9585059$ bits ($~1.14\mathrm{MB}$)  and 7 hash functions.</p>

<p>We managed to construct a Bloom Filter so far and it is time to implement <code>insert</code> and <code>contains</code> methods. Their implementations are dead simple and they share the same code to calculate indexes of the bit array.</p>

<p>The above methods depend on two other methods that we haven’t implemented yet: <code>hash_kernel</code> and <code>get_index</code>. <code>hash_kernel</code> is going to be the one where the actual “hashing” happens. It will return the hash values of $h_1(x)$ and $h_2(x)$.</p>

<p>We could’ve used $128$ bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash3">MurmurHash3</a> and returned upper $64$ bit as <code>hash1</code> and the lower as <code>hash2</code> but to keep this implementation even simpler (this is how <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/hash/BloomFilterStrategies.java">Google Guava Bloom Filter implementation</a> currently works) and not to rely on any other additional dependencies I decided to continue with <code>DefaultHasher</code> - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">SipHash</a></p>

<p>Now, it is time to make the final touch. We are going to implement <code>get_index</code> by using $g_i(x) = h_1(x) + {i}{h_2(x)}$ to simulate more than two hash functions.</p>

<p><em><u>Last Update</u>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">2020-08-09</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?” And after a week or so, “What important problems are you working on?” And after some more time, I came in one day and said, “If what you are doing is not important, and if you don’t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you (at Bell Labs) working on it?” I wasn’t welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! — Richard Hamming, You and your research</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What grand challenges do we need to solve to push robotics (and AI) forward? When I thought hard about this question, I realized that I didn’t have a good answer. I’m actually not sure why I never asked myself this question before. Perhaps I’d converged to the “stationary distribution” of traversing only “relevant” research questions. Or maybe it’s a function of the sheer diversity in the different fields of inquiry that robotics supports. This coupled with the fast pace of the field makes it hard to identify key challenges and track progress. Nonetheless, I believe this is an important question to reflect on, not just for personal gratification, but more importantly, to understand how research contributions in one field can ripple across the space of research and affect questions in another field.</p>

<p>I expect this to be a living (and evolving) document as I distill information to reach a clearer understanding. For now, I’m bootstrapping most of the content from [1] and also using the paper as a scaffolding for organization. However, I expect the structure and content of this post to evolve as I read, synthesize, and figure out potentially better ways to organize the information.</p>

<p>While providing links to references + further reading, I’ve made the conscious decision of linking to sources with a high “fan-out”, to enable an easy launching point to read about further research.</p>

<p>I’d <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaprayan">appreciate suggestions</a> on content to add, general feedback, and comments!</p>

<p><em>Goal:</em> the seamless control of peripheral neuroprostheses, functional electric stimulation devices, and exoskeletons.</p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>sensing and data acquisition because current modalities are expensive and cumbersome</li>
<li>data processing and dealing with artifacts of non-cerebral origin (especially for wearable approaches)</li>
<li>cortex folding differs between individuals, as do relevant functional maps</li>
<li>sensor locations may differ across different recording sessions, and brain dynamics can be intrinsically non-stationary</li>
<li>current methods involve extended periods of training, calibration, learning, and adaptation, thus prohibitive for general use</li>
<li>unclear whether BCI will always outperform simpler techniques (such as eye-tracking or muscle-based devices)</li>
<li>dealing with tasks /w high degrees of freedom. current multiclass BCI classification generalizes poorly across individuals + tasks</li>

<h2 id="a-name-swarms-d-robot-swarms-a"><a name="swarms">[d] Robot swarms</a></h2>

<p><em>Goal:</em> to allow simpler, less expensive, modular units to be reconfigured into a team depending on the task that needs to be performed while being as effective as a larger, task-specific, monolithic robot.</p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>develop stochastic models for predicting collective behavior in large scale swarms (since interactions between individuals grow combinatorially)</p>

<ul>
<li>we lack models of flock/herd-like groups that elude enumeration in small scale groups yet do not justify ensemble-averaged models seen in large scale swarms</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>no systematic approach to designing multidimensional perception-action-communication feedback loops across large groups</p></li>

<li><p>lack of tools to create teams that can be responsive to human commands can adapt to changing conditions are robust to disturbances, resilient to adversarial, disruptive changes caused by large scale failures, or damage to swarm infrastructure.</p></li>

<h2 id="a-name-nav-and-exp-e-navigation-and-exploration-a"><a name="nav-and-exp">[e] Navigation and exploration</a></h2>

<p><em>Goal:</em> to navigate an explore extreme environments that are not only unmapped but also poorly understood, with abilities to adapt, to learn, and to recover and handle failures.</p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>operating in environments that are not only unmapped, but their very nature is not well understood:</p></li>

<li><p>tunnels or mines:</p>

<ul>
<li>rough terrain, narrow passages, degraded perception</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>nuclear decommissioning:</p>

<ul>
<li>radiation and restricted access</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>infrastructure construction:</p>

<ul>
<li>resist chemicals and materials used in the construction process</li>
<li>resist dirt, dust, and large impact forces</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>undersea robots</p>

<ul>
<li>radio does not penetrate. usual forms of communication + navigation disappear</li>
<li>untethered; hence must be autonomous</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>space robots</p>

<ul>
<li>long latency + low bandwidth reduces productivity and puts the survival of the robot at risk</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>how to learn, forget, and associate memories of scene content both qualitatively and semantically (similar to human perception)</p></li>

<li><p>surpass purely geometric maps to have a semantic understanding of scenes</p></li>

<li><p>evolve through online/lifelong learning</p></li>

<li><p>handle failures and learning to adapt + recover</p></li>

<li><p>develop abilities to make and recognize new discoveries</p></li>

</ul>

<p><em>The future:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>SLAM will go beyond current rigid + static assumptions, to effectively deal with time-varying, dynamic environments /w deformable objects</li>

<h2 id="a-name-materials-and-fab-f-new-materials-and-fabrication-schemes-a"><a name="materials-and-fab">[f] New materials and fabrication schemes</a></h2>

<p><em>Goal:</em> to develop a new generation of robots that are multifunctional, power-efficient, compliant, and autonomous in ways akin to biological organisms.</p>

<p>Examples include artificial muscles, compliant materials for soft robotics, and emerging advanced manufacturing and assembly strategies.</p>

<p><em>Challenges</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>improved portable energy storage and harvesting</li>
<li>designing new materials with tunable properties</li>
<li>fabrication and assembly is typically a serial process that is slow and difficult to scale to very large or very small scales.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The future:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>new fabrication strategies that embody these functional materials, including the robot building and repairing itself.</p></li>

<li><p>materials that integrate molecular machines [f1], or other force-generating molecules or biological motor proteins, into hierarchical materials.</p></li>

<li><p>the convergence of additive and subtractive methods, with emerging technologies involving 2D to 3D transformations to generate new architectures that can simplify the need for specialized hardware and enhance the robot’s function.</p></li>

<li><p>multiphoton lithography [f2] that can create features and structures over nine orders of magnitude in size.</p></li>

<li><p>materials that are able to adapt and heal over time</p></li>

		<p>The Random Forest algorithm from scikit-learn package can sometimes consume too much memory:</p>

</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html">Random Forest Classifier</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html">Random Forest Regressor</a> have default hyper-parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>max_depth=None</code>,</li>
  <li><code>min_samples_split=2</code>,</li>
  <li><code>min_samples_leaf=1</code>,</li>
</ul>

<p>which means that full trees are built. Bulding full trees is by design (see Leo Breiman, <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf">Random Forests</a> article from 2001). The Random Forest creates full trees to fit the data well. If there will be one tree in the Random Forest, then the model will overfit the data. However, in the Random Forest there are created set of trees (for example 100 trees). To overcome the overfitting (and increase stability) the bagging and random subspace sampling are used. (<strong>Bagging</strong> - selecting subset of rows for training, <strong>random subspace sampling</strong> - selecting subset of columns in each node split search).</p>

<p>In the case of large data sets or complex datasets, the full tree can be really deep and have thousands of nodes. 
Such single decision tree will use a lot of memory and thus the memory consumption of the Random Forest will grow very fast. In this post I will show how to reduce memory consumption of the Random Forest. In the example I will use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset">Adult Income dataset</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reduce-memory-usage-of-the-scikit-learn-random-forest">Reduce memory usage of the Scikit-Learn Random Forest</h2>

<p>The memory usage of the Random Forest depends on the size of a single tree and number of trees. The most straight forward way to reduce memory consumption will be to reduce the number of trees. For example <code>10</code> trees will use <code>10</code> times less memory than <code>100</code> trees. However, the more trees in the Random Forest the better for performance and I will search for other hyper-parameters to control the Random Forest size.</p>

<p>The simplest way to reduce the memory consumption is to limit the depth of the tree. Shallow trees will use less memory. Let’s train shallow Random Forest with <code>max_depth=6</code> (keep number of trees as default <code>100</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>shallow_rf</span> <span>=</span> <span>RandomForestClassifier</span><span>(</span><span>max_depth</span><span>=</span><span>6</span><span>)</span>
<span>shallow_rf</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s save the shallow Decision Tree to the disk:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>joblib</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>shallow_rf</span><span>.</span><span>estimators_</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>"first_tree_from_shallow_RF.joblib"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Single tree size from shallow RF: {np.round(os.path.getsize('first_tree_from_shallow_RF.joblib') / 1024 / 1024, 2) } MB"</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Single</span> <span>tree</span> <span>size</span> <span>from</span> <span>shallow</span> <span>RF</span><span>:</span> <span>0.01</span> <span>MB</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You see, the full single tree size was: <code>0.52</code> MB while the shallow tree size is <code>0.01</code> MB. Let’s save the whole forest:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>joblib</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>shallow_rf</span><span>,</span> <span>"Shallow_RandomForest_100_trees.joblib"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Shallow Random Forest size: {np.round(os.path.getsize('Shallow_RandomForest_100_trees.joblib') / 1024 / 1024, 2) } MB"</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Shallow</span> <span>Random</span> <span>Forest</span> <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>0.75</span> <span>MB</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Random Forest with full trees has size <code>49.67</code> MB and the shallow Random Forest size is <code>0.75</code> MB so <code>66</code> times less!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>49.67</span> <span>/</span> <span>0.75</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>66.22666666666667</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check the performance of such shallow tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>y_predicted</span> <span>=</span> <span>shallow_rf</span><span>.</span><span>predict_proba</span><span>(</span><span>X_test</span><span>)</span>
<span>shallow_rf_loss</span> <span>=</span> <span>log_loss</span><span>(</span><span>y_test</span><span>,</span> <span>y_predicted</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>shallow_rf_loss</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>0.33017571925200956</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The perfomance is better! The shallow Random Forest has about <code>4%</code> better logloss (the lower value the better). So we reduced the size of Random Forest by <code>66</code> times and increase the perfomance! :-)</p>

<p>The shallow trees can be also obtained by tuning <code>min_samples_split</code> or <code>min_samples_leaf</code> (or even other hyper-parameters, like: <code>min_weight_fraction_leaf</code>, <code>max_features</code>, <code>max_leaf_nodes</code>). However, I prefer to tune <code>max_depth</code> because it is more intuitive.</p>

<p>While saving the scikit-learn Random Forest with joblib you can use <code>compress</code> parameter to save the disk space. In the joblib <a href="https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.dump.html">docs</a> there is information that <code>compress=3</code> is a good compromise between size and speed.

<figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/thm-networks-banner.png"><figcaption><em>TryHackMe Networks</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>We're releasing networks, where you can deploy your own network in TryHackMe rooms and learn new concepts that were previously not possible with a single machine.</p><p>Networks in rooms have a visual network map, which updates as you discover or compromise machines on the network.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/v2-1.gif"><figcaption><em>Network map updating with newly discovered and compromised machines</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-networks-and-why-now">Why Networks, and Why Now?</h2><p>A lot of the content on TryHackMe focuses on stand alone virtual machines. This has been really great because it allows users to focus on particular techniques on individual components such as websites, network services and more. One down side of this is that it doesn't give the user a realistic experience of what to encounter in the real world; networks are used in almost every organisation and threats against networks can only be demonstrated and learnt through hands on experience. We've always focused on practical, real-world learning material and giving users' access to networks helps us fulfil this goal.</p><p>We have always taken an educational approach to teaching cyber security on TryHackMe - this is reflected by how rooms are structured. Our first network Throwback (more details later in the blog), simulate networks seen in the industry; we've added the complexity of a corporate network showing some very common attack paths. Instead of throwing users in the deep end and letting them figure how everything works, we're using a mixture of guided content and challenges to teach how networks can be vulnerable in many different ways.</p><p>Finally, we pride ourselves in being affordable. We've always worked on reducing barriers to entry for security, and one of these barriers is the cost. We want to provide high quality education that will be available for a reasonably low price! The first network we're releasing will be a paid course, the next network released will be for VIP Subscribers and then we will have networks freely available to everyone (<em>yes you read that right)</em>!</p><h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2><p>We've always built TryHackMe to be flexible and networks is no exception. Here are a few of our plans for the future:</p><ul><li>Allowing users to upload their own machines, and configure their own vulnerable networks they can use in rooms they've created; <em>we already do this for certain educational institutions as a bespoke service.</em></li><li>Releasing VIP Subscriber-only networks, followed by networks available for everyone (at no cost).</li><li>Integrating networks into <a href="https://tryhackme.com/games/koth">King of the Hill</a>, our competitive hacking game.</li><li>More courses with network integration and a CTF-like network</li></ul><h2 id="our-first-network-throwback">Our First Network - Throwback</h2><p>A staple of modern hacking training, our first network is being released the week of the 17th of August: <strong>Throwback Hacks</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/throwback.svg"><figcaption><em>Throwback Network Logo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Throwback is an Active Directory (AD) lab that teaches the fundamentals and core concepts of attacking a Windows network. The network simulates a realistic corporate environment that has several attack vectors you would expect to find in today’s organisations.</p><p>The lab uses a structured approach to guide users through exploiting the network, but requires you to put what you've learnt into practice, solving challenges as you go. The use of Windows to manage authentication and user identities in IT infrastructure today is so commonly used; as an aspiring security practitioner, it’s crucial to understand how this works and the network’s common weaknesses.</p><p>In this scenario, you’ll be assessing Throwback Hacks Security: a rather unfortunate security company that really doesn't practice much of what it preaches and subsequently has a network that is positively riddled with issues (and multiple paths for compromise). As our first network, this course will be targeted towards intermediate TryHackMe members as a separate package from our monthly subscription. Additionally, we'll have course material that accompanies the network which will cover the following topics (and more!):</p><ul><li>Phishing and OSINT (with user emulation!)</li><li>Lateral Movement</li><li>Kerberos Abuse </li><li> Malicious Macros</li><li>Active Directory Enumeration &amp; Exploitation</li><li>Attacking Mail Servers</li><li>Firewall Pivoting</li><li>Utilizing C2 </li><li>Abusing Cross-Domain Trusts</li></ul><p>Access to the network can be purchased so far in increments of either 30 or 45 days, albeit we're playing with these amounts a bit so they're subject to further change. Once available, you can find networks on the sidebar under networks (not shown until 15th August):</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/networks-link-location-highlighted.png"><figcaption><em>Networks location on the dashboard.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Once in this menu, you'll be presented with an overview of Throwback as well as the various purchasing options:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/package-selection-purchase-preview.png"><figcaption><em>Purchasing Options Preview</em></figcaption></figure><p>Throwback consists of eleven different machines, varying in difficulty and in purpose. Here's a quick preview of the layout within the control panel:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/network_layout.png"><figcaption><em>Throwback Hacks Network Control Panel Preview</em></figcaption></figure><p>Do note, to access this network you'll have to download a separate connection pack. You can select this from the access page per normal:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/vpn-pack-preview.png"><figcaption><em>VPN Selection via the Access Page</em></figcaption></figure><p>Once connected, you'll be able to explore and start hacking the network. See if you compromise every machine and find every path to pwn Throwback Hacks!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/breach-or-gtfo-header.png"><figcaption><em>One of the various services on the Throwback Hacks network</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're very fond of using the room like structure to provide access to content; users' don't just hack into virtual machines, but have access to supporting material to teach them various techniques. While progressing through room, users' also answer questions to ensure that they're on the right track and to reinforce their learning. We'll be applying the same approach to networks; you'll have plenty of material to guide you on what to do to provide an efficient and enjoyable learning experience. </p><p>The course will be $60 for 30 days of access (~£45); which works out to be $2 a day. </p><p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p><ul><li>Is this included with a subscription? <em>Unfortunately no, in this case we have networks available as a separate package. However, other networks will be available for both VIP and free users.</em></li><li>Is this a shared environment? <em>Yes, the networks will be shared between roughly five or so users. This allows us to keep costs significantly lower overall. </em></li><li>Are we allowed to do videos/stream the network? <em>Absolutely! You can stream/do videos over the network as much as you like, same as our other content. The only exceptions to this is that we ask you don't share the coursework.</em></li><li>Can we do write-ups on the network? <em>Yeah :) Just again, keep the coursework out of these. You can refer to specific sections of the coursework though! </em></li><li>Will you have more networks in the future? <em>Yup! We'll have one that's included with our normal subscription and eventually a free network. Of course these will vary in size from Throwback a fair bit.</em></li><li>Is there a certificate of completion? <em>Yes, once you've managed to compromise every machine on the network, you can download a certificate to prove your skills to others.</em></li></ul><p>As always, happy hacking! &lt;3</p>

		<p>tl;dr: Use advanced Google Search to find any webpage, emails, info, or secrets</p>
<p>cost: $0</p>
<p>time: 2 minutes</p>

<p>Software engineers have long joked about how much of their job is <a href="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/">simply Googling things</a>.</p>
<p>Now you can do the same, but for free.</p>
<p>Below, I'll cover <code>dorking</code>, the use of search engines to find very specific data:</p>
<p>For each example, you can paste it directly into Google to see the result.</p>
<h2>table of contents:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#webpages">webpages</a></li>
<li><a href="#emails">emails</a></li>
<li><a href="#files">files</a></li>
<li><a href="#seo">SEO</a></li>
<li><a href="#coupons">coupons!</a></li>
<li><a href="#secrets">secrets</a></li>
<li><a href="#review">operator review</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="webpages">webpages</h3>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/Contextify1/status/1255202725551202304">this Twitter exchange</a> with Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia, the next few examples will cover Gumroad and Sahil.</p>
<p>find specific pages within a website (ex: for DynamoDB e-books)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com dynamodb
</pre></div>


<p>find specific pages that must include a phrase in the Title text</p>
<div><pre><span></span>allintitle:"support this" site:gumroad.com
</pre></div>


<p>find similar sites (Google only)</p>



<p>you can chain operators together (ex: looking for bug bounties with either security or bug-bounty in the URL)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>(inurl:security OR inurl:bug-bounty OR site:hackerone.com) + "gumroad"
</pre></div>


<p>you can restrict to certain top-level domains (ex: lists of teachers)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:.edu filetype:xls inurl:"email.xls"
</pre></div>



<h3 id="emails">emails</h3>

<p>find Gmail accounts</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gmail.com"
</pre></div>


<p>find work accounts (you'll need to find their domain first)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gumroad.com"
</pre></div>


<p>not finding what you're looking for with either of those? Try to guess the  format of the email (try going to <a href="https://www.email-format.com/d/shopify.com/#">this site</a>, search the domain, and click <code>Identified Name Formats</code>))</p>



<p>you can always find every page with emails on it (and then use the next snippet below)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com intext:"@gumroad.com"
</pre></div>


<p>find every email on a web page that you're on. The big kahuna - this works for every website. Inject it into a site with Chrome DevTools (<a href="https://www.alec.fyi/how-to-scrape.html">more here</a>)</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>elems</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>"*"</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>re</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span><span>(</span><span>"(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>elems</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>re</span><span>.</span><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>elems</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>innerHTML</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>elems</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>innerHTML</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>this will log every email found, without you having to scan through the whole page.</p>

<h3 id="files">files</h3>

<p>find spreadsheets</p>
<div><pre><span></span>filetype:csv OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:xls OR filetype:xltx OR filetype:xlt OR inurl:airtable.com/universe/
</pre></div>


<p>find Google Docs and Google Sheets</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:docs.google.com "gumroad"
</pre></div>


<p>find where your competitor's logo is (ex: partners or customers' websites)</p>



<p>find your competitors' sales pitches and whitepapers</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:intercom.com (filetype:pdf OR filetype:ppt)
</pre></div>


<p>find case studies written about competitors</p>
<div><pre><span></span>inurl:hubspot-case-study -site:http://hubspot.com
</pre></div>



<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>

<p>find sites with specific keywords in the anchor text</p>
<div><pre><span></span>inanchor:"cyber security"
</pre></div>


<p>research blog posts with specific keywords in their title</p>



<p>find backlinks (ex: other sites that link to a particular blog post). note: the <code>link</code> operator is now deprecated</p>
<div><pre><span></span>intext:intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference
</pre></div>


<p>find keyword permutations with the <code>wildcard</code> operator</p>



<p>find companies using a given widget</p>
<div><pre><span></span>intext:"Powered by Intercom" -site:intercom.com
</pre></div>



<h3 id="coupons">coupons!</h3>

<p>search the site itself for codes</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:curology.com ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
</pre></div>


<p>next, try twitter</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:twitter.com + "meundies" + ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
</pre></div>


<p>next, try Mailchimp emails</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:campaign-archive.com + "blueapron" + ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
</pre></div>



<h3 id="secrets">secrets</h3>

<p>cybersecurity experts use dorking, as one tool among many, to find potential vulnerabilities in a company. I will not be covering any such queries, out of concern for their potential for misuse.</p>

<h3 id="review">operator review</h3>

<p><code>operators</code> are components of a search query that narrow the results down. You can combine as many as you want in one query. The most useful ones you'll want to know are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>operator</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"phrase"</td>
<td>results must include "phrase"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-phrase</td>
<td>exclude results with phrase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 AND phrase2 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>phrase1 and phrase2 must both be included</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 OR phrase2</td>
<td>one of phrase1 and phrase2 must be included (or both)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>site:example.com</td>
<td>results must be on domain example.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>filetype:jpg</td>
<td>results must be of type <code>.jpg</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>AND/OR logic can be used to combine distinct queries</p>
<div><pre><span></span>"phrase1" OR "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"
# equivalent to these two searches
&gt;&gt; "phrase1"
&gt;&gt; "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"
</pre></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm back! Sorry that I didn't blog for more than two weeks. I might have gotten a bit too much into the streaming world and programmed more than blogging about it. This post starts with some housekeeping and then explains the newest project I'm working on. Feel free to jump to the point you are most interested in.</p>

<h2 id="housekeeping"><a href="#housekeeping">Housekeeping</a></h2>
<p>The last post here was about visualizing kinda random numbers :D <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/visualizing-digits">Visualizing digits</a>. It might be the one that brought me to building Javis but more on that later.</p>
<p>I'm currently mostly working on two projects:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/ConstraintSolver.jl">ConstraintSolver.jl</a> where I try to build a constraint solver from scratch in Julia.  I started with some refactoring lately and streamed about it via <a href="https://twitch.tv/opensourcesblog">Twitch</a>. The videos are saved on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnUHCvJBCUggZUqBTAZb4w">YouTube</a>. The refactoring is still going and I probably will write a post about that once it's done just to have a better structure of the outcome. Streaming is unstructured and hard to watch later I suppose. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to combine my possibilities to teach julia. </p>
<p>The new project is <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis.jl</a> which I explain in the next section.</p>
<p>Sometimes I work on <a href="https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Juniper.jl">Juniper.jl</a> as it is my small baby. It's my first project in Julia and the most used one I've built up til now. I mostly do bugfixes for it at the moment but might come back to it to add some new awesome features.</p>
<h2 id="javisjl"><a href="#javisjl">Javis.jl</a></h2>
<p>Okay what is Javis?</p>
<p>Javis stands for <strong>J</strong>ulia M<strong>a</strong>thematical <strong>vis</strong>ualizations and animations. (Currently at least 😄)</p>
<p>A small side note maybe: The Juniper package I was talking about was called <code>MINLPBnB.jl</code> which is the worst name possible, so I might have gotten better at naming things. I have to say it's very easy to see what the package does: <strong>M</strong>ixed <strong>I</strong>teger <strong>N</strong>on-<strong>L</strong>inear <strong>P</strong>rogramming using <strong>Branch</strong> a<strong>n</strong>d <strong>B</strong>ound. Well, some folks told me it should have a proper name... We debated to call it <code>Bacon.jl</code> and I can't remember what it stands for.</p>
<p>... <a href="https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Juniper.jl/issues/55#issuecomment-346687286">The thread</a> apparently it was for "Branch Optimization Nonlinear".  Just saw that I suggested BOREDOM as well. Oh man fun times...</p>
<p>Any way I liked <code>Javis</code> this time and just tried to find out what it might stand for.</p>
<p><strong>To answer the actual question:</strong></p>
<p>Javis tries to make it as easy and extensible as possible to create small animations like this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/dancing_circles.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/dancing_circles.gif" alt="Dancing circles"></a></p><p>I'll show the code for it later. 😉  In general I want to have a simple way to animate all the ideas that might get into my head. Just some examples</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visualizing linear algebra concepts easily</p>
</li>
<li><p>Animate puzzles for my ConstraintSolver</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explore math concepts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants"><a href="#standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">Standing on the shoulders of giants</a></h3>
<p>Normally I try to build things from scratch (in a high level programming language 😄). This time I'm more aware than ever that I'm standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>It is of course built with <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> which should be no surprise. BTW a new version (v1.5) is official now 👍</p>
<p>Besides that it is highly dependent on the awesome package <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl">Luxor.jl</a> which is used for all the drawing onto a canvas.  It provides simple functions like <code>line</code>, <code>circle</code> and so on but also gave rise to the way we do animations.</p>
<p>Luxor.jl is itself built using <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Cairo.jl">Cairo.jl</a> which is a wrapper around the C library <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>. </p>
<p>If you're interested in 2D graphics, you should definitely check out the awesome <a href="https://juliagraphics.github.io/Luxor.jl/stable/tutorial/">Luxor Tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3 id="state_of_javis"><a href="#state_of_javis">State of Javis</a></h3>
<p>You might be interested in the current state of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis.jl</a> as the documentation is very sparse (or non-existent for <code>stable</code>) and the README doesn't show anything especially entertaining 😄</p>
<p>Me an my fellow Julian and streamer <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/">Jacob Zelko</a> started this project about two weeks ago. Furthermore, I was away for a week so everything is very new.</p>
<p>The basic functionality</p>
<ul>
<li><p>\(\LaTeX\) text which is not possible in Luxor.jl</p>
</li>
<li><p>Translation and rotation of objects</p>
</li>
<li><p>Objects depending on others (quite basic as of now)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Very basic morphing between two shapes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I give a view into the future you might want to see some code, right?</p>
<h3 id="how_to_do_the_animation_from_above"><a href="#how_to_do_the_animation_from_above">How to do the animation from above?</a></h3>
<p>I think we should start with the very very basics before I show you the 40 lines of code.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis, Luxor</code></pre>
<p>We normally need both of the packages as we want to do some animations (<code>Javis</code>) and want to do some drawing (<code>Luxor</code>).</p>
<p>I don't like to work in the global scope so let's create a function:</p>
<pre><code>function dancing()
    video = Video(500, 500)
    javis(video,
        [
         ...
        ]
    ,tempdirectory="test/current/images", deletetemp=true, creategif=true, pathname="test/current/dancing_circles.gif")
end</code></pre>
<p>It has quite a few parameters to create a simple <code>gif</code> out of it, so I think this needs improvement but that's for another day.</p>
<p>First of all we create our video object which is nothing more than a struct. The object sets the width and height in pixel of the video and stores information in between but that is of no concern to the user.</p>
<p>Then we have our <code>javis</code> function which is the main function of our project. It takes at least two arguments: the <code>video</code> and a list of actions that shall be performed during the video. The <code>...</code> is just a placeholder for now. </p>
<p>We have a list of keyword arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>tempdirectory</code> stores the images (yes we create an image for each frame and combine them later)</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>deletetemp</code> means that all images are destroyed after we created the gif</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>creategif</code> yes we want to create a gif and not only having a list of images</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>pathname</code> the gif should be stored here</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay now to <code>Action</code>.</p>
<p>Let's create our first "Animation":</p>
<pre><code>function ground(args...) 
    background("white")
    sethue("black")
end

function dancing()
    video = Video(500, 500)
    javis(video,
        [
         BackgroundAction(1:70, ground)
        ]
    ,tempdirectory="test/current/images", deletetemp=true, creategif=true, pathname="test/current/dancing_circles.gif")
end</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ground</code> function sets the background to white and the paint brush color to black. </p>
<p><strong>Why do I need the <code>args...</code>?</strong> I'm glad you ask. Each user function gets three arguments <code>video, action, frame</code> where the first is the <code>Video</code> struct, the second is the <code>Action</code> struct and <code>frame</code> is just the current frame number. They are irrelevant for the background such that we don't need to write them down explicitly.  "Unfortunately" we need to write <code>args...</code> such that Julia actually knows that we have a method that accepts those three arguments. The <code>...</code> basically stands for as many arguments as you want.</p>
<div><p>⚠ Note</p>
<p><code>sethue</code> is the same as <code>setcolor</code> but doesn't mess with the opacity</p></div>
<p>More interesting is the <code>BackgroundAction(1:70, ground)</code> which has just two arguments here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>frames</code> a range of frames it is applied to. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>func</code> the function that is called for each frame</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope it is clear what you can expect from the 70 frames we just created 😉 </p><details><summary> Feel free to click to see the boringness</summary> <a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/test.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/test.gif" alt="Test"></a></details>
<p>Okay it's time to actually draw something with adding another action:</p>
<pre><code>...
    BackgroundAction(1:70, ground),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;line(O, Point(25, 25), :stroke), Translation(O, Point(0, 100)))
...</code></pre>
<p>This time we define an <code>Action</code> instead of a <code>BackgroundAction</code> which basically means: Everything in this action stays in the action and is not exposed to the outside world. You might wanna call it the Vegas of actions. Sorry for the bad joke...</p>
<p>There are some new parts in this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An anonymous function with the <code>-&gt;</code> syntax. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>line</code> function from Luxor which takes in two points and an action</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>O</code> is the same as <code>Point(0, 0)</code> and stands for origin (which is in the center of the canvas)</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>:stroke</code> means that we want to actually draw the line which is <strong>not</strong> the default and might be confusing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code>Translation</code> from the origin to the point <code>(0,100)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more information before you have a look at the spoiler.</p>
<p>The canvas has its origin in the center as mentioned but it also has the y-axis going down instead of up. I'm not sure whether we want to change that for Javis.</p>
<details><summary> Did you expect this?</summary> <a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/line.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/line.gif" alt="Falling line"></a></details>
<p>So the <code>Translation</code> is animated by interpolation between the start and end translation. In the future we will make it possible to use easing functions to change this behavior. </p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>Translation</code> translates the plane such that drawing the line from <code>(0,0)</code> to <code>(25, 25)</code> results in drawing it from <code>(0, 100)</code> to <code>(25, 125)</code> in the last frame.</p>
<p>I hope that it makes sense so far. </p>
<p>Okay how do I draw circle that is moving down at the same rate by defining a new <code>Action</code>?</p>
<pre><code>...
    BackgroundAction(1:70, ground),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;line(O, Point(25, 25), :stroke), Translation(O, Point(0, 100))),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;circle(Point(-25, 0), 10, :fill), Translation(O, Point(0, 100)))
...</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right?</p>
<p>Okay this is the boring way of doing it but let's have a look at the <code>circle</code> function first. </p>
<p>The <code>circle</code> function takes a <code>Point</code> a <code>radius</code> and an action. For the action I chose <code>:fill</code> instead of <code>:stroke</code> this time.</p>
<p>For a bit more fun we want to define the first action a bit differently using a named function.</p>
<pre><code>function draw_line(args...)
    line(O, Point(25, 25), :stroke)
    return Transformation(O, 0.0)
end</code></pre>
<p>and then:</p>
<pre><code>...
    BackgroundAction(1:70, ground),
    Action(1:70, :line, draw_line, Translation(O, Point(0, 100))),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;circle(pos(:line) .+ Point(-25, 0), 10, :fill))
...</code></pre>
<p>This adds quite some more complexity but hopefully it's not too hard to understand and it is a very powerful tool.</p>
<pre><code>Action(1:70, :line, draw_line, Translation(O, Point(0, 100))),</code></pre>
<p>is not an anonymous function anymore but it also has a name <code>:line</code> as the second argument.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the function now return something:</p>
<pre><code>return Transformation(O, 0.0)</code></pre>
<p>It does return the same position (the origin, tail of the line) every time. The second argument is the <code>angle</code> of the transformation which is set to <code>0.0</code> as we don't use it. There is already a PR to be able to use <code>return O</code> instead 😉</p>
<div><p>Edit:  07.08</p>
<p>The PR got merged such that you can write <code>return Point(x,y)</code> now instead of using a <code>Transformation</code>.</p></div>
<p>Now in the <code>circle</code> action:</p>
<pre><code>Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;circle(pos(:line) .+ Point(-25, 0), 10, :fill))</code></pre>
<p>we have access to the position of the line with <code>pos(:line)</code> and we removed the <code>Translation</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>pos(:line)</code> is actually not the origin all the time as it had its own <code>Translation</code>. Javis "assumes" that you're interested in the actual …</p></div></div>

They found that cepafungin I bound to not one but two places on the proteasome, enacting a powerful result. Their report appears in the journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-chemical-biology%2Ffulltext%2FS2451-9456%2820%2930285-3%3F_returnURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%252Fretrieve%252Fpii%252FS2451945620302853%253Fshowall%253Dtrue&amp;t=NjY3MDg2ZTIyMzhmMGJhODJhMmM4MTZlODQ1MDg2ZjlmYjA2MmJkZCxSOHk5NUxheg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625997758414929920%2Fsynthesizing-cepafungin&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597162861"><i>Cell Chemical Biology</i></a>.</p><p>“Because cepafungin I is able to engage the proteasome in two ways, it allows for amplification of its effect,” Renata says. “We showed that this compound elicits many similar downstream biological responses as the FDA-approved chemotherapy bortezomib, while also having certain qualities that may translate into fewer unwanted side effects for patients.”</p><h2><b>Recreating nature</b></h2><p>Cepafungin I first intrigued researchers because of its usefulness as an antifungal substance, and later as a promising anti-cancer agent. It kills cells by acting on the proteasome, which is responsible for clearing away the “garbage” produced by cells. When the proteasome’s function is blocked, cells are overcome with their waste and die.</p><p>But making enough of the compound to be able to study its activity or enable its eventual use a medication has proven challenging, due largely to its complex molecular structure. In the field of chemistry, scientists seek to create the desired structure in as few steps as possible, which leads to cost and time savings. But with complex compounds, that isn’t an easy task. &nbsp;</p><p>The Scripps Research team was able to overcome these challenges and synthesize the compound in just nine steps. For comparison, a related compound known as glidobactin A was synthesized in 21 steps in 1992—and that was considered a landmark at the time.</p><p>The team was able to speed up the process by using certain enzymes that enabled construction of one of the compound’s key building blocks, an amino acid. Then they developed other creative chemistry methods to simplify construction of other parts of the molecule, including a branched lipid portion that was subsequently found to contribute to the compound’s potent activity.</p><p>“Our approach saved us many steps in synthesizing the final compound compared with using classical chemical approaches,” says Alexander Amatuni, a graduate student at Scripps Research and an author of the study.</p><h2><b>A good sign for safety</b></h2><p>After creating the compound, the chemists discovered that in addition to being exceptionally selective at targeting two sites on the proteasome, it didn’t show any undesired cross-reaction with other proteins in cells, a feature that could make it a better drug candidate.</p><p>Three proteasome inhibitors—bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib—have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. “But those medications have some potentially serious side effects, and cancer cells may develop resistance to them over time,” says co-author Adibekian, associate professor of chemistry at Scripps Research. “There is a need for alternative, more specific proteasome inhibitors.”</p><p>Graduate student Anton Shuster, also an author of the new research, noted that the team’s discoveries were made possible by a close collaboration of labs with different expertise</p><p>“By combining the two complementary technological platforms—chemoenzymatic synthesis from the Renata lab and chemoproteomics from the Adibekian lab—we were able to succeed,” Shuster says. “Having the opportunity to work with scientists with divergent research background is what makes working at Scripps Research particularly exciting.”</p><p>Going forward, the scientists plan to continue structure-guided design of similar molecules with alternative structural features in search of useful compounds with superior anti-cancer activity.</p><p>The methods they developed will enable them to change various parts of the structure with relative ease, Amatuni says, allowing for further investigation of biological activity. “The emphasis on translational research at Scripps Research enables this discovery,” Adibekian says. “We’re excited about developing the molecule further.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scripps.edu%2Fnews-and-events%2Fpress-room%2F2020%2F20200806-renata-adibekian-cepafungin.html&amp;t=MmQ4NWM5MjJlYzY2N2E2MTExM2Q2YzRiMjE1NzVlYTZkNDE3MWYzZSxSOHk5NUxheg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625997758414929920%2Fsynthesizing-cepafungin&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597162861">Scripps Research Institute</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b> “Concise Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis and Identification of Cellular Targets of Cepafungin I”, <i>Cell Chemical Biology</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.chembiol.2020.07.012&amp;t=Mzc4Y2M1NThhZDczZTlmZjUyOTUyNjc2NGY4MjljZDIwMjEzZWI3OCxSOHk5NUxheg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625997758414929920%2Fsynthesizing-cepafungin&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597162861">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.07.012</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/190367274522/non-oncology-drugs-killing-cancer-cells">A number of non-oncology drugs could potentially kill cancer cells</a></p>

<p>We spent the whole <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">Chapter 2</a> defining what we will be building (an email newsletter!), narrowing down a precise set of requirements. It is now time to roll up our sleeves and get started with it.</p>

<p>This chapter will take a first stab at implementing this user story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger an API call to a backend server that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.<br>
This chapter will focus on that backend server - we will implement the <code>/subscribe</code> POST endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="1-1-our-strategy">1.1. Our Strategy</h2>

<p>We are starting a new project from scratch - there is a fair amount of upfront heavy-lifting we need to take care of:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a web framework and get familiar with it;<br></li>
<li>define our testing strategy;<br></li>
<li>choose a crate to interact with our database (we will have to save those emails somewhere!);<br></li>
<li>define how we want to manage changes to our database schemas over time (a.k.a. migrations);<br></li>
<li>actually write some queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot and jumping in head-first might be overwhelming.<br>
We will add a stepping stone to make the journey more approachable: before tackling <code>/subscribe</code> we will implement a <code>/health_check</code> endpoint. No business logic, but a good opportunity to become friends with our web framework and get an understanding of all its different moving parts.</p>

<p>We will be relying on our Continuous Integration pipeline to keep us in check throughout the process - if you have not set it up yet, have a quick look at <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/">Chapter 1</a> (or grab one of the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/#5-2-ready-to-go-ci-pipelines">ready-made templates</a>).</p>



<p>What web framework should we use to write our Rust API?<br>
This was supposed to be a section on the pros and cons of the Rust web frameworks currently available. It eventually grew to be so long that it did not make sense to embed it here and I published it as a spin-off article: check out <em><a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">Choosing a Rust web framework, 2020 edition</a></em> for a deep-dive on <code>actix-web</code>, <code>rocket</code>, <code>tide</code> and <code>warp</code>.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR:</em> as of August 2020, <code>actix-web</code> should be your go-to web framework when it comes to Rust APIs aimed for production usage - it has seen extensive usage in the past couple of years, it has a large and healthy community behind it and it runs on <code>tokio</code>, therefore minimising the likelihood of having to deal with incompatibilities/interop between different async runtimes.<br>
It will thus be our choice for Zero To Production.</p>

<p>Nonetheless <code>tide</code>, <code>rocket</code> and <code>warp</code> have huge potential and we might end up making a different decision in 2021 - if you are following along Zero To Production using a different framework I’d be delighted to have a look at your code! Please shoot me an email at <em>contact@lpalmieri.com</em></p>

<p>Throughout this chapter and beyond I suggest you to keep a couple of extra browser tabs open: <a href="https://actix.rs/"><code>actix-web</code>’s website</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/"><code>actix-web</code>’s documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/actix/examples"><code>actix-web</code>’s examples collection</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s try to get off the ground by implementing a health-check endpoint: when we receive a <code>GET</code> request for <code>/health_check</code> we want to return a <code>200 OK</code> response with no body.</p>

<p>We can use <code>/health_check</code> to verify that the application is up and ready to accept incoming requests.<br>
Combine it with a SaaS service like <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">pingdom.com</a> and you can be <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/alerting/#">alerted</a> when your API goes dark - quite a good baseline for an email newsletter that you are running on the side.</p>

<p>A health-check endpoint can also be handy if you are using a container orchestrator to juggle your application (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command">Kubernetes</a> or <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service#service-parameters">Nomad</a>): the orchestrator can call <code>/health_check</code> to detect if the API has become unresponsive and trigger a restart.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-1-server-httpserver">3.2.1. Server - <code>HttpServer</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.HttpServer.html"><code>HttpServer</code></a> is the backbone supporting our application. It takes care of things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>where should the application be listening for incoming requests? A TCP socket (e.g. <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code>)? A Unix domain socket?<br></li>
<li>what is the maximum number of concurrent connections that we should allow? How many new connections per unit of time?<br></li>
<li>should we enable transport level security (TLS)?<br></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>HttpServer</code>, in other words, handles all <em>transport level</em> concerns.<br>
What happens afterwards? What does <code>HttpServer</code> do when it has established a new connection with a client of our API and we need to start handling their requests?<br>
That is where <code>App</code> comes into play!</p>

<h3 id="3-2-2-application-app">3.2.2. Application - <code>App</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html"><code>App</code></a> is where all your application logic lives: routing, middlewares, request handlers, etc.<br>
<code>App</code> is the component whose job is to take an incoming request as input and spit out a response.<br>
Let’s zoom in on our code snippet:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>

    .<span>route</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
    .<span>route</span>(<span>"/{name}"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>App</code> is a practical example of the <em>builder pattern</em>: <code>new()</code> gives us a clean slate to which we can add, one bit at a time, new behaviour using a fluent API (i.e. chaining method calls one after the other).<br>
We will cover the majority of <code>App</code>’s API surface on a need-to-know basis over the course of the whole book: by the end of our journey you should have touched most of its methods at least once.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-3-endpoint-route">3.2.3. Endpoint - <code>Route</code></h3>

<p>How do we add a new endpoint to our <code>App</code>?<br>
The <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html#method.route"><code>route</code></a> method is probably the simplest way to go about doing it - it is used in an <em>Hello World!</em> example after all!</p>

<p><code>route</code> takes two parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>path</code>, a string, possibly templated (e.g. <code>"/{name}"</code>) to accommodate dynamic path segments;<br></li>
<li><code>route</code>, an instance of the <code>Route</code> struct.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.Route.html"><code>Route</code></a> combines a <em>handler</em> with a set of <em>guards</em>.<br>
Guards specify conditions that a request must satisfy in order to “match” and be passed over to the handler. From an implementation standpoint guards are implementors of the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/guard/trait.Guard.html"><code>Guard</code></a> trait: <code>Guard::check</code> is where the magic happens.</p>

<p>In our snippet we have</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust">.<span>route</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>"/"</code> will match all requests without any segment following the base path - i.e. <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>.<br>
<code>web::get()</code> is a short-cut for <code>Route::new().guard(guard::Get())</code> a.k.a. the request should be passed to the handler if and only if its HTTP method is <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>You can start to picture what happens when a new request comes in: <code>App</code> iterates over all registered endpoints until it finds a matching one (both path template and guards are satisfied) and passes over the request object to the handler.<br>
This is not 100% accurate but it is a good enough mental model for the time being.</p>

<p>What does a handler look like instead? What is its function signature?<br>
We only have one example at the moment, <code>greet</code>:</p>

}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>greet</code> is an asynchronous function that takes a <code>HttpRequest</code> as input and returns <em>~something~</em> that implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/trait.Responder.html"><code>Responder</code></a> trait<sup id="fnref:impl-trait-syntax"><a href="#fn:impl-trait-syntax">3</a></sup>.<br>
A type implements the <code>Responder</code> trait if it can be converted (asynchronously) into a <code>HttpResponse</code> - it is implemented off the shelf for a variety of common types (e.g. strings, status codes, bytes, <code>Http…</code></p></div></div>

<h3>3.1 Second Normal Form </h3>

<p>Second normal form is violated when a non-key field is a fact about a subset of a key.
It is only relevant when the key is composite, i.e., consists of several fields. Consider
the following inventory record: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>---------------------------------------------------
| PART | WAREHOUSE | QUANTITY | WAREHOUSE-ADDRESS |
====================-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The key here consists of the PART and WAREHOUSE fields together, but WAREHOUSE-ADDRESS
is a fact about the WAREHOUSE alone. The basic problems with this design are: 

</p><ul>
  <li>The warehouse address is repeated in every record that refers to a part stored in that
    warehouse. </li>
  <li>If the address of the warehouse changes, every record referring to a part stored in that
    warehouse must be updated. </li>
  <li>Because of the redundancy, the data might become inconsistent, with different records
    showing different addresses for the same warehouse. </li>
  <li>If at some point in time there are no parts stored in the warehouse, there may be no
    record in which to keep the warehouse's address. </li>
</ul>

<p>To satisfy second normal form, the record shown above should be decomposed into
(replaced by) the two records: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------  --------------------------------- 
| PART | WAREHOUSE | QUANTITY |  | WAREHOUSE | WAREHOUSE-ADDRESS |
====================-----------  =============--------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When a data design is changed in this way, replacing unnormalized records with
normalized records, the process is referred to as normalization. The term
"normalization" is sometimes used relative to a particular normal form. Thus a
set of records may be normalized with respect to second normal form but not with respect
to third. </p>

</div><div name="label3.3">

<h3>3.3 Functional Dependencies </h3>

<p>In relational database theory, second and third normal forms are defined in terms of
functional dependencies, which correspond approximately to our single-valued facts. A
field Y is "functionally dependent" on a field (or fields) X if it is invalid to
have two records with the same X-value but different Y-values. That is, a given X-value
must always occur with the same Y-value. When X is a key, then all fields are by
definition functionally dependent on X in a trivial way, since there can't be two records
having the same X value. </p>

<p>There is a slight technical difference between functional dependencies and
single-valued facts as we have presented them. Functional dependencies only exist when the
things involved have unique and singular identifiers (representations). For example,
suppose a person's address is a single-valued fact, i.e., a person has only one address.
If we don't provide unique identifiers for people, then there will not be a functional
dependency in the data: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>----------------------------------------------
|   PERSON   |       ADDRESS                 |
-------------+--------------------------------
| John Smith | 123 Main St., New York        |
| John Smith | 321 Center St., San Francisco |
----------------------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Although each person has a unique address, a given name can appear with several
different addresses. Hence we do not have a functional dependency corresponding to our
single-valued fact. </p>

<p>Similarly, the address has to be spelled identically in each occurrence in order to
have a functional dependency. In the following case the same person appears to be living
at two different addresses, again precluding a functional dependency. </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>---------------------------------------
|   PERSON   |       ADDRESS          |
-------------+-------------------------
| John Smith | 123 Main St., New York |
| John Smith | 123 Main Street, NYC   |
---------------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>We are not defending the use of non-unique or non-singular representations. Such
practices often lead to data maintenance problems of their own. We do wish to point out,
however, that functional dependencies and the various normal forms are really only defined
for situations in which there are unique and singular identifiers. Thus the design
guidelines as we present them are a bit stronger than those implied by the formal
definitions of the normal forms. </p>

<p>For instance, we as designers know that in the following example there is a
single-valued fact about a non-key field, and hence the design is susceptible to all the
update anomalies mentioned earlier. </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>----------------------------------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE  |  FATHER    |  FATHER'S-ADDRESS             |
|============------------+-------------------------------|
| Art Smith | John Smith | 123 Main St., New York        |
| Bob Smith | John Smith | 123 Main Street, NYC          |
| Cal Smith | John Smith | 321 Center St., San Francisco |
----------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

</div><div name="label4.1">

<h3>4.1 Fourth Normal Form </h3>

<p>Under fourth normal form, a record type should not contain two or more independent
multi-valued facts about an entity. In addition, the record must satisfy third normal
form. </p>

<p>The term "independent" will be discussed after considering an example. </p>

<p>Consider employees, skills, and languages, where an employee may have several skills
and several languages. We have here two many-to-many relationships, one between employees
and skills, and one between employees and languages. Under fourth normal form, these two
relationships should not be represented in a single record such as </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
===============================
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, they should be represented in the two records </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>--------------------  -----------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL |  | EMPLOYEE | LANGUAGE |
====================  =======================
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that other fields, not involving multi-valued facts, are permitted to occur in the
record, as in the case of the QUANTITY field in the earlier PART/WAREHOUSE example. </p>

<p>The main problem with violating fourth normal form is that it leads to uncertainties in
the maintenance policies. Several policies are possible for maintaining two independent
multi-valued facts in one record: </p>

<p>(1) A disjoint format, in which a record contains either a skill or a language, but not
both: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  |          |   
| Smith    | type  |          |
| Smith    |       | French   |
| Smith    |       | German   |
| Smith    |       | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not much different from maintaining two separate record types. (We note in
passing that such a format also leads to ambiguities regarding the meanings of blank
fields. A blank SKILL could mean the person has no skill, or the field is not applicable
to this employee, or the data is unknown, or, as in this case, the data may be found in
another record.) </p>

<p>(2) A random mix, with three variations: </p>

<p>(a) Minimal number of records, with repetitions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |   
| Smith    | type  | German   |
| Smith    | type  | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) Minimal number of records, with null values: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |   
| Smith    | type  | German   |
| Smith    |       | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) Unrestricted: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |   
| Smith    | type  |          |
| Smith    |       | German   |
| Smith    | type  | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) A "cross-product" form, where for each employee, there must be a record
for every possible pairing of one of his skills with one of his languages: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |
| Smith    | cook  | German   |
| Smith    | cook  | Greek    |
| Smith    | type  | French   |
| Smith    | type  | German   |
| Smith    | type  | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Other problems caused by violating fourth normal form are similar in spirit to those
mentioned earlier for violations of second or third …</p></div></div>

August 9, 2020 | https://ahsmart.com/pub/juliacon2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ahsmart.com/pub/juliacon2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span> Aug 8, 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 mins read</span></p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_background_art.png" alt="juliacon"></p>
<p>The year of 2020 is interesting as the COVID-19 pandemic forces everyone to really think about how they communicate and work with each other. Technology conferences are hit particularly hard. As most people cannot travel anymore, and with the constraint of social distancing, it has become impractical to organize physical conferences anymore.</p>
<p>I just finished <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/">JuliaCon 2020</a> and I had a great experience.  So I would like to share my thoughts here.</p>

<p>JuliaCon has made a new record this year.</p>
<p>To get a taste of the scale, JuliaCon 2019 had about 400 attendees. In 2020, over 10,000 people registered prior to the conference. Dr. Viral Shah, co-founder and CEO of Julia Computing, reported 24,000 unique visitors at the YouTube channel by the end of the conference.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_24000_viewers.png" alt="viewer stats"></p>
<p>It is known that the Julia Language has been doubling its users every year.  So there is already a popularity effect.  However, the combination of a free conference that anybody can participate online from anywhere in the world makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>Reference: <strong><em>Julia has been downloaded more than 17 million times and is used at more than 1,500 universities</em></strong> from Julia Computing's <a href="https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2020/07/17/julia-con.html">July 2020 newsletter</a>. By contrast, the <a href="https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/07/02/july-newsletter.html">July 2019 newsletter</a> claimed 9 million downloads.</p>

<p>When you go to a physical conference, you usually attend a session by sitting there and watching the speaker talk for half an hour.  You probably keep quiet and possibly taking some notes during the talk. When the talk is finished, you may have a few minutes to chat with some people around you and share with each other about any thoughts of the the session.</p>
<p><strong>At a virtual conference, the communication style is completely changed.</strong></p>
<p>In particular, the JuliaCon organizers set up a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> server as a primary chat platform. The talks were all pre-recorded (except keynotes) so that the videos can start and finish on time.</p>
<p><strong>Now, two interesting things happen as everyone watched the talk at the same time:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The attendees were very chatty. People started asking questions and leaving comments on Discord about the topic or when they encountered any kind of “ah-ha” moments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The speaker actually engages with the attendees and answering questions on Discord.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a part of the conversations that happened during the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_8kW8nlElY">The ups and downs of convincing to switch to Julia in a company</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_discord3.png" alt="discord"></p>
<p><strong>That's an important change in dynamics.</strong> Never before, the speaker of the talk is able to engage with such a wide spectrum of audience and have a meaningful conversation online, in real-time.</p>

<p>If I were to attend the conference at Lisbon, I would have prepared two large posters for my <a href="https://github.com/tk3369/BinaryTraits.jl">BinaryTraits.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tk3369/ContextTracking.jl">ContextTracking.jl</a> packages. Since the conference became online, I have to create PDF files that is optimized for online viewing.  In other words, they look more like slides than posters.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_my_posters.png" alt="posters"></p>
<p><strong>How do we engage with people that are just “stopping by”?</strong></p>
<p>JuliaCon organized two separate 90-minute poster sessions.  Each session covers approximately 15-20 posters.  The arrangement is that a single audio channel is open for the session.</p>
<p><strong>It was a little awkward if the poster presenters just sit there and wait for people to ask questions.</strong></p>
<p>We decided to have each presenter spend few minutes to explain his/her poster.  A moderator helped arrange and lined up the presenters.  After the presentation, attendees can go to the specific poster chat channel on Discord for further conversations.</p>
<p>For a physical conference, people sometimes get bored sitting in the talks and so they walk around and find the poster sessions and chat with people around. At an online conference, this behavior doesn't exist - when I get bored, I just walk around my house rather than visiting a poster session. For that reason, I feel that the poster sessions were a little under-represented. </p>

<p>One of the best things about attending a conference is to meet people that are like-minded.  As the attendees come from different background, you are able to learn from each other across different industries, technologies, etc. This kind of massive cross-pollination really helps innovation.</p>
<p>At a virtual conference, it becomes more challenging.  Chatting on Discord isn’t the same as talking to someone face to face.  For that reason, the JuliaCon organizers came up with two very interesting ideas - <em>Gather Town</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p><strong>A Gather Town was set up so that you can just walk around a virtual map and meet up with other attendees. Here, let me thank the <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather Town</a> developers for their generosity and support of the conference.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_map.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p>The app runs in the browser without any software installation.  Once you sign in with a name, you can start walking around and explore different areas.  When you get close to another attendee, a video stream instantly pops up at the top and you can start chatting with each other.  The technology is peer-to-peer.  It runs fairly smoothly up to about 8 people.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_gather_boat_chat.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p>To spice up the fun, Ian Butterworth, the same person that introduced Gather Town to the Julia community, partnered up with Cormullion, author of <a href="https://juliamono.netlify.app/">JuliaMono font</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl">Luxor.jl</a>, to create a wormhole in the map. When you fall in the wormhole, you can experience a whole different kind of world. After exploring 5 levels of the worlds, you can return to the regular JuliaCon lobby.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_wormhole_pi.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_wormhole_illuminati.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p>I could see probably around 75 people at Gather Town during peak time. Perhaps not everyone is comfortable doing video chats yet. I imagine that may change in the future as online video chat becomes a normal activity. </p>
<p>In addition, a Minecraft server was created. The JuliaCon was originally planned to be in Lisbon, Portugal, until we all got hit by the pandemic.  The Minecraft server has a mini Lisbon town center created for attendees to get a taste of of Lisbon. I did not sign in to the Minecraft server but let me share the following image contributed by Ahan Sengupta.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_minecraft.png" alt="minecraft"></p>
<p>Having these kinds of virtual worlds makes the conference experience more fun and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Another thoughtful idea with this year’s JuliaCon was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sECiJ59hPXg&amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6TXDX1I1hH_SM49zSxdnSYJ&amp;index=7">daily podcasts</a> during the conference.  Some of the most influential people from the Julia community were invited to the podcasts for interviews. </p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_podcast.png" alt="podcast"></p>
<p>The best part is that the content of the podcast was largely influenced by suggestions/comments from the attendees.  Every day, the hosts would ask everyone to submit who they want to see in the upcoming episodes 👇👇👇</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_podcast_note.png" alt="podcast note"></p>
<p>The last episode of the podcast also includes a collage of short clips from the attendees. That really made the conference experience first-class. I certainly feel very engaged when attending the conference.</p>

<p>Because the talks are pre-recorded, the speakers had a lot of flexibility in preparing the video. For example, if the recording turned out to be too long, then the speaker could just increase the frame rate by 10-25% to make it fit the conference session time limit.</p>
<p>Apparently, Keno Fischer's beard was totally prepared just for the conference and he shaved it off immediately after the conference.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_keno_beard.png" alt="keno's beard"></p>
<p>In summary, I had a great experience at JuliaCon this year. The virtual experience was even better than a physical one in some ways. I do miss the chance of having a more physical interaction with the community, like having a boat ride or having casual conversations over lunches/dinner.</p>
<p>Hats off to the JuliaCon organizers! They have done an amazing job during this difficult time.</p>
<p>I hope it will be just as fun in the years forward.

                        <p>In finance, everyone knows about compound interest. You’ve got a pile of stuff (usually money) that can grow on its own. It grows in proportion to the size of the pile. The bigger the pile gets, the more it grows. You can make the pile bigger in two ways. You can add to it yourself. Or, you can just let it grow on its own over time. For example, you can put your money in a bank account. Then, you add a little money to it every month, and the bank pays you interest for letting them hold your money. Your money grows. Even if you stopped adding your own money, the bank would keep paying you interest. Your money pile would continue to grow. </p><p>History is filled with three kinds of people: the kind who reap the benefits of compound interest, the kind who miss out on it, and the kind who get shafted by it. Remember, the bigger the pile, the more it can grow. Over time, this can make you very rich. Unless of course your pile periodically shrinks or catches fire and turns to ashes, or you blow it on something silly.</p><p>Compound interest can be slow at the start, but once it builds momentum, it takes off like nothing else. It’s an exponential process. Slow at first, but as fast as a mad squirrel on twelve shots of espresso towards the end. If your money grows with compound interest and your competition’s money doesn’t, you will eventually leave your competition in the dust. Even if they have a better start. </p><figure><img src="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png" alt="" srcset="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 1000w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 1600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 1700w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Given enough time, compound growth can overtake linear growth without fail. Here, despite the yellow line starting higher, compound growth (teal) overtakes it in just 6 years and quickly pulls away.</figcaption></figure><p>You might have heard of a gentleman by the name of John Williams. He’s a film composer. When he was a kid, he learned how to use a handful of tools. He learned how to use a pencil, paper, an eraser, and a piano. And then he went off and did something absolutely remarkable, especially by our modern standards. He kept using pencil, paper, eraser, and piano for the next eight decades of his life. I know. It’s a wholly bizarre and staggering concept in our world where there are 8,000 ways to keep a checklist on your pocket-sized supercomputer.</p><p>So, this Williams fellow has written music for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters, Jaws, the Olympics, Harry Potter, Schindler’s List, and hundreds of these incredibly successful movies, TV shows, and even concert works with nothing but pencil, paper, eraser, and piano.</p><p>Now, you turn around and look at what we all do in the modern world. We’re always retooling. People who code keep switching to the next best thing. They change text editors, languages, keyboard arrangements, you name it. Musicians switch their music-making software, the musical instruments they play, the samples they use. Let’s not get started on productivity people and their million schemes for keeping checklists. If you write checklist/todo/task apps, you're basically in a recursive new market. Just write a new one every year or so and you'll have and endless stream of customers. </p><p>It’s all done in the name of experimenting, but really, everyone’s playing a lottery and hoping to get lucky. “What tool can I find that’ll make me successful?”</p><p>As people wade through the crap, on the rare chance that the stars align, they happen on something really good. You’d be surprised <a href="https://money.com/gold-silver-platinum-sewage-study/">what you can find in sewers</a>. So now you’ve also got this addictive mechanism at play. Nothing tickles the gooey grey jelly in between our ears like random rewards. You grind through a bunch of tools, and then from time to time you get a nice blast of dopamine. So you get hooked on the search. You just want to find the next dopamine hit.</p><p>I think there's something funny going on. Everyone’s playing musical chairs with their tools and, now this could just be me, but I’m not seeing anything dramatically more compelling than what people could do with the tools a decade ago, or even twenty years ago.</p><p>Yeah we’ve got a lot more power at our disposal, yeah we’ve got much better access to a variety of tools, but at the individual level you don’t see a lot of divergence. Writers today aren’t exactly out-producing a Voltaire or Lope de Vega in quantity, let alone quality. No one's coding circles around John Carmack with his quaint C++. How could they? Who's got time to write code in the midst of all the new languages they could be learning. </p><p>Again go back and look at film music. Are people writing music that’s 10 times better than John Williams? No. Some even argue the quality of film music isn’t as artisanal these days. But that’s subjective. Are people today able to write 10 more music than a man who was born closer in time to Tchaikovsky than to today? An old man who uses an archaic pencil, paper, an eraser and a piano to write his music? No. Most composers are far less prolific. And the few that are more prolific are only modestly so. Hans Zimmer has &nbsp;spent many orders of magnitude more money on his studio than John Williams on his. I wouldn’t say he’s orders of magnitudes more prolific or even subjectively better.</p><p>Most of us are accomplishing nothing, because we’re trapped searching for something to help us accomplish something.</p><h2 id="the-great-search-has-great-costs-">The great search has great costs.</h2><p>The great search can occasionally pay off. That’s not the problem. The problem is when the search doesn’t stop. The search means you find a pile of money....and then you set fire to it and go looking for a slightly bigger pile of money. Okay, it might not be that bad. Certain skills transfer, so you take some money over with you. But you never give a pile the time it needs to grow and compound. So unless you get really lucky and find a pile that’s enormous, you’re missing out on compounding effects.</p><p>It’s like you put $1,000 in some magic bank account that returns 5% every year, and after a year you say, "what the hell I only have $1,050? I’m going to go look for something that has $1,100 in it." So, you spend another three years finding and burning piles of money looking for the one that starts a little bigger and then you find it. Of course if you do the math, by the time you find the pile that’s worth $1,100, the original pile, if you’d stuck to it, would be worth $1220. </p><p>There are costs to retooling. There’s a time cost. There’s the cost of the tool itself. And importantly, you lose, if not all of your compounding effects, you lose enough to hold you back.</p><figure><img src="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png" alt="" srcset="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 1000w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 1600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 1742w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Every time you retool you lose a little bit of your compounded interest. Over the long run this can slow you down a lot, as you can see with the grey line compared to the teal line. The exception is if you get lucky and you retool to something that gets you equal or better to the teal line.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I imagine that in his late eighties, &nbsp;John Williams feels like pencil, paper, eraser, and piano are extensions of his body, mind, and soul. He doesn’t need to figure out how a pencil works or how to draw a note. There’s no confusion about what the black keys on the piano do versus the white keys. So he can be free to create, express, tinker, and experiment.</p><p>Once he gets to that point, he’s got a clear edge. The more you can experiment, the more you can tinker without being obstructed by things like “what the heck does this button do?” the more prolific you can be. You can be prolific at a much higher quality.</p><p>At age 88, John Williams is writing scraps that others can’t even dream about.</p><p>Would John Williams be more creative and have more musical opportunities if he adopted music notation software or a DAW instead of sticking to paper, pencil, eraser, and piano? It’s possible he would do things differently. But is there something that software does that his tools can’t achieve? I’d argue not.</p><p>I’d actually argue that you have the opposite problem. Simpler tools give you far more flexibility than more complicated tools. With pencil and paper Williams can invent a whole new way to explore and write down his music. He can doodle pictures in the margins when he gets bored. He can scribble down an idea for later. The more complicated the tool, the more locked workflows there are. Complicated tools are someone else’s <em>designed</em> workflow. By definition, they lock you into that workflow. The best tools let you design your own workflow. Pencil and paper win there. With his pencil and paper, John Williams has a lot of freedom in how he approaches music than someone who is writing in a DAW.</p><p>That's a lot of why we switch tools. The designed workflows don't meet our needs, so we go searching for something that does. Maybe instead of searching for other designed workflows, you'd be better off stepping back and finding a simpler tool for the job? </p><p>I’m not saying you can’t stumble on something that will unleash a personal golden age for you. But it’s unlikely that you will. Just the same, I’m not saying sticking to your tools will guarantee success. But it will make it more likely.</p><p>Success is a function of performance and luck. You need to be good and you need to be lucky. Sticking to your tools improves your performance with those tools, and indirectly it makes it more likely that you get lucky. See, when you know your tools well, you perform better, and when you perform better, you can be more prolific. A person who is prolific has more chances to be lucky than a person who isn't prolific. </p><p>What the modern world does really well is expand access to tools. That means more people have access to a lot more potential. But here's the thing, a lot of that potential is locked up in compound interest. You have to stick with something to really unlock its power. Ideally, stick with the simplest tool that helps you do what you need. </p><h2 id="it-s-okay-to-enjoy-the-search-">It’s okay to enjoy the search.</h2><p>You might be worried about being too specialized.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>High performing teams thrive on accountability. Accountability is the foundation for a culture that gets stuff done: if you say you’ll do something, we all trust that it will happen. Accountability is empowering, creates great opportunities for learning, and allows the company to move faster. You can’t succeed in a competitive environment without it.</p>

<p>The more complex your organization, the more elusive accountability becomes. Startups foster learning because they’re high-accountability arenas: it’s immediately obvious when Bob isn’t towing the line. As a company scales, accountability easily gets lost if ownership isn’t well-defined and outcomes aren’t immediately observable. When things go well, people claim any victory that occurred in their area code as their own. When they go poorly, people skitter away to dusty corners of the org chart or just make excuses. This leads to a vicious cycle of eroding trust, heavyweight management processes, and disempowerment.</p>

<p>Eventually, when enough balls get dropped, leadership makes big, all-or-nothing decisions that either abandon accountability altogether or are overly harsh. The senior people in the vicinity of a big win get promoted. People find scapegoats. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid this inevitable landmine? Get high-quality accountability from transparency.</p>

<h2 id="why-transparency-works">Why Transparency Works</h2>

<p>The first reason that transparency leads to accountability: <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/we-work-harder-when-we-know-someones-watching">people rise to the occasion when they know they have an audience</a>, and transparency gives your team a front row seat to the action. Put another way, people (generally) don’t want to publicly screw up. The light peer pressure of transparency immediately delivers results.</p>

<p>On healthy teams, people want to see their teammates succeed and will lend a hand if they see something falling off-track. But most people don’t want to go to their teammates with some form of “hey, it looks like you’re screwing up.” Transparency lowers the friction involved in asking or offering help.</p>

<p>Transparency also gives you observability well before the train flies off the tracks. Imagine the conversations below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Hey Bob, at the last 2 standups you said you were planning to get to Project X next. Still on-track for launch on the first of the month? Let me know if there are blockers I can help with, or if we should discuss whether it even still makes sense as a priority.”</li>
  <li>“Hey Bob, why did X not get done? We had planned for it to be done by the first of the month. What happened?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these conversations will get you to accountability, but the former conversation is infinitely easier. It’s early, and there is time to get help or adjust plans. There’s also still room for nuance – does it still make sense to spend our time here at all? By contrast, the latter conversation is an adversarial nightmare and almost guaranteed to elicit a defensive reaction. Transparency allows you to aim small, and therefore miss small.</p>

<p>Finally, if a project truly does fail, transparency helps you address it correctly and fairly.</p>

<p>There’s usually a pretty reasonable explanation when things go wrong. Were our goals unrealistic? Did other priorities get in the way? Did some exogenous factor throw a wrench into our plans? Or, are we in the (relatively uncommon) situation where someone was simply lazy or incompetent? As a manager, you owe it to your team to have a nuanced response to what is almost certainly a nuanced situation.</p>

<p>Transparency gives you a clear trail to understand and take action – which is the bedrock upon which true accountability rests. Trying to get accountability without transparency is like doing brain surgery with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-achieve-transparency">How to Achieve Transparency</h2>

<p>You can achieve transparency through a variety of methods, all centered around tracking true indicators of productivity or progress towards goals.</p>

<p>Tools for transparency should be neutral, objective, and predictable – think of metrics dashboards or a weekly team check-in, rather than a manager nosing in and asking for a status report on a whim. The best forms of transparency are impersonal as they’re rooted in facts and data, not opinions and explanations. They should be at least semi-public: shared between a manager and report, with a team, or with the entire company. And most importantly, transparency efforts must be lightweight: the benefit of more transparency is increased accountability and observability without a decrease in velocity.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite lightweight ways to get more transparency are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make business metrics that you care about public to the company, and automatically publish them to an email list / public chat channel at a regular cadence. For example, create a public Slack channel in which you post metrics such as renewal rate, number of news signups, or number of support tickets per active user once a month.</li>
  <li>Use standups (of any form – live or virtual) to keep projects on track. The key is to follow up on hurdles that have blocked progress for some time as soon as things are off track – standup should be an active listening exercise.</li>
  <li>It’s easy for the “last 10%” of projects to take as much time to complete as the first 90%. As you’re approaching the end of a project, teams should track their current best guess for when a project will go live.</li>
  <li>On a quarterly basis, send everyone in the organization an anonymous poll rating their current job satisfaction on a few key dimensions, and have the CEO / other executives follow up with the heads of large functional groups that report to them.</li>
  <li>For any complex and sensitive business-critical process (e.g. deploying risky code or launching new products to customers), set up a checkin meeting to talk about all upcoming launches. The existence of the public checkin is a strong forcing function for people to run a tight ship.</li>
  <li>If you use an Agile system with sprints, track metrics such as points completed per sprint, average time that stories have been in-progress, or percentage of sprints in which all work is completed.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich 5.1.0</a> adds the ability to integrate highlighted pretty printing with the Python REPL. Here's how you would use it in a session:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from rich import pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty.install()
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming you have <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#installation">installed Rich</a> of course.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Everyone knows how to track which processes run on Linux, but almost no-one tracks them accurately. In fact, <strong>all</strong> of the methods listed in this post have some deficiency or another. Lets define requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>All processes should be logged including short-lived processes</li>
<li>We should know the full executable path of every process that runs</li>
<li>Within reason, we shouldn’t need to modify or recompile our code for different kernel versions</li>
<li>Bonus: If the host is a Kubernetes node or runs docker than we should be able to determine which pod/container a process belongs to. To do so, it is often sufficient to know a process’ cgroup ID. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Lets looks at common Linux APIs that can solve this problem. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on detecting <code>execve</code> syscalls. A full solution will also need to monitor <code>fork</code>/<code>clone</code> syscalls and their variants as well <code>execveat</code>.</p>

<h3 id="simple-usermode-solutions">Simple Usermode Solutions</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Poll <code>/proc</code></strong>. This is no good because it will miss short-lived processes.</li>
<li><strong>Use the netlink process connector</strong>. The connector will deliver notifications for short-lived processes but the notifications only include numerical data like the process’ <code>pid</code> without data like the executable path. Therefore, you’re back to reading data from <code>/proc</code> and have the same race condition for short-lived processes.</li>
<li><strong>Use the Linux audit API.</strong> This is the best solution out there. The audit API exists in all modern kernels, provides full executable paths, and won’t miss short-lived processes. There are only two disadvantages. First of all, only one usermode program can communicate with the kernel audit API at a time. This is a pain if you are developing an enterprise security solution and have customers who use the audit API themselves via <code>auditd</code> or <code>osquery</code>.<sup id="fnref:audit"><a href="#fn:audit">2</a></sup> Second of all, the audit API isn’t container aware, despite years of kernel mailing list discussions on fixing the issue.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="simple-kernel-debugging-solutions">Simple Kernel Debugging Solutions</h3>

<p>These solutions all involve a single kernel probe of various types.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use tracepoints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> .</strong> The kernel contains several relevant tracepoints which execute at different points in the <code>execve</code> syscall. They are: <em>sched_process_exec</em>, <em>open_exec</em>, <em>sys_enter_execve</em>, <em>sys_exit_execve</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup> These tracepoints are better than the previous solutions because they will track short-lived processes, but none of these tracepoints provide an executable’s full path when the parameter to <code>exec</code> is a relative path. In other words, if the user runs <code>cd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls</code> then the path will be reported as <code>./ls</code> and not <code>/bin/ls</code>. Here is a simple demonstration:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code># enable the sched_process_exec tracepoint
sudo -s
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
echo 1 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable

# run ls via a relative path
cd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls

# fetch data from the sched_process_exec tracepoint
# note that we don't see the full path
cd -
cat trace | grep ls

# disable the tracepoint
echo 0 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use kprobes/kretprobes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup>.</strong> Unlike tracepoints, there are many, many possible functions where you can insert a kprobe which will be hit during an <code>execve</code> syscall. However, I can’t find a single function in <code>execve</code>’s callgraph which has as function parameters both the process’ PID and the full path of the executable. Therefore we have the same issue with relative paths as the tracepoint solution. There are some clever hacks you can do here - after all, kprobes can read data from the kernel’s callstack - but these solutions wont be stable across kernel versions so I’m ruling them out.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use eBPF programs with tracepoints/kprobes/kretprobes</strong><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup>. This opens up some new options. Now we can run arbitrary code in the kernel every time that the <code>execve</code> syscall runs. In theory, this should let us extract any information we want from kernel and send it to usermode. There are two ways of obtaining such data and neither meets our requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read data from kernel structs like <code>task_struct</code> or <code>linux_binprm</code>. We can indeed fetch the executable’s full path this way<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">7</a></sup> but reading from kernel structs will make us dependent on kernel versions. Our eBPF program needs to know the offsets of struct members so it has to be compiled with kernel headers for each kernel version. This is typically solved by compiling the eBPF program at runtime, but that brings it’s own issues like a requirement that you have kernel headers available on every machine.</li>
<li>Use eBPF helper functions to fetch data from the kernel. This is compatible across all kernel versions that contain the helper you use. In this method you never access kernel structs directly - rather you use helper APIs to fetch data. There is only one problem: there is no eBPF helper function which can obtain the executable’s full path. (However, in recent kernel versions, there <em>is</em> an eBPF helper function to get the cgroup ID which is useful for mapping processes to containers.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hackish-solutions">Hackish Solutions:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on every running executable and hook <code>exec</code> calls in libc</strong>. Seriously, don’t do this. It won’t work for statically compiled executables, is easy for malicious code to bypass, and is fairly intrusive.</li>
<li><strong>Use tracepoints on <code>execve</code>, <code>fork</code>/<code>clone</code>, and <code>chdir</code> to track not only the creation of all processes but also their current working directory.</strong> For each <code>execve</code> lookup the process’ working directory and combine that with <code>execve</code>’s parameter to obtain a full path. If you do this, make sure you use eBPF maps and put all the logic into your eBPF programs to avoid race conditions where events arrive in usermode in the wrong order.</li>
<li><strong>Use ptrace based solutions</strong>. These are too intrusive for production code. However, if you do go this route then  use ptrace + seccomp and the <code>SECCOMP_RET_TRACE</code> flag. Then seccomp can intercept all <code>execve</code> syscalls in the kernel and pass them to a usermode debugger which can log the <code>execve</code> call before telling seccomp to continue with the <code>execve</code> as usual.</li>
<li><strong>Use AppArmor.</strong> You can write an AppArmor profile which forbids a process from executing any other executables. If you put that profile in complain mode then AppArmor wont actually prevent process execution - it will only issue alerts when the profile is violated. If we attach our profile to every running process then we will have a working but very ugly and hackish solution. You probably shouldn’t do this.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3rd-party-tools">3rd Party Tools</h3>

<p>None of these solutions satisfy our requirements, but here they are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>ps</code></strong> - this just polls from <code>/proc</code> and therefore has the usual race conditions</li>
<li><strong>Use the eBPF-based <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/execsnoop.py">execsnoop</a></strong> - this is just a kprobe/kretprobe based solution so it has the same dependency on kernel versions discussed above. Besides, execsnoop doesn’t even expand relative paths so we have gained nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Use the old non-eBPF version of execsnoop</strong> - this won’t work either. It is just a simple kprobe.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="future-solutions">Future Solutions:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use the eBPF helper function <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/7464919bd9c15f2496ca29dceb6a4048b3199774.1576629200.git.ethercflow@gmail.com/">get_fd_path</a></strong> - this doesn’t yet exist, but once it is added to the kernel it will somewhat help. You’ll still have to get the executable’s FD in a way that doesn’t involve reading from kernel structs.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h3>

<p>None of the APIs covered here are perfect. Here are my recommendations for which solution you should use and when:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you can, use the audit API via <code>auditd</code> or <a href="https://github.com/slackhq/go-audit">go-audit</a>. This will log all processes, including short-lived processes, and you’ll get full executable paths without any effort. This solution wont work if someone is already using the audit API via a different usermode tool than you. In that case, read on.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about full-paths and you want a quick, ready-made solution that doesn’t involve writing any code then use <code>execsnoop</code>. This has the disadvantage of requiring kernel headers at runtime.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about full-paths and you’re willing to go the extra mile to avoid requiring kernel headers then use one of the tracepoints mentioned above. There are multiple ways that you can connect to those tracepoints and transfer their data to usermode - whether it is via the filesystem interface shown above, via an eBPF program with eBPF maps, or via <code>perf</code> tools. I’ll cover these options in another post. The main thing to remember is this: if you use an eBPF program make sure it can be statically compiled so that you don’t have the same dependency on kernel headers that you’re trying to avoid. This means you can’t access kernel structs and you can’t use frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BCC</a> which compile eBPF programs at runtime.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about short-lived processes and the previous solutions don’t fit your use-case then use the netlink process connector in conjunction with <code>/proc</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Despite using a FTTH internet connection since 2014, aside from the one fiber
uplink, I had always used network gear with 1 Gbit/s links over regular old rj45
cat5(e) cables.</p>

<hr>

<p>I liked the simplicity and uniformity of that setup, but decided it’s time to
add at least one fiber connection, to <strong>get rid of a temporary ethernet cable</strong>
that connected my kitchen with the rest of my network that is largely in the
living room and office.</p>

<p>The temporary ethernet cable was an experiment to verify that running a server
or two in my kitchen actually works (it does!). I used a <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/hama-cat-6-flach-we-1000cm-netzwerkkabel-7465292">flat ethernet
cable</a>,
which is great for test setups like that, as you can often tape it onto the
walls and still close the doors.</p>

<p>So, we will replace one ethernet cable with one fiber cable and converters at
each end:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="216" alt="0.9mm thin fiber cables"></a></p>

<p>Why is it good to switch from copper ethernet cables to fiber in this case?
Fiber cables are <strong>smaller and hence easier to fit</strong> into existing cable
ducts. While regular ethernet cable is way too thick to fit into any of the
existing ducts in my flat, I was hoping that fiber might fit!</p>

<p>When I actually received the cables, I was surprised <strong>how much thinner</strong> fiber
cables actually can be: there are 0.9mm cables, which are so thin, they can be
hidden in plain sight! I had only ever seen 2mm fiber cables before, and the
0.9mm cables are incredibly light, flexible and thin! Even pasta is typically
thicker:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="0.9mm thin fiber cables"></a></p>

<p><small><em>Preparing a delicious pot of glass noodles ;)</em></small></p>

<hr>

<p>The cable shown above comes from <a href="https://www.fs.com/company/about_us.html">the fiber store
FS.COM</a>, which different people have
praised on multiple occasions, so naturally I was curious to give them a shot
myself.</p>

<p>Also, for the longest time, it was my understanding that fiber connectors can
only be put onto fiber cables using expensive (≫2000 CHF) machines. A while ago
I heard about <strong>field assembly connectors</strong> so I wanted to verify that those
indeed work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside from practical reasons, playing around with fiber networking also makes
for a good hobby during a pandemic :)</p>

<h2 id="hardware-selection">Hardware Selection</h2>

<p>I ordered all my fiber equipment at <a href="https://www.fs.com/">FS.COM</a>: everything
they have is very affordable, and products in stock at their German warehouse
arrive in Switzerland (and presumably other European countries) within the same
week.</p>

<p>If you are in the luxurious position to have enough physical space and agility
to pull through an entire fiber cable, <strong>without having to remove any
connectors</strong>, you can make a new network connection with just a few parts:</p>

<p>I recommend buying an extra fiber cable or two so that you can accidentally
damage a cable and still have enough spares.</p>

<p>Total cost thus far: just under 100 CHF. If you have existing switches with a
free SFP slot, you can use those instead of the media converters and save most
of the cost.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you need to <strong>temporarily remove</strong> one or both of the fiber cable connector(s),
you also need field assembly connectors and a few tools in addition:</p>

<p>I recommend buying twice the number of field assembly connectors, for practicing.</p>

<p>Personally, I screwed up two connectors before figuring out <a href="#field-assembly-connectors">how the process
goes</a>.</p>

<p>Total cost: about 160 CHF for the field assembly equipment, so 260 CHF in total.</p>

have, but you can get by without, if you’re on a budget.</p>

<p>With the visual fault locator, you can shine a light through your fiber. You can
verify correct connector assembly by looking at how the light comes out of the
connector.</p>

<p>The fiber cleaning swabs are good to have in general, but for the field assembly
connector, you need to use alcohol-soaked wipes anyway (which FS.COM does not
stock).</p>

<p>The total cost for everything is just under 300 CHF.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-selection-process">Hardware Selection Process</h3>

<p>The large selection at FS.COM can be overwhelming to navigate at first. My
selection process went something like this:</p>

<p>My first constraint is using bi-directional (BiDi) fiber optics modules so that
I only need to lay a single fiber cable, as opposed to two fiber cables.</p>

<p>The second constraint is to use field assembly connectors.</p>

<p>If possible, I wanted to use <a href="https://community.fs.com/blog/why-not-use-bend-insensitive-fiber-optic-cable-to-reduce-bend-radius.html">bend-insensitive
fiber</a>
so that I wouldn’t need to pay so much attention to the bend radius and have
more flexibility in where and how I can lay fiber.</p>

<p>With these constraints, there aren’t too many products left to combine. An
obvious and good choice are 0.9mm fiber cable using LC/UPC connectors.</p>

<h3 id="fs-com-details">FS.COM details</h3>

<p>As of 2020-08-05, FS.COM states they have 5 warehouses in 4 locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delaware (US)</li>
<li>Munich (Germany)</li>
<li>Melbourne (Australia)</li>
<li>Shenzhen (China)</li>
</ul>

<p>They recently built another, bigger (7 km²) warehouse in Shenzhen, and now
produce inventory for the whole year.</p>

<p>By 2019, FS.COM had over 300,000 registered corporate customers, reaching nearly
200 million USD yearly sales.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-times">Delivery times</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, delivery times are quick when the products are in stock at
FS.COM’s German warehouse.</p>

<p>In my case, I put in my order on 2020-Jun-26.</p>

<p>The items that shipped from the German warehouse arrived on 2020-Jul-01.</p>

<p>Some items had to be manufactured and/or shipped from Asia. Those items arrived
after 3 more weeks, on 2020-Jul-24.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, FS.COM doesn’t stock any 0.9mm fiber cables in their German
warehouse right now, so be prepared for a few weeks of waiting time.</p>

<h2 id="laying-the-fiber">Laying The Fiber</h2>

<p>Use a cable puller to pull the fiber through existing cable ducts where
possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In general, buy the thinnest one you can find. I have <a href="https://www.distrelec.ch/en/cable-pull-strap-10m-tools-495005/p/18092626">this 4mm diameter cable
puller</a>,
but a 3mm or even 2mm one would work in more situations.</p></li>

<li><p>I found it worthwhile to buy a brand one. It is distinctly better to handle
(less stiff, i.e. more flexible) than the cheap one I got, and thinner, too,
which is always good.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience, it generally did not work well to <strong>push</strong> the fiber into an
existing duct or alongside an existing cable. I really needed a cable
<strong>puller</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky and have enough space in your duct(s), you can leave the
existing connectors on the fiber. I have successfully just used a piece of tape
to fix the fiber connector on the cable puller, pushing down the nose
temporarily:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable taped to cable puller"></a></p>

<p>Where there are no existing ducts, you may need to lay the fiber on top of the
wall. Obviously, this is tricky as soon as you need to make a connection going
through a wall: whereas copper ethernet cables can be bent and squeezed into
door frames, you quickly risk breaking fiber cables.</p>

<p>Luckily, the fiber is very light, so it’s very easy to fix to the wall with a
piece of tape:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cables on the wall"></a></p>

<p>You can see the upstream internet fiber in the top right corner, which is rather
thick in comparison to my 0.9mm yellow fiber that’s barely visible in the middle
of the picture.</p>

<p>Note how the fiber entirely disappears behind the existing duct atop the
door!</p>

<p>Above, you can see the flat ethernet cable I have been using as a temporary
experiment.</p>

<p>Where there is an existing cable that you can temporarily remove, it might be
possible to remove it, put the fiber in, and put the old cable back in,
too. This is possible because the 0.9mm fiber cable is so thin!</p>

<p>I’m using this technique to cross another wall where the existing cable duct is
too full, but there is a cable that can be removed and put back after pulling
the fiber through:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing cable"></a></p>

<p>…and on the other side of the wall:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>Note how the fiber is thin enough to fit between the socket and duct!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> despite measuring how long a fiber cable I would need, my cable turned
out too short! While the cable was just as long as I had measured, with
distances exceeding 10m, it is a good idea to <strong>add a few meters spare</strong> on each
side of the connection.</p>

<h2 id="field-assembly-connectors">Field assembly connectors</h2>

<p>To give you an overview, these are the required steps at a high level:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14346.html">Fibre Optic Kevlar Cutter</a></li>
<li>Strip the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/72812.html">Fibre Optical Stripper</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>jacket</em> onto the fiber</li>
<li>Cut the stripped fiber cleanly with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14341.html">High Precision Fibre Optic Cleaver FS-08C</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>connector</em> onto the fiber</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I thought the following resources were useful:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pictograms: <a href="https://img-en.fs.com/file/user_manual/lc-field-assembly-connector-quick-start-guide-v1.0.pdf">PDF: FS.COM LC UPC field assembley connectors quick start
guide</a></li>
<li>Pictures: <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/35165.html">Installation Procedure on
FS.COM</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epTzemeJjAw">YouTube: Terminate Fiber in 5
Minutes</a>: this video shows a
different product, but I found it helpful to see any field assembly connector
on video, and this is one of the better videos I could find.</li>
</ol>

<!-- TODO: include a link to my own video once published -->

<hr>

<p><strong>Beware:</strong> the little paper booklet that comes with the field assembly
connector contains measurements which are <strong>not to scale</strong>. I have suggested to
FS.COM that they fix this, but until then, you’ll need to use e.g. a tape
measure.</p>

<hr>

<p>For establishing an intuition of their different sizes, here are the different connectors:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>From left to right:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.0mm fiber cable</li>
<li>cat6 ethernet cable</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC factory)</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC field assembly connector)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 0.9mm fiber cables come with smaller connectors than the 2.0mm fiber cables,
and that alone might be a reason to prefer them in some situations.</p>

<p>The field assembly connectors are pretty bulky in comparison, but since you can
attach them yourself after pulling only the cable through the walls and/or
ducts, you usually don’t care too …</p></div></div>

    <p>A hypothetical 5-year-old asks "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball!  Awesome!  What color is the ball?".  Anecdotally, most astronomy graduate students will get this wrong.  And some professors.  So at least some science education misconceptions - basic, simple, significant, and easily falsifiable - are not restricted to introductory classes.  They persist into the profession, where they compromise textbooks, despite collaboration.  And survive for decades, despite awareness efforts.  Being largely ignored, it's an open question how typical this is,  and how much educational content might be improved by addressing it.  But for now, for correct crayon choice, ask a spectroscopist.</p>

        <p>
          Are you tired of seeing wonderful insights in research talks, and knowing they won't reach introductory content for years?  I suggest the importance of direct research expertise, in creating accessible and powerful introductory content, is pervasively underestimated.
        </p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.clarifyscience.info/part/Atv6U">"What color is the Sun?" - <i>your</i> answer?</a></b>
    </p></div>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The last decade of science education research surprised the education community. Student understanding turned out to be poorly integrated, non-transferable, and riddled with misconceptions. But an assumption exists, that student understanding eventually gets fixed.  That over the course of undergraduate and graduate work, ramshackle novice understanding becomes a qualitatively different expert understanding.  At least within the field studied.</p>
      <p>Here is one misconception that persists.  I suggest it illustrates a larger problem, with implications for curriculum and content creation.  And that we need to reassess who has sufficient expertise to create accessible and insightful content.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>A 5-year-old comes up to you and asks "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball!  Awesome!  What color is the ball?"</p>
      <p>Take a moment, and say an answer.</p>
      <p>Anecdotally, most astronomy graduate students will get this wrong.  And at least some astronomy faculty.  For correct crayon choice, it appears the 5-year-old should ask a spectroscopist.</p>
      <p>Why?  In textbooks, the question isn't a focus, and its treatment is usually ambiguous.  The underlying problem I'll describe later.  The issue is known, with years of folks pointing out confused students and colleagues.  But awareness remains low, and little changes.</p>
      <p>The intriguing question is, how much better might content become, if more and better experts were used.  If a spectroscopist, rather than confused faculty, were asked "What color is the Sun?"  If K picture books, and graduate astronomy texts, both got the crayon color right.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Asking the question</h2>
      <p>
        'A hypothetical 5-year-old asks
        "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball.  Awesome!  What color is the ball?"'
        I've asked this, conversationally, for several years.
        Small n, some tens, mostly MIT and Harvard graduate students.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting it wrong</h2>
      <p>
        I see five common answers, plus a few outliers.
        </p><ul>
          <li><i>yellow</i></li>
          <li><i>orange</i> and yellow and red</li>
          <li><i>rainbow</i>: "it doesn't have a color"; "it's lots of different colors"; "it's rainbow color"</li>
          <li><i>white</i></li>
          <li><i>5700 K</i></li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>
        The answer I expect depends on the person.
        </p><ul>
          <li>From the public, I expect <i>orange</i> or <i>yellow</i>.</li>
          <li>From astronomy students, undergraduate and graduate, I expect <i>yellow</i>, with a small minority of <i>white</i>.</li>
          <li>From astronomy post-docs, I've seen <i>white</i> and <i>yellow</i>.</li>
          <li>From non-astronomy graduate students in physical sciences, I expect <i>rainbow</i> or <i>yellow</i>, but also see the others.  I've seen <i>rainbow</i> from post-docs in several fields.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>
        <i>Yellow</i> is the most common answer.  A follow-up question of "what color is sunlight?" almost always results in recognition that something is wrong.
        <i>White</i> is an infrequent answer in all groups, except for astronomy post-docs, for whom I can't say.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>White</i> is unambiguously the correct answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is going on?
        "The Sun ball is white" is a concept accessible to 5-year-olds.
        So why do astronomy graduate students not know what color the Sun is?
        Why do physical-sciences graduate students not even know what <i>color</i> is?
        What implications might these have for science education content creation?
      </p>
      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <p>
        This failure mode is at least arguably atypical.  But it's existence has implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A misconception can... persist into graduate school.</b>
        While this is a single example, there is literature on ramshackle understanding persisting into professions.
        At least some of the perception that "misconceptions resolve" appears similar to the familiar "our teaching simply <i>must</i> be working" fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A misconception can... be an artifact of the field, not just of pedagogy.</b>
        With a feedback loop between misconception and poor content, stable for decades.
        In the current case, the field is unable to bring its collective understanding to bear on creating content.
        Diffusion of knowledge within the field, and textbooks' "hundreds of collaborators", are here not sufficient.
        Even in this field with a singular emphasis on terminal introductory courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Creating content requires better experts.  And more of them.</b>
        Not merely random faculty, whose expertise outside of their specific research area, unsurprisingly looks much like a graduate student.  For example.  An MIT microbiology professor writes a nifty children's' picture book on photosynthesis.  With such concern for correctness, that it has an errata page... which doesn't (yet) mention, the book's yellow Sun(s). This shouldn't surprise you now - an astronomy consult was needed for correct <span>crayon</span> paint choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Understanding can be poorly integrated and exercised.</b>
        "Sunlight is white" and "the Sun is yellow", don't make sense together.  Yet many astronomy graduate students believe both.   This undetected conflict among conceptions, demonstrates the existence of poorly integrated knowledge.  But they also instantly recognize them as inconsistent, when both are mentioned in these conversations.  Suggesting a long-term failure to exercise knowledge - that in all their years of study, these two concepts haven't collided before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Content could be better.  Much.</b>
        Consider integrated and transferable knowledge.  Well shaped and chosen building blocks, exercised to knock off misconceptions, fit and fused together as foundation and scaffolding.
        If you believe "the Sun is yellow", that misshaped block interferes with others.  Many related concepts don't make sense:
        blackbodies; star color; blue sky; how color works; and others.
        Making them in turn harder to learn.  And discouraging exercise, over this broken pavement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get it right, get it insightful, get it understood without misconceptions.  Even if failures to achieve these were rare, their impact could still be large.  And instead of rare, they are pervasive.  Suggesting the improvements in content over the coming decades, will not be a thing of refinement and decoration.  But something much more profound.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        How common is astronomy graduate students not knowing what color the Sun is?  And astronomy professors?  We don't know.  These anecdotes don't stretch that far.  I look forward to someone testing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is clear, is that at least some graduate students are confused.  In ways that surprise people.  And which suggest content needs to be better.  And can be.

      </p>
      <h2>Methods - Question design</h2>
      <p>
        The core question is "What color is the Sun?".  The rest is there to constrain people's answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "ball" helps clarify intent - 'object, viewed from space', not 'eyeball observation made through atmosphere'.  It works well, but not always.  Some "red or orange" responses remain.  And it creates guarded "well, under &lt;some eyeball condition&gt;, it looks &lt;color&gt;" responses.  These can be fixed with a reply like "yes, and viewed through rock it's black - but what is it itself?".  Cone saturation almost never comes up.
        </p><p>
          The "5-year-old" is better way of saying "one-word common color name".  Getting such names from people is <i>hard</i>.  As is creating recognition that not providing one constitutes failing to answer the question.  Without the 5-year-old, puzzled people start rifting through everything they vaguely remember that might be related, and finally end with a "did I get it?".  Some responses of "5700 Kelvin" remain, but can be fixed by replying "5-year-old!", or "the 5-year-old looks puzzled".  The 5-year-old also makes the conversation more upbeat - 'helping a child', instead of 'suffering a quiz'.  And it reduces the frequency of "well, does it really matter what color the Sun is?".
        </p>
        <p>
          The "What color is sunlight?" follow-up is an easy way to demonstrate that some answer was wrong.  The "sunlight is white" meme is widespread, and its recitation so reflexive, that the response almost always precedes the "oh, then that doesn't make sense, does it?" moment.  It also provides a nice illustration of knowledge being poorly …</p></div></div></div>

August 9, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018 I applied for and received Permanent Residency in Japan. The process I
used is relatively new and unknown so I wanted to document it in case it might
come in handy for someone else.</p>
<h2 id="my-background"> My Background</h2>
<p>In 2011 I graduated with a Master's degree from Brown University and then moved
to Japan and got a job as a software engineer. I am not married. I am fluent in
Japanese but would not be mistaken for a native speaker. I am a citizen of the
United States.</p>
<h2 id="highly-skilled-foreign-professional"> Highly Skilled Foreign Professional</h2>
<p>There are three main ways to qualify for Permanent Residency in Japan.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can be a resident for 10 years or more on a work visa, or a smaller number of years on a marriage visa.</li>
<li>You can make a significant contribution to Japan (<a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/nyukan_nyukan36.html">我が国への貢献</a>), such as personally contributing to an Olympic victory by coaching, winning a similarly prestigious prize, or getting a medal from the Emperor.</li>
<li>You can use the Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa is a points-based visa system
introduced in 2012. It seems to have been modeled on points-based visa systems
introduced in Australia. The basic idea is that based on things like income,
educational history, and language ability you get points, and if you have
enough points you can apply for a special visa. In 2017, on average 352 people
a month were accepted in the visa program. (see graph 1-3-3 on page 27
<a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000627735.pdf">here</a>)</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the HSFP visa is a fast track to Permanent Residency.
When it was first introduced you could apply for a PR after five years on the
HSFP visa, as opposed to ten years on a normal work visa. Over time the fast
track became even faster, and in 2018 you could apply after three years or even
just one year if you had enough points. What changed in 2017 was that if you
could demonstrate that you had the points historically you could apply for a PR
without ever having the HSFP visa. That's the process I used.</p>
<h2 id="the-points"> The Points</h2>
<p>The way points calculation works is you calculate your points at the start of
the term (so one or three years ago) and at the time of your application for a
PR, and submit a separate point sheet for each of those times.</p>
<p>There are three categories of HSFP visa: academic, specialist/technical, and
business management. I was in the specialist/technical category, which covers
more than 80% of applicants. Some point sources are shared between all three
categories, but they do have significant differences in where most points come
from. For example, if you apply with the academic category, published papers
become an important criteria for points.</p>
<p>Excluding salary, here's my point breakdown. Note that this uses the rules at
the time of my application in 2018, and they have changed slightly since then,
and are likely to continue to change over time. You can view the current points
sheet as an Excel file at the <a href="http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_3/en/evaluate/index.html">Immigration Bureau site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Master's Degree: 20 points</li>
<li>5-7 years of work experience: 10 points</li>
<li>Age less than 30: 15 points</li>
<li>JLPT N1: 15 points</li>
<li>Highly ranked school bonus: 10 points</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a total of 70 points at the time of my application (again, excluding
salary). 70 points is already enough to qualify for the three-year fast track.
A year before my application I only had the JLPT N2 (10 points) for a slightly
lower total of 65. That means that with a salary of five million yen a year or
more (roughly 50,000USD, worth 15 points) I would be eligible for the one-year
fast track.</p>
<p>There are a number of other bonuses I didn't qualify for, or may have qualified
for but didn't investigate because I already had enough points. When the system
was introduced it was relatively hard to get enough points to qualify, but over
time it's gotten easier. For example, initially only the JLPT N1 was worth
points, but later the N2 was added as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason-letter"> The Reason Letter</h2>
<p>Most of the paperwork required for the PR application is unremarkable. One
major exception is the 理由書 or "reason letter". The reason letter is required
when applying for a PR from a work visa, but the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/ZAIRYU_EIJYU/zairyu_eijyu03.html#content:~:text=%E6%B0%B8%E4%BD%8F%E8%A8%B1%E5%8F%AF%E3%82%92%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E3%81%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E7%90%86%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AA%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E3%81%A7%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%80%82">only guidance</a> is
that there is no fixed format. What on earth are you supposed to write in it?</p>
<p>By looking at websites run by immigration lawyers and blog posts from various
people, it seems the conventional wisdom is that you should briefly state your
educational history and how you came to Japan. You also need to explain your
reason for seeking the PR, but "I want to keep living in Japan" is not
appropriate.</p>
<p>Typical reasons to use here are an intention to raise a family or needing a PR
in order to get a loan. (Anyone can own property in Japan, but it's difficult
to get a mortgage if you don't have a PR.) Neither of those applied to me so I
struggled with what to put in the letter. Eventually I settled on describing
several reasons I was invested in staying in Japan, with supporting documentation.</p>
<p>Besides discussing my day job, one point was my work on Japanese NLP projects.
At the time of my application I was working on adding Japanese support to
<a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>, and as part of implementing Universal Dependencies I needed to
contact <a href="https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/">NINJAL</a>, who were incredibly kind in responding to a request from a
random Internet person. I described this as part of an ongoing personal effort
to make Japanese NLP easier, which continues now that I maintain a
popular <a href="https://github.com/SamuraiT/mecab-python3">Python tokenizer for Japanese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/polm">other projects</a>.</p>
<p>Another point was my work with <a href="https://www.tokyoindies.com/">Tokyo Indies</a>, the largest monthly game
development gathering in Tokyo, where I'm on staff. Tokyo Indies had media
coverage from a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/matome/f2books/indies01.html">Famitsu subsidiary</a> and the <a href="https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/mv/wbs/archive?date=2017-10-03">WBS television program</a>,
which made good supporting documents showing both the importance of the event
and my involvement in it.</p>
<p>A third point, different from the first two, was using the reason letter to
explain issues with my other supporting documentation. One of the required
documents for a PR application is a bank statement showing financial
independence in the form of savings or steady income. A few months before my PR
application I broke my leg, and I was unable to walk without crutches for three
months, two of which I was on unpaid leave. The reason letter gave me a place
to explain the situation (and attach X-rays).</p>
<h2 id="the-application-and-the-wait"> The Application and the Wait</h2>
<p>I actually composed my PR application during the considerable downtime I had
after breaking my leg, and went to Immigration on crutches towards the end of
my recovery process. When handing over my documents the person at the counter
was impressed by their tidyness, though all I'd done was use the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/16-4.html#content:~:text=%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%9B%B8%E6%A7%98%E5%BC%8F">officially
provided Excel template</a> to fill it out.</p>
<p>One thing I was told at the counter was that I could provide a copy of my N2
certificate instead of the original. Official instructions say all supporting
documents generally have to be original, but I was told it was OK to copy my
US-issued N2 cert because it was hard to get it replaced. (Looking at <a href="https://www.aatj.org/jlpt-old-scores">current
re-issuance instructions</a> it doesn't look that bad, perhaps the
process has changed since my application.)</p>
<p>I also asked about whether I needed to submit a copy of my degree. I assumed I
didn't since I'd submitted one with my initial visa application years before
and figured it was still on file. I was told it was probably fine without it.
(It wasn't, but I'll get to that later.)</p>
<p>I applied in late January 2018 and was told that it would take a year to
process my application. This was a bit of a surprise, as Immigration's site
said it usually takes 4-6 months. Apparently the recent change in requirements
for PR applications had increased both the number of applicants and the amount
of time required per application as Immigration got used to the new rules.</p>
<p>In late September I got a letter from Immigration about an issue with my
documents. It turned out they needed a copy of my degree, submitted by mail
within two weeks. I had not expected this and it was nearly a problem - my
degrees were at my parents' house in America, and they don't use the Internet,
let alone a scanner. It took a nervous few days but my brother who lives nearby
managed to get the degrees and send me scans of them.</p>
<p>That presented another problem - I had forgotten, but my degree was in Latin.
All documents submitted as part of an application have to be translated into
Japanese, and I don't speak Latin. (Maybe they wouldn't really care about a
degree, but I didn't want to take any chances.) Luckily Brown has <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/http%3A/www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-records/replacement-diplomas/english-tra">an English
translation</a> of their degrees, but that presented another problem - the
text of the degree reads like magical language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TO ALL WHO ARE ABOUT TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, EVERLASTING GREETINGS IN THE LORD.</p>
<p>BE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE AUTHORITY
ENTRUSTED TO HER/HIM BY THE BOARD OF FELLOWS HAS BESTOWED IN PUBLIC ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>AND TO HIM/HER HAS GIVEN TO ENJOY ALL THE PRIVILEGES AND RIGHTS AND HONORS AND
SYMBOLS PERTAINING TO THOSE ADVANCED TO THIS DEGREE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended up writing a sheet explaining the degree was mostly formulaic language
including "appeals to God etc." and just translating the gist of it as "A
Degree in X is bestowed on Y". On the copy of the degree I circled the
important parts ("SCIENTIA COMPUTATORIA" is "Computer Science") and translated
them. I mailed the degree in time.</p>

<p>In late November the small postcard that implies acceptance came, and I took a
day off to go and get my new Residence Card. The process was short and
unremarkable. Since I had spare time and no plans I ended up going by my ward
office to update my My Number Card, deeply confusing the staff with a freshly
issued card not yet reflected in some databases and an unusual procedure, but
that got sorted too. (I did end up having to fill out a Change of Address form
with no Change of Address, but such is paperwork.)</p>
<p>In total it took ten months from application to acceptance, which while long
was less than the year I was quoted. Looking at posts by immigration lawyers
online it looks like the fastest applications around this time took eight
months. I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you recall from <a href="https://able.bio/kerrishotts/building-a-basic-interpreter-80s-style--79a9d703" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">part one of the series</a>, we only really delved into Retroputer BASIC’s first phase of parsing — namely, converting the entered line into uppercase and checking if quotes were properly matched. (Note: it should be mentioned that we could do additional checks there too — like matching parentheses, but we don’t at the moment.)</p>
<p>I also mentioned that I wanted to address how much we take even fairly limited standard libraries for granted today (especially in relationship to JavaScript). Nothing described here is <em>magic</em>, but sometimes we take our tools for granted, and I find it useful to understand what’s going underneath the hood.</p>
<h2 id="tokenizing-user-input">Tokenizing User Input</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the last post, a common tactic used by BASICs of the era was that of tokenization. In order to save space and increase execution speed, keywords were “crunched” into single byte token (or two bytes if you needed more keywords).</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that you have a simple line of code that clears the screen and prints the now common greeting, like the following.</p>
<pre><code>CLS: PRINT "Hello, World"
</code></pre>
<p>While this doesn’t take up a lot of memory on its own, if you write a long program, a lot of the words in that program will be keywords. If we crunched them (tokenized them), we could save a decent amount of space. For example, after tokenizing the line above, you’d see something more like this in memory:</p>
<pre><code>8A E3 B5 FC Hello, World 00 00
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn’t take too much effort to map this back to our original statement:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>
<p>Byte</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Keyword</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Notes</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>8A</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>CLS</p>
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>E3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>“:”</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>End of Statement</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>32</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>“ “</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We store up to one space</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>B5</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>PRINT</p>
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>FB</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>String-in-code</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>String literal follows</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Hello, World, 00</p>
</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>
<p>Strings are NUL-terminated</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>00</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>End Of Line</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Lines are also NUL-terminated</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This may seem like a lot of work, but the space savings can be significant. It’s not a lot <em>here</em>, but even so, you should be able to imagine how it could quickly add up. In this case, our crunched result is 19 bytes. The original text is 26 bytes (counting a terminating NUL).</p>
<p>Saving some space becomes important if you’re a BASIC interpreter running on a machine with very limited RAM. Some BASICs had less than a kilobyte of RAM for user programs, so this crunching was indeed very important, and is something that would have been appealing even if it came with no additional benefits.</p>
<p>OK — so just how do we go about tokenizing something like this? It initially seems fairly trivial in JavaScript. Given an array of strings, you could easily do a quick replace of each keyword with the corresponding token. Right?</p>
<p>Sounds like a job for <code>String#replace</code>, right? Naively, we might try the following:</p>
<pre><code>const tokens = ["CLS", "PRINT", ":" ];
function tokenize (inStr) {
    const newStr = inStr;
    tokens.forEach((token, idx) =&gt; newStr = newStr.replace(
        new RegExp(token, "g"), String.fromCharCode(128+idx)
    );
    return newStr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, it all comes crashing down when you realize that we can’t go about replacing tokens inside of string literals. This means we need to proceed character by character, keeping the context in mind, in order to avoid crunching things that aren’t actually keywords.</p>
<p>This new algorithm much more closely matches that of the assembly language code in Retroputer — but JS still makes things a lot easier. Here’s the start of that JS code (we’ll fill it in throughout the post):</p>
<pre><code>const tokens = ["CLS", "PRINT", ":" ];

function tokenize(inStr) {
    let out = [];                    // return value is "crunched" array
    let idx = 0;                     // index into inStr
    let ch = "";                     // current character
    while (idx &lt; inStr.length) {
        ch = inStr.charCodeAt(idx);  // get the current character code
        
        // our logic is going to go here

        out.push(ch);                // for now push the character
        idx++;                       // and keep going (next char)
    }
    out.push(0);                     // we end with NUL
    return out;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We’re starting with a very simplified token list, as no one wants to see the entire table in this format (<a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/blob/building-a-basic-interpreter-part2/asm/kernel/basic/tokens.js" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">it’s long, and Retroputer actually builds its token tables from a JS file!</a>), but this should be enough for our purposes here. The idea here is that when we see a token, we’ll record its index in an output array.</p>
<p>At this point we have a function that, for now, just converts a string into its equivalent character codes. It doesn’t do much useful at this point, but can serve as useful scaffolding.</p>
<p>Our assembly language version is pretty similar to the above as well.</p>
<pre><code>  do {
    call _get-source-index     # get next character index (in y)
    dl := &lt;BP+source&gt;,y        # read next char from our source string (ch)
    call _adv-source-index     # advance our source index
    call _get-target-index     # get position in target   ("out" in JS)
    &lt;BP+target&gt;,y := dl        # store to target          (out[y] = ch)
    call _adv-target-index     # move it along
    cmp dl, 0                  # was char 0? if so, break
  } while !z
</code></pre>
<p>I’ve not included <code>_get-source-index</code> or the other functions above because they do what they say on the tin, and are simply getting, setting, or advancing our source and target index. One thing of note is that unlike in JS, we don’t have dynamically allocated arrays in assembly language, and so this algorithm pre-allocates a reasonably-sized buffer. As we advance through the input string, we have to know where to write the next token to the target buffer, and that’s what the target index is doing above. Each one of the functions we’re calling above returns the index in <code>Y</code>. For example, The <code>_adv-target-index</code> function advances the target index by one (equivalent to <code>y++</code>).</p>
<h2 id="careful-with-literals">Careful with Literals</h2>
<p>One thing that we should be careful of is that string literals could confuse our tokenizer — we can’t just replace every string of characters that matches a keyword with a token value. If we see a string literal with “CLS” in it, we shouldn’t try to tokenize that. It’s not intended to be executable, and if we print it… well, we’d print the byte corresponding with the token instead. Not likely what the developer wanted.</p>
<p>Number literals, on the other hand, shouldn’t have the same problem since BASIC doesn’t have any numbers as keywords. Even so, there’s zero point in doing a keyword search if we’re looking at a number — why waste time?</p>
<h3 id="tokenizing-string-literals">Tokenizing String Literals</h3>
<p>So, first, let’s check if we’re starting a string — that’s not <em>too</em> hard to do in JS:</p>
<pre><code>if (ch === 34) {
  out.push (0xFB);             // string-in-code token
  idx++;
  ch = inStr.charCodeAt(idx);  // get next character after the quote
  while (ch !== 34 &amp;&amp; idx &lt; inStr.length) {
    out.push(ch);
    idx++;
    ch = inStr.charCodeAt(idx);
  };
  idx++;                       // go past the quote
  out.push(0);                 // end of string
  continue;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A double quote is represented as character code 34. Other programming languages recognize many more quote styles (such as JS or C), but BASIC is simple here: double quotes or bust.</p>
<p>Once we see that we’re starting a string, we can simply consume the remaining characters and add them to our return array until we see another quote.</p>
<p>When we’ve read in the whole string, we need to add a NUL byte, since Retroputer BASIC uses C-style strings. If we wanted to use Pascal-style strings, we could have maintained a counter and made sure to insert the length of the string literal. Not a big deal either way. The only reason I went with NUL-terminated strings is because that’s super easy to deal with in assembly language since we can just compare against the NUL byte instead of maintaining a counter.</p>
<p>Ok, so that JavaScript wasn’t too hard. Most of us, I think, would reach for something a bit more abstract, like a regular expression. It makes the intent a little more obvious, I think.</p>
<pre><code>if (ch === 34) {
  out.push (0xFB);             // string-in-code token
  const stringLiteral = inStr.substr(idx+1).match(/^[^"]*/)[0];
  idx += stringLiteral.length+1;
  out.push(...Array.from(stringLiteral, ch =&gt; ch.charCodeAt(0)));
  idx++;                       // go past the quote
  out.push(0);                 // end of string
  continue;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above does very much the same thing — but instead of us having to do the work of checking character by character, we let JS do it instead with <code>match</code>. We know we’ll get a match (we’re in a string), so we don’t really even need to bother with checking if we get a successful match. Then we just increment our index past the length of the string and copy the characters into our return array. To <em>me</em>, anyway, this is much easier to follow (but does assume you understand regular expressions along with some ES6 syntax like <code>…</code> and arrow functions).</p>
<p>Of course, in assembly language we have to do the work that JS is doing for us. This yields a very similar result to our first JS attempt:</p>
<pre><code>  cmp dl, constants.QUOTE         # is dl a quote?
  brs !Z not-a-string             # nope; not a string

  call _get-target-index          # get next position in crunch target
  dl := brodata.TOK_CODE_STRING   # "String" token
  &lt;bp+target&gt;,y := dl             # Store it into the crunch target
  call _adv-target-index

still-a-string:
  call _get-source-index
  dl := &lt;bp+source&gt;,y             # get string character
  call _adv-source-index
  cmp dl, constants.QUOTE         # if it's a quote, we can zero it
  if Z { 
    dl := 0 
  }
  call _get-target-index
  &lt;bp+target&gt;,y := dl             # write to target
  call _adv-target-index
  cmp dl, 0                       # are we done?
  brs !Z still-a-string           # no, keep going
  continue                        # next!
not-a-string:
</code></pre>
<p>One thing to note about Retroputer’s assembly language parser — it has some very basic support for higher-level constructs, like blocks and loops. So <code>if Z {…}</code> will execute the contents inside the block if the zero flag is set, and <code>continue</code> can be used to branch back to the top of a block (<code>break</code> also works to exit the block). …</p></div></div>

          <p>Have you ever "gone the other way", by which I mean where most people use product A then usually "grow up" or "evolve" and use product B, and you went the other way! B to A. A made up example of B to A would be ridesharing apps -&gt; calling a taxi service on the phone.</p>
<p>In the software world, when you go the other way you notice how all the blog posts, online help is not really helpful at all. They assume you'd only ever go A -&gt; B.</p>
<p>Examples of this I have found are: moving from AWS to Heroku for hosting or from Ledger-CLI to YNAB4 for budgeting. </p>
<p>I'll cover the first of those examples in this article. I will talk about going from AWS to Heroku for the tryjobalerts.com site hosting and data processing.</p>
<h2 id="william-shock-yes-bill-shock">William Shock. Yes... Bill Shock.</h2>
<p>I'm guessing many of you have tried the generous free year of AWS services, and then got your first bill on the 13th month and said "errr. OK". That happened to me and prompted me to cull or move out a load of stuff running in AWS. On the flip side, I was amazed at how cheap SES is - I think my bill was $0.10, and how expensive Elastic Search is, where my bill was $50 for a hardly used cluster. I would have not been suprised to see those numbers reversed.</p>
<p>However before the bill, I had started off moving EC2 servers to Heroku. The reason wasn't cost - Heroku is typically a little more expensive as it provides additional wrapping and services over cloud infrastructre. I moved for the obvious reason that I'm lazy. Which is a codeword for good time prioritisation. I don't want to manage a operating system, server or CI pipeline. Instead I want an expert to take care of that for me for an extra $5 a month. </p>
<p>The point where I switched from EC2 to Heroku wasn't a well thought out logical decision, based on sitting on a leather couch, musing about software architecture. It was an emotional decision based on my node app crashing, and all my services for tryjobalerts.com being out of action for 5 minutes and counting. What if someone tries to edit their settings and they get an error page? how embarassing. Although not that unusual these days, I didn't want to be the one.</p>
<p>What to do next? Well, in the time honoured solution of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8">"turning it off and on again"</a>, I restarted the EC2 instance and BaaM! the node app crashed again. Whatever it did, it took out the machine in such a way I couldn't connect to it via SSH to fix the problem. By this point I rashly decided to move to Heroku. I just didn't have the heart to fix this shit when I wanted to be coding. And I knew this would likely happen again and again, and I'd probably end up on the slow march towards Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Was that a hasty decision? Well maybe it was, but it had been a subconcious thought for quite a while. Setting up nginx, let's encyrpt, PM2 etc. etc. was mildly intersting but feels like a distraction from what I am really trying to do. I am happy for someone else to deal with that, and if everything dies, build them up again. I'll concentrated on the code, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I gave Heroku a try. I thought, let's just see how easy it is. If it "just works" I'll switch over. Otherwise I'm downloading k8s (joking!). I was working on this while the site was out like a light, no one could access their settings, sign up or receive an email - so no pressure.</p>
<p>Moving to Heroku was redicuously easy. I just had to create a file called Procfile with this in it:</p>
<pre><code>web: node distjs/node/index.js
worker: node distjs/bot/index.js</code></pre><p>And set up a few things in the Heroku UI - secrets and such like. I also had to change the port express run on from a fixed port 3001 to the number Heroku provides as an environment variable. Within 15 minutes I say I had it working, sans DNS entries.</p>
<p>I kept SES and PSQL on AWS, and everything worked lovely.</p>
<p>I kept things this way for a few weeks. I then got that bigger than expected bill from AWS, including a fair amount for the PSQL. Nothing too catastophic but it didn't seem like good value for money. </p>
<h2 id="heroku-has-a-weird-limit-for-psql-hobby-basic">Heroku has a weird limit for PSQL Hobby Basic</h2>
<p>I noticed Heroku offers a "Hobby Basic" $9/month PSQL with up to 10M rows. It turns out I use a decent amount of space in TEXT fields, but not too many rows. So I migrated to that. Yes unbelievably I am migrating something from AWS to Heroku to save money.</p>
<p>The limit is weird, being based on number of rows rather than storage size. I wonder how much excellent data you can store as blobs in 10M rows - maybe I should keep quiet as the Heroku Product Owner could be reading.</p>
<p>I searched online for the best way to move the data over. I like Stack Overflow because if someone has had a war story you hear about it instead of experiencing it first hand. However most of the advice online is how to get your data out of Heroku into AWS. Going the other way. </p>
<p>Therefore I tried a couple of ways. It turned out it was easy enough to use psql command line tools <code>pg_dump</code> and <code>pg_restore</code>. It worked first time and took about 30 minutes to do - most of the time was me doing housework while waiting for <code>pg_restore</code> to do it's work.</p>
<p>(Incase it's helpful to anyone, the tip here is don't use the Heroku CLI, get the connection details from the Heroku portal, and use the psql standard tools.)</p>
<p>It is quite amazing to me that Heroku turns out to be cheaper on the PSQL database. It might be because they don't offer as much power as RDS, although they are using AWS in some capacity - perhaps they manage the VM themselves. </p>
<p>It could be that Heroku is happy to lose a bit of money on that Hobby Basic tier, or they more aggressively share resources than AWS does in RDS, so under load it would crack sooner.</p>
<p>Heroku's Hobby Basic PSQL doesn't offer rollbacks, and that could be another reason it's cheap. It means I need to take care of backups myself, however this can be automated quite easily with a periodic dump of the DB.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-too-cheap-though">Don't be too cheap though</h2>
<p>The big mistake I made when moving to Heroku was to try and use the free dynos. Only do this for non-production MVPs. By using the free ones, I had to do a lot of work setting up SSL with Cloudflare, and I never quite got it to work. </p>
<p>I then realised I needed the paid dynos anyway because the free ones cannot be restarted (!) without a deployment. So I upgraded, and then the SSL was sorted. No Cloudflare needed. Had I done that in the first place I'd have saved a couple of hours of frustrating DNS hacking.</p>
<p>It's always a fine line. I mean you try to save money where you can, but sometimes you don't know in advance what the free-tier traps are. Maybe Heroku could make this more obvious, but they did warn that free dynos are mainly for hobby use, so fair enough.</p>
<h2 id="herokus-herokus-£2-a-lb">Herokus! Herokus! £2 a lb!</h2>
<p>I sound like a Heroku salesman at this point. There are other "Platform as a Service" offerings out there. I had just used Heroku before in 2014, and liked that it still existed, so I used that. However there could be better options for you, check them out. Or maybe a regular old cloud like AWS is what you needed all along.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's OK to go the other way, choose whatever makes sense for the project you are doing.</p>

			<h2>–ise or –ize?</h2>
			

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">improve </span>the world, and it may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as
                    etymologically correct and I have not yet found any
                    'authority' that explains how '-
                    <em>ise</em>' can be correct; if any reader knows of
                    one I'd be glad to hear of it and will be happy to
                    quote it below.</p>

                    <p>And do I feel better? Well as a matter of fact, I rather
                    think I do.</p>

                    <p>THE <em>-ize, not -ise,</em> ending
                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns

                    complete noun.</p>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <br>

                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-
                    (cutting), <em>-mis-</em> (putting), and is also used for
                    those nouns which do not terminate in <em>-ism,
                    -ization,</em> etc. Exceptions are
                    aggrandize­ment/aggrandize, recognition/recognize, and
                    others noted in <em>C.O.D.</em> as `assimilated to verbs in

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>B</span>*);
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);
  <span>void</span> (*<span>func2</span>)(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*);
};

<span>// </span><span>Auto-generated default destructor.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_destructor</span>(<span>B</span>* <span>b</span>)
{
  A_destructor((<span>A</span>*)b);
}

<span>int</span> <span>B_func</span>(<span>B</span>*, <span>int</span>) {}

<span>// </span><span>Member function qualifiers are actually qualifiers</span>
<span>// </span><span>of the this pointer.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_func2</span>(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*) {}

<span>// </span><span>Note that the first three members have the same</span>
<span>// </span><span>layout as A_vtable, which means we can safely access</span>
<span>// </span><span>a B_vtable pointer as an A_vtable pointer.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>B_vtable</span> <span>B_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;B_type_info,
  &amp;B_destructor,
  &amp;B_func,
  &amp;B_func2
};

<span>struct</span> <span>class_B</span>
{
  <span>B_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Whenever your code calls a virtual function in <code>A</code>, the compiler looks up the actual function to call through the virtual function table: </p>

                    <p><strong>Knowledge Graphs </strong>are very powerful NLP tools and advanced studies in the field of Knowledge Graphs have created awesome products that are used by milions of people everyday: think of Google, Youtube, Pinterest, they are all very important companies in this field and their knowledge graphs results are spectacular to analyze and use.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565449446922-702749bcaf1b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="A White Library In The Middle Of Stuttgart!

But the thing is, the more spectacular knowledge graphs are, the more difficult they are to build. You actually need more than one way of building a feature like this: think of triples, relationships, integrating with other data sources and so on. </p><p>In this article I'm going to talk about a small subset of knowledge graph relationships: <em>type-of relationships </em>or <em>is-a relationships</em>, meaning we will try to build a small knowledge graph using Python, SpaCy and NLTK. The knowledge graph will tell us if a certain object is a subclass (a type) of another object. </p><blockquote><em>Interested in more? Follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/b_dmarius">@b_dmarius</a> and I'll post there every new article.</em></blockquote><p>As usual on this blog, I will go through a little bit of theory, then code presentation and explanations and in the end results analysis. Feel free to skip to whichever section you feel is relevant for you. Also, all the code for this article i<a href="https://github.com/bdmarius/python-knowledge-graph-semantic-relationships">s uploaded on Github</a> so you can check it out (please make sure to star the repository as it helps me know the code I write is helpful in any way). We will go through all the code anyways.</p><h3 id="article-overview">Article Overview</h3><ul><li>What is Information Extraction</li><li>What is a Knowledge Graph</li><li>Knowledge Graph applications</li><li>Semantic relationships: hypernyms and hyponyms</li><li>Python Knowledge Graph project overview and setup</li><li>Python Knowledge Graph implementation using Python and SpaCy</li><li>Conclusions</li><li>Related articles</li><li>References</li></ul><p><strong>Information Extraction </strong>is one of the most important fields of Natural Language Processing tasks and it consists of techniques of extracting structured information from unstructured text. </p><p>There is a lot of information out there stored in plain text that we as humans are able to understand in a blink, but computers have lots of troubles with this task because they don't understand text, language and context. </p><p>So in information extraction tasks we try to process textual information and transform it in a way that computers are able to understand and use. For this we need to use various NLP tasks like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-building-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-part-1-named-entity-recognition/">Named Entity Recognition</a>: the task of understanding where and how entities such as people, organisations, events and so on are mentioned in a text</li><li>Named Entity Linking: understand how 2 or more entities are related to each other</li><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-part-2-python-keywords-extraction/">Keywords extraction</a>: Extracting the most relevant words from a text. This can be done using <a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/automated-python-keywords-extraction-textrank-vs-rake/">multiple algorithms</a></li><li>Relations extraction using triples</li><li>Knowledge Graphs</li></ul><p>A knowledge graph is a particular representation of data and data relationships which is used to model which entities and concepts are present in a text corpus and how these entities relate to each other. </p><p>The concept of Knowledge Graphs borrows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a>. In this particular representation we store data as:</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graphs---Knowledge-Graph-example.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Knowledge Graph Relationship"><figcaption>Knowledge Graph relationship</figcaption></figure><p>Entity 1 and Entity 2 are called nodes and the Relationship is called an edge. Of course, in a real world knowledge graph there are lots of entities and relationships and there is more than one way to arrive at one entity starting from another. </p><p>Usually these type of graphs are modeled with <strong>triples</strong>, which are sets of three items like (subject, verb, object), with the verb being the relationship between the subject and the object - for example (London, is_capital, England).</p><p>In this article we are focusing on only one particular type of relationship, the "is-a" relationship. If we replace this in the image above we read it as "Entity 1 is a type of Entity 2", meaning Entity 2 is the broader type and Entity 1 is the narrower type - for example (Londin, is_a, City).</p><p>Knowledge Graphs have broad applications, out of which some have not even been succesfully built yet. If you need to better understand your data and the relationships between your data points, a knowledge graph is the way to go. But there are some particulary famous examples of uses of knowledge graphs used in real world use cases:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a> is particulary because they have made this term so popular in the latest years. They use knowledge graphs to enhance search results using some additional information that has been gathered from lots of sources on the internet. They also use it for the Instant Answers feature, where you get an info box answering a question you put in the Google search bar (try for example "Who is the godfather of Harry Potter?"</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/interest-taxonomy-a-knowledge-graph-management-system-for-content-understanding-at-pinterest-a6ae75c203fd">Pinterest is using knowledge graphs</a> to model interests of users on the platform. The Pinterest engineering blog is one of my favourites, feel free to read some of their posts.</li><li>Youtube is also using Knowledge Graph to understand what's behind a video and to recommend the videos to users (thus helping them solve the cold-start problem of their collaborative filtering algorithm).</li></ul><p>So we said we are going to use Python and SpaCy to build a knowledge graph containing "is-a" relationships. But before that (and I promise this is the last introductory section) we need to look into some theoretical aspects. </p><p>In more fancy linguistics terms, "is-a" relationships are named <strong>Hypernymy</strong> and <strong>Hyponymy </strong>relationships. So for example, if we say "Harry Potter is a book character", then "Harry Potter" is the hyponym (the narrow entity) of the relationship, while "book character" is the hypernym (the broad entity) of the relationship. </p><p>And because we are using only plain text to extract such information, we need to look at the structure of the sentences, take a look at what Part Of Speech each word represents and try to figure out relationships from there. That's why we say that we are analyzing <strong>semantic relationships</strong>.</p><p>Now, there are many techniques we can use to extract relationships from text: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised techniques are rule-based techniques. And in this article we are going to take advantage of the fact that English is a well-structured language, so we can go with the rule-based techniques.</p><p>There has been a lot of research in this area but a popular piece of research is done by Marti Hearst [1] the results from this research are popularly known as the Hearst Patterns. She has identified a few patterns that can be used in English to extract hypernyms and hyponyms. In the following table hyponyms are represented by <em>h </em>and hypernyms by <em>H</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Hearst-Patterns.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Hearst Patterns"><figcaption>Hearst Patterns</figcaption></figure><p>We are going to use these patterns to try and figure out is-a relationships from plain text extracted from Wikipedia. It's now time to switch to the real action.</p><p>We are going to extract the text from 4 Wikipedia articles about 2 different subjects: London, Paris, WWI and WWII. We are going to use the Hearst Patterns to extract relationships from these 4 articles and add them to a graph. Then are going to display the graph and analyze of results. First let's install some dependencies.</p><pre><code>pip3 install spacy
pip3 install wikipedia
pip3 install nltk
pip3 install networkx
pip3 install matplotlib</code></pre><p>SpaCy is used for text processing, wikipedia is used for extracting the data. We are using NLTK just for a visualization of the relationships between words in a sentence. Networkx is used for building the graph and matplotlib is used for visualization.</p><p>Another command you should run in your terminal (especially if it's the first time you are using spaCy or if you are using a virtual environment is</p><pre><code>python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm</code></pre><p>This is used to download the spaCy pre-trained model for English that we are going to use in this project. This the the small model and another, larger one is available (en_core_web_lg) but that is not necessary for this project.</p><p>Let's take a quick peek at our project file structure.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Project-file-structure.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Project file structure"><figcaption>Project file structure</figcaption></figure><p>There are quite a lot of file, but we are going to go through each other one by one and I'll provide simple explanations.</p><p>First let's get this out of our way: the <em>utils.py</em> file contains a small utility function that I've added to visualize the structure of a sentence. It uses the NLTK Tree and it is inspired by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39104235">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p><pre><code>from nltk import Tree

def buildTree(token):
    if token.n_lefts + token.n_rights &gt; 0:
        return Tree(token, [buildTree(child) for child in token.children])
    else:
        return buildTree(token)</code></pre><p>We are going to store relations in a <em>Relation </em>object and the code for this class is self-explanatory and located in <em>relation.py</em>.</p><pre><code>class Relation:

    __hypernym: str
    __hyponym: str

    def __init__(self, hypernym, hyponym):
        self.__hypernym = hypernym
        self.__hyponym = hyponym

    def getHypernym(self):
        return self.__hypernym

    def getHyponym(self):
        return self.__hyponym

</code></pre><p>I've also written another class to store all relations. The class is stored in <em>relation_provider.py</em> and, again, it is fairly simple.</p><pre><code>from relation import Relation

class RelationProvider:

    __relations: [Relation]

    def __init__(self, relations=[Relation]):
        self.__relations = relations

    def getRelations(self):
        return self.__relations
</code></pre><p>The first step is to extract the text from Wikipedia. We are using the <em>wikipedia </em>package to get that, and this functionality is found in <em>text_extractor.py</em>. We are first downloading the data and storing it in a local file. To get the text, we are reading that file and returing the entire text.</p><pre><code>import wikipedia


class TextExtractor:

    __pageTitle: str
    __pageId: str

    def __init__(self, pageTitle, pageId):
        self.__pageTitle = pageTitle
        self.__pageId = pageId

    def extract(self):
        page = wikipedia.page(title=self.__pageTitle, pageid=self.__pageId)
        f = open("./text/" + self.__pageTitle + …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For a long time, business software was clunky. Consumer software continued to radically innovate on user experience, staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Palm to iPhone. Styluses to capacitive touch. Taxis to Ubers. Torrents to Netflix. MP3s to Spotify, etc. We’ve lived through this story of how innovation in consumer software radically improved our lives in the last decade.</p>
<p>At one point, business software had no choice but to stop being clunky and terrible to use, because nobody wanted to walk into work to use shitty software. And as teams got more power to pick the software they wanted, business software had no choice but to be simple enough for anyone to try and buy.</p>
<p>If a business application wasn’t easy to use, people just abandoned it and start trialing something else.&nbsp;Apps that had the best user experience started winning more often at work than the ones that didn’t.</p>
<p>Everyone called this trend ‘consumerization of business software/IT’. Dropbox, Google Drive, Docs and Sheets, etc led this era. But despite all efforts by business apps to keep things simple, consumer software continued to set the gold standard in user experience. Business software just followed the direction already set by consumer software products.</p>
<p>However, I think the scene is changing.</p>

<p>Look at Slack. Zoom. Typeform. They’ve gone above and beyond what we’d have expected of business software some years ago. They’re trendsetters in providing delightful user experiences, and they come out far ahead of similar consumer products in this space.</p>
<p>Can you think of another mainstream video calling software that’s as good as Zoom, for consumers? I can’t. About four weeks ago, my friends and I wanted to talk over WhatsApp but the app capped video call participants at 4. The quality of WhatsApp calls isn’t that great either (remember the “Reconnecting…” flashes?).</p>
<p><span> Zoom was top of mind for me because we use it at work every day. We switched to Zoom and everything worked just fine – there were no hiccups during the call, no onboarding problems, nothing at all. Seven people discovered Zoom that day, and all of them loved their first call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know several other folks who are defaulting to Zoom to stay in touch with their friends during this work-from-home season, despite WhatsApp, etc. being a tap away on their phones. That is saying <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> about how ahead of the pack Zoom is when it comes to group video/audio calling. Far ahead of consumer software in this space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m going to unpack what’s happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, <strong>a product that we use at work, nailed the calling experience.</strong> That’s a stark contrast from how sucky business software used to be, a decade ago.</li>
<li>Zoom enjoys <strong>fantastic brand recall</strong> – people spend hours on Zoom meetings every week (if not every day) so it’s on top of our minds when we’re thinking about calling our friends or family (ahead of consumer products that live in our phones.)</li>
<li>WhatsApp, <strong>a consumer product, didn’t impress us</strong> with the one job it was supposed to do (arbitrary limits be damned). Wasn’t consumer software supposed to be the gold standard in terms of user experience?</li>
<li>Seven of us <strong>switched to Zoom instantly</strong> and many of us went back to work to convince our closest teams to start using Zoom (network effects!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Business software like Zoom, etc. are so good that they’re winning against consumer software! If you said that to the person who had to deal with on-premise software and implementations ten or fifteen years ago, they’d certainly not believe it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of products go from consumer to enterprise – Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. launched versions for work after they succeeded in the consumer space. But with us relying on work apps day in and day out and realizing that they’re so delightfully built, we are naturally taking them outside of our work lives and introducing them to our friends and family.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity that I think organizations are slowly realizing they need to chase – Microsoft, for instance, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/30/introducing-new-microsoft-365-personal-family-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just launched</a> personal and family subscriptions for Office 365. Lots of people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already use</a> Asana (and even Slack!) to organize their personal lives.</p>
<p>Even if revenue from consumers doesn’t significantly add to the bottom line for companies like Zoom etc., getting regular users to vouch about your product is definitely going to help take the brand mainstream (think about how well Skype is recognized even today, only because it was available for consumers for so long!).</p>
<p>That’s only going to lead to a cycle of more people discovering these products back at work – helping improve adoption for the business version.</p>
<p>And that’s something nobody will refuse wanting!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3377">

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

<p>My notes from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs520/">CS520 - Knowledge Graph Seminar</a></p>
<h2 id="session-1---what-is-knowledge-graph">Session 1 - What is Knowledge Graph?</h2>
<p><em>Speakers: Denny Vrandečić, Jans Aasman, Mikhail Galkin</em></p>
<p><strong>Denny</strong></p>
<p>Denny speaks about knowledge graphs (KGs) are used for web search, question answer systems, data integration systems.</p>
<p>Specific use case of Wiki Data</p>
<ul>
<li>KG built on 80M nodes, 1B edges</li>
<li>Uses RDF open format (w3c)</li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> annotation</li>
<li>SPARQL for querying</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the open format has great advantages. One example stated was how wikipedia can leverage other services which expose data. Wikipedia can run SPARQL to query OpenStreet Maps data - pick lat, long from OSM for ATMs in Munich for a specific bank network.</p>
<p><strong>Jans</strong></p>
<p>Discussion around modern KGs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic graph DB</li>
<li>Ontologies &amp; Taxonomies</li>
<li>Rule based processing</li>
<li>ML &amp; NLP based processing</li>
</ul>
<p>AllegroGraph's KG implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Document / NLP - Chomsky KG</p>
<p>The Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph will link to over 1,000 articles &amp; over 100 books that Chomsky has authored about linguistics, mass media, politics &amp; war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event Based for Motefiore Health Care</p>
<p>Montefiore’s Patient-centered Analytical Learning Machine (PALM), a machine learning platform built from the ground up to predict &amp; prevent life-threatening medical conditions &amp; minimize wait times.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mikhail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of KG as world models in terms of entities &amp; relations</li>
<li>Encoding can be based on different representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Representations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Symbolic - Logic, DB</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Store as triples</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">Subject-Predicate-Object

Rajakumara starring Puneet

Puneet born Chennai
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vector - NLP, Computer Vision</p>
<ul>
<li>Embeddings - Leverage high dimensional space &amp; a function to group similar things nearby</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>KGs can be viewed from different Point of Views:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Logic programming, RDF way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RDMS - entities are cells, relations are columns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer Vision - CNN + RPN ⇒ graph inference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NLP</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knowledge Graph ⇒ Named Entity Recognition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information Retrieval ⇒ Relation Linking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unstructured Sources ⇒ Question Answer System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language Models</p>
</li>
</ul>

August 8, 2020 | http://kripken.github.io/llvm.js/demo.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://kripken.github.io/llvm.js/demo.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
  This is a demo of compiling and running <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> assembly in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  Press the button to see it compile and run a tiny "hello world" program. You can also try modifying the LLVM assembly and pressing the button again - note though that <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM assembly</a> is typed, so if you add characters to the string for example, you will need to adjust its length, both where it is defined and where it is used (otherwise you will get errors, which will show up in the output area).
</p>



<hr>

<br>

<br>





<hr>
<p>
  This demo works by using parts of the LLVM toolchain (llvm-dis and llvm-as), compiled by <a href="http://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> from C++ to JavaScript, to check the assembly for errors and pretty-print it. Then the emscripten compiler (originally written in JavaScript, but ported from the normal batch/shell mode to the browser environment) is run on the output, and the code executed directly.
</p>
<p>
  This demo was done as a fun hacking project over a holiday vacation, so there are some caveats: The generated code is not optimized at all, so benchmarking is pointless; if you want to benchmark, run emscripten normally with <code>-O2</code>. Compilation speed has also not been optimized at all. Also, this demo has hardly been tested and glues together several codebases in ways they were not originally intended, there might be things that do not work.

It is also one of the poorest, with an annual&nbsp;per capita income of $870 US (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">at purchasing power parity</a>).</p>   <p>"When you are in Malawi and someone asks you, 'Where do you go to church?' and you say you don't pray, it's an awkward thing, like you're a weird person," says Teresa Chirwa, a journalist from Malawi who is spending an academic year at the University of Toronto.</p>   <p>The majority of Malawians belong to one of several Christian denominations (including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and the African Independent Churches),&nbsp;while another 15 to 20 per cent are Muslim. Much of the population also practices traditional African religions.</p>   <p>In recent years, new Pentecostal churches have begun to take hold, and the younger generation has started making its own choices about which churches to attend&nbsp;— rather than following&nbsp; their parents' beliefs, said Chirwa.</p>   <p>"Kids are revolting," she said. "They are leaving the traditional churches and going to the new churches that are emerging."</p>   <p>The country now also has its&nbsp;first atheist organization, although so far, except for its leader, the names of all its members remain secret.</p>   <p>"They're being ridiculed by the society," said Chirwa. "They're being discriminated against for those beliefs."</p>  </div>  <p>Gregory Paul doesn't think it can. After constructing a "Successful Societies Scale" that compared 25 socioeconomic indicators against statistics on religious belief and practice in 17 developed nations, the Baltimore-based paleontologist concluded in a&nbsp;2009 study&nbsp;that "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies."</p>  <p>Paul, who is a freelance researcher not affiliated with any institution, compiled data on everything from homicide rates and income inequality&nbsp;to infant mortality and teenage pregnancies and found that the societies that scored&nbsp;the best&nbsp;on socioeconomic indicators were also the most secular.</p>  <p>"The correlation between religiosity and successful societies is somewhere around 0.7. Zero&nbsp;is no correlation and&nbsp;one is a perfect correlation, so it's a really good correlation, and it's not just an accident," he told CBC News.</p>  <p>"There's no situation where you have a really highly religious nation that's highly successful socially."</p>  <p>Paul's intention in creating the scale was to&nbsp;challenge the idea that religion is universal and innate to the human condition, and to show that societies that don't believe in God are not doomed, as some religious conservatives would have people believe.</p>  <p>"Religion is highly variable, and therefore we need to ask why is it sometimes popular and why it isn't,"&nbsp;Paul said. "One thing we do know is that it's only popular in societies that&nbsp;… have enough rate of dysfunction that people are anxious about their daily lives, so they're looking to the gods for help in their daily lives.</p>  <p>"It's not fear of death that drives people to be religious, and it's not a God gene or a God module in the brain or some sort of connection with the gods; it's basically a psychological coping mechanism."</p>  <h3>Religion on decline in West</h3>  <p>Belief in God and participation in religious services have been on the decline in recent decades in most First World nations but have remained high in developing countries. Between 1947 and 2001, belief in God declined by 33.6 per cent in Sweden, 19.9 per cent in Australia and 7.2 per cent in Canada, according to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Articles/Articles%20published%20in%20journals_files/ppr2006%20norris.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of social science surveys done by Harvard sociologist Pippa Norris and University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart.</p>  <p>Data for&nbsp;developing countries does not go back as far, but recent&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;suggest religiosity has remained high. The 10 most religious countries on the&nbsp;2012 WIN-Gallup International Religiosity and Atheism Index&nbsp;all had 85 per cent or more of respondents identifying as "a religious person," and all were countries with a per capita income&nbsp;of less than &nbsp;$14,100 US.</p>    <p>When Norris and Inglehart&nbsp;pooled 20 years of results from the World Values Survey, which regularly polls dozens of countries on social science questions, they found that in agrarian societies, 44 per cent of people said they attended church at least once a week compared to 25 per cent in industrial and 20 per cent in postindustrial societies. They also found that nations&nbsp;that scored&nbsp;low on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/">Human Development Index</a>, which measures health, education and living standards,&nbsp;tended to be those&nbsp;with the highest rates of participation in religious services and prayer.</p>  <div>   <h2>Religion, faith and belief</h2>   <p>This story launches a CBC News series looking at religion, faith and belief in our world.</p>  </div>  <p>More recent polls have found similar divisions between rich and poor nations. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx">2009 Gallup Inc. religion survey</a>, which sampled about 1,000 people in each of 114 countries, found that among nations with a per capita income of less than $2,000, 95 per cent of respondents, in the median, answered "Yes" to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"</p>  <p>In countries with per capita income of more than $25,000, 47 per cent of respondents answered "Yes." In Canada, 42 per cent of respondents said religion was important.</p>  <p>Bangladesh, Niger, Malawi and Yemen had some of the strongest&nbsp;positive responses (99 per cent) while Sweden (17 per cent), Denmark (19 per cent), Japan (24 per cent) and Estonia (16 per cent)&nbsp;— where religion was suppressed under the former Soviet regime&nbsp;— had some of the weakest.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past the Great Mosque in the ancient desert city of Agadez, Niger.

(a separate entity from WIN-Gallup International).</p>  <p>(The Gallup and the WIN-Gallup International polls have a margin of error of around +/- 3 to 5 per cent.)</p>  <h3>Most vulnerable are often most religious</h3>  <p>Sociologists have argued that the social benefits of religion take on greater importance, the fewer resources and the less&nbsp;control people have over their own lives.</p>    <p>"Religion becomes less central as people's lives become less vulnerable to the constant threat of death, disease and misfortune," Norris and Inglehart write in their 2004 book, <em>Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide</em>.</p>  <div>   <h2>Income gap</h2>   <p>The <a href="http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf">2012 WIN-Gallup International Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism</a>&nbsp;found that in the countries surveyed, respondents in the lowest income bracket were on average 17 per cent more religious than those in the highest.</p>   <p>In Canada, 44 per of those who earn between $20,000 and $29,999 say they practice their religious or spiritual beliefs at least once a week, compared to 32 per cent in the $80,000-$99,999 income bracket, according to the Statistics Canada General Social Survey in 2011.</p>   <p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/114211/alabamians-iranians-common.aspx">Gallup Inc. poll</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. found that the poorest states&nbsp;in the country, such as Mississippi and Alabama, were the most religious and&nbsp;compared with&nbsp;countries like Iran, Lebanon and Zimbabwe in terms of the importance given to religion. Wealthier states like Vermont and Maine were more comparable to Switzerland and Canada, the poll found.</p>  </div>  <p>"As lives gradually become more comfortable and secure, people in more affluent societies usually grow increasingly indifferent to religious values, more skeptical of supernatural beliefs and less willing to become actively engaged in religious institutions."</p>  <p>In poor countries, religious institutions often provide essential services such as education and health care, and the social networks that faith communities provide can be crucial in times of crisis.</p>    <p>"In the richer countries, people are less likely to face existential threats … so they have more opportunity for fulfillment outside of religion," Crabtree said.</p>  <p>But it's more than just an accumulation of wealth that makes a country more secular, sociologists say.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The United States is one of the wealthier societies, and yet, it's still quite religious," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who has studied secularization in Scandinavian countries and wrote a book about it called <em>Society Without God</em>.</p>  <p>"I think it's when you have what we might call 'existential security'&nbsp;— so, wealth and prosperity are part of that, but by that we [also] mean the bulk of people in society have access to housing, health care, jobs. They live in a relatively stable, democratic society without much in the way of existential threats to their lives or their culture."</p>  <p>It's no accident, say some sociologists, that some of the world's least religious people live in nations …</p></span></p></div></div>

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-08: Where do argc and argv come from?</h2>
<p>Continuing on from <a href="https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200803.html">our tiny snake game</a>, let's explore more into how binaries work on Unix. Let's figure out how our programs come to obtain their argc and argv parameters.</p>
<p>You can grab the finished code for this write-up <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo">here on GitHub</a>.
</p><h4>The past: a no option world</h4>
<p>One thing we exploited with our snake game was the fact that it took no options. That was an easy way to keep the binary size down. If the user did happen to write things on the command line after the command invocation, our game would simply ignore it. Such behavior can be explained in the code that invokes the main function.</p>
<pre>main(void)
</pre>
<p>Our main function takes no arguments. But that's not the norm for Unix programs. It is more common that we see our main function take two parameters.</p>
<pre>main(int argc, char *argv[])
</pre>
<p>An integer telling us the number of arguments and a double pointer which gives us those arguments. But how does our program get those arguments? If we type them out on the command line, what is the mechanism that passes things to our program? Let's write a program that takes command line options. It doesn't have to do anything special. Just reading them in and printing them out would work for us. This is effectively the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/echo.1">echo(1)</a> utility we will recreate, though we will leave out the <code>-n</code> flag.</p>
<h4>Setting up our environment</h4>
<p>Let's copy over our <a href="https://github.com/ibara/snakeqr/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s file</a> from SnakeQR. Let's also split it up into three files: the .note.openbsd.ident section will remain in <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s</a>, _start will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_start.s">_start.s</a> file and _syscall will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_syscall.s">_syscall.s</a> file. Let's write a simple <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a> too while we're here. We will put our C code into an <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.c">echo.c</a> file.</p>
<p>We are also going to improve our _start function. As we remember from SnakeQR, the equivalent C for our _start function is</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{

	main();

	_exit(0);
}
</pre>
<p>But we Unix people know that main is an int and can return different values. And we can use those values in other places (like shell scripts). Our current _start function doesn't cut it. We need something more like</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{
	int argc;
	char **argv;

	_exit(main(argc, argv));
}
</pre>
<p>In assembly, that looks something like</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>Really similar to our previous version of _start but this time instead of clearing %edi we instead take the value of %eax after main exits and put it in %edi, which is the parameter for _exit. Why %eax? Because the return value of functions are put in %eax. We have to remember to move the return value to %edi right away because we need %eax again to provide the syscall number as we learned from SnakeQR. You'll notice that we don't handle argc or argv mostly because we don't know yet how to handle them. And maybe we don't have to. With this, we can write a very simple main function that returns the value of argc.</p>
<h4>Is it really that easy?</h4>
<p>Maybe it really is this easy; let's write that simple main function.</p>
<pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

	return argc;
}
</pre>
<p>If we run <code>echo one two three</code> we should get a return value of 4. Remember that the program name ends up counting in argc and lives in argv[0]. Run it, issue echo $? after and... 0. So no, it wasn't that easy. It was worth a shot.</p>
<p>But we know that argc and argv have to come from <i>somewhere</i> and if it's somewhere, chances are good it will show up in gdb. I'll be using <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/devel/gdb">egdb (aka gdb from ports)</a> since that's newer than the gdb in base. We can install it with a simple <code>doas pkg_add gdb</code>.
</p><h4>Running our program in gdb</h4>
<p>If you've never used gdb before, there are a lot of things you can do with it. But let's keep things simple. We can load our program into gdb like so</p>
<pre>$ egdb --args ./echo
</pre>
<p>This will allow us to put any number of command line options, though we're not using any right now. Our argc should be 1 so let's see if we can find a 1 somewhere in gdb.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do in gdb is run the program. At the (gdb) prompt, type <code>r</code> and press Enter.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo
/home/brian/echo/echo
[Inferior 1 (process 38559) exited normally]
</pre>
<p>That wasn't very interesting. It ran and exited without telling us anything.</p>
<h4>Breaking our program</h4>
<p>In order to do anything meaningful we should insert breakpoints. This tells gdb to pause execution at that memory location. All our functions can be used as locations to break. We can also break at offsets from our functions, but we don't need that functionality for today.</p>
<p>We only have two functions so far: _start and main. My hunch tells me that because _start is our entry point, if our hosted environment is giving us argc and argv, it will definitely be findable in _start, whereas we might lose it by the time we get to main. Let's set a breakpoint at _start.</p>
<pre>(gdb) b _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0x201170
</pre>
<p>OK. We're ready to go. Let's run the program now.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000201170 in _start ()
</pre>
<p>We are effectively at the point where our hosted environment hands off execution to the program. Now we can explore our program.</p>
<h4>Getting information</h4>
We can tell gdb to give us the contents of all our registers with the <code>info reg</code> command.
<pre>(gdb) info reg
rax            0x0      0
rbx            0x0      0
rcx            0x0      0
rdx            0x0      0
rsi            0x0      0
rdi            0x0      0
rbp            0x0      0x0
rsp            0x7f7ffffbe6e0   0x7f7ffffbe6e0
r8             0x0      0
r9             0x0      0
r10            0x0      0
r11            0x0      0
r12            0x0      0
r13            0x0      0
r14            0x0      0
r15            0x0      0
rip            0x201170 0x201170 &lt;_start&gt;
eflags         0x202    [ IF ]
cs             0x2b     43
ss             0x23     35
ds             0x23     35
es             0x23     35
fs             0x23     35
gs             0x23     35
</pre>
<p>We know that argc is going to be 1, so any register that is 0 we can ignore. Not what we're looking for. The %rip register holds our instruction pointer, and gdb helpfully tells us that memory location corresponds to the _start function. The eflags register is our status register, which contains information like the carry bit and the zero bit. We can't use that directly. And cs through gs are segment registers, which we are not going to look at today. That leaves us with %rsp as our candidate. It certainly holds something. It happens to be a location on the stack (%rsp = stack pointer). We can examine it with the <code>x/x $rsp</code> command. This is the x command. For us, we will use it in the form x/&lt;length&gt;&lt;format&gt;, where length is the number of format objects we want (if you leave it out, you want one) and format is our format specifier. An x for the format specifier means hexadecimal but there are others too, like f for floating point, i for instruction, and s for string.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffbe6e0: 0x00000001
</pre>
<p>Hey! That's a 1! Let's quit out of gdb and rerun it as <code>egdb --args ./echo one</code> and see if we get a 2 next time.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffcb900: 0x00000002
</pre>
We do!
<h4>Passing argc from our hosted environment to our program</h4>
<p>I think we've discovered that our hosted environment puts argc and argv on the stack and then jumps to _start so that _start also has access to argc and argv. Let's think back to our calling convention: the first argument goes in %rdi. We should be able to pop the top value off the stack and put it in %rdi and then our main function will return argc. Let's add this to _start.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>All we did was add <code>popq %rdi</code> before the main call. Let's recompile and see what happens.</p>
<pre>/home/brian/echo $ ./echo        
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?       
1
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?    
2
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one two
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?        
3
</pre>
<p>I think we can say we are successfully passing argc from our hosted environment to our program.</p>
<h4>Passing argv to our program, part 1</h4>
<p>Now we need to find and pass argv. Maybe it's as simple as the current top of the stack, now that argc has been popped off, is argv. Remember that %rsi is the second parameter according to our calling convention. If it's really that easy all we will need to do is add <code>movq %rsp, %rsi</code> after the <code>popq %rdi</code> we just added.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	movq	%rsp, %rsi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>We should also write a proper echo function in C while we are here. The usual way it goes is skip argv[0], from argv[1] to argv[argc - 1], print the argument and if there is a next argument also print a space. Once we run out of arguments, print a newline. In C, this looks like
</p><pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i;

	for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
		write(1, argv[i], strlen(argv[i]));
		if (i + 1 != argc)
			write(1, " ", 1);
	}
	write(1, "\n", 1);

	return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>strlen</h4>
<p>We don't actually know how long each argument will be, so we need some way to calculate that since our write function requires us to pass the number of characters to write as an argument. The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/strlen.3">strlen(3)</a> function does that for us. But remember since we're building everything ourselves, let's take a moment to think about what strlen does and how we can recreate it.</p>
<p>The strlen function reads in a string and outputs the number of characters in that string. We can set up a second pointer that points to the first character of the string. Since we know strings in C must end with a NUL byte, we can check to see if our second pointer is the NUL byte and if not move to the next character of the string. When we hit the NUL byte, subtracting the original string location from the second string location will give us the length of the string. We can't …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children. By going down these routes, their adherents will delay having kids, likely by years. That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<h2>ImageMagick Examples - Introductory Notes</h2>

<h3>What is ImageMagick?  A No-Holds-Barred Summary</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> is
designed for batch processing of images.  That is, it allow you to combine
image processing operations in a script (shell, DOS, Perl, PHP, etc.) so
the operations can be applied to many images, or as
a sub-system of some other tool, such as a Web application, video
processing tool, panorama generator, etc.  <i>It is not a GUI image
editor</i>. </p><p>

ImageMagick is, first of all, an image-to-image converter. That is what it was
originally designed to do.  That is, it will convert an image in just about
any image format (tell us if it can't) to any other image format.  </p><p>

But it is also a library of <i>image processing algorithms</i>.  These can be
access via the command line and shell/DOS scripts (which these example pages
demonstrate), or via a large number of programming languages, such as C, C++,
Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php">ImageMagick APIs</a>. </p><p>

Speed was never a major feature of IM, which places more emphasis on the
quality of the images it generates.  That is not to say that it can't
transform images in a reasonable amount of time. It's just not blindingly
fast.  Because of this, IM can be slow to perform certain processing
operations, especially when attempting to compress images into image formats
that have limited capabilities. </p><p>

ImageMagick concerns itself mainly with images in the form of a <i>rectangular
array of pixels</i>, commonly called a "raster."  It will handle "vector"
image formats like Postscript or PDF, but at the cost of converting those
images into a raster when loading them, and generating a vector image wrapper
around the raster when saving it.  As a result, vector images are often
processed badly when using the default settings.  However, specific options
can be used to improve this situation.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/formats/#vector">A word about vector image formats</a>.  </p>


<h3>About These Examples of ImageMagick Usage</h3><p>

These pages were developed from, and are a continuation of, my <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/graphics/imagemagick.hints">Collection of ImageMagick Hints and Tips</a> page I first started in 1993,
and placed on the new fangled world-wide-web making its appearance around the
same time.  Information on many aspects of IM, and notes not included in these
pages, are still present in that document.  However, while the present pages
were designed for you to look at, the hints and tips document was only for my
own edification.  So, it may be vague or chaotic in places.  You are welcome
to look at it, learn, and make comments on it.  </p><p>

Other examples were grabbed or developed from answers to users' questions on
he <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">IM
Forums</a>, or contributed to me as solutions to various problems. </p><p>

I look forward to suggestions and e-mail from other IM users.  Such e-mail
generally results in improvements and expansions to these example pages.
</p>

<h3>Command Line Environments</h3><p>

All examples are written for use on UNIX, and specifically GNU/Linux systems,
using BASH scripting.  As a consequence, some examples use shell 'for-do'
loops. Most examples use a backslash '<code>\</code>' at the end of a line to
continue that command on the next line.  The longer commands are broken into
separate lines to try to further highlight the steps being applied. </p><p>

However, you can still use these examples from <b>PC Windows batch
scripts</b>, with some changes to the handling of certain characters.  With
some slight adaptation, the examples can also be run directly from
'<code>system</code>' calls in <b>PHP scripts</b>.  </p><p>

See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/windows/">Windows Usage</a> and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/api/index.html">APIs
and Scripting</a> for more information on using the ImageMagick commands in
these alternative environments. Contributions and test examples are welcome.
</p>


<h3>PerlMagick, and Other APIs</h3><p>

It should also be possible to adapt any of these examples to use the IM API
from languages such as Perl, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, and so on.  I recommend trying
things out on the command line first, until you get them right, and then
converting the operations to the specific API you are using. </p><p>

Although the situation has improved enormously with IM version 6, the command
line really only deals with a single image sequence at any one time. However,
APIs do not have this limitation, and allow you to manipulate multiple image
sequences, separately or together, to perform more complex operations.  This
ability makes it simpler to implement these examples using the IM API, and
removes the need to save images as temporary files, as many of the command
line examples require. When using an API, only permanent and semi-permanent
images need be saved to disk. </p><p>

Basically, let the example pages give you a start, to let you see what
is possible with ImageMagick.  Then, formulate what you want to do on
the command line, before coding the operations in scripts and API
code, where it is harder to make extensive changes. </p><p>

I also recommend that you comment your API code, <b>heavily</b>, adding the
command line equivalents to what you are trying to do, if possible. That way,
you can check and compare the results against those using the command line.
This lets you debug problems that you may come across later, especially as
improvements are made to image processing in the Core ImageMagick Library.
</p>

<h3>Downloading Input Images and Results</h3><p>

As much as possible, I try to use images built-into IM (such as
"<code>logo:</code>" or "<code>rose:</code>") as input images for IM example
commands, or to generate input images using IM commands.  I also often re-use
the output of previous commands in later examples.  Because of this, you
usually don't need to download any 'test' images in order to try out the
examples yourself. </p><p>

However, such generated or built-in images are not always convenient.  So,
when I do use an external image, I tend to re-use that input image, or the
results of previous examples, for later examples in that section. </p><p>

Sometimes the original source image will be displayed or for larger images
a link to the source image is provided. More commonly only the final resulting
image will be shown, as the input is well known or obvious. </p><p>

Almost all the IM example commands shown are executed in the same web
directory in which they appear.  That is, the command you see is the command
that was actually used to generate the image. Because of this you can modify
the page's URL to download or view the input image(s) used by an example.
Extra copies of the external source images have also been placed in the "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/">images</a>" and "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/">img_photos</a>"
sub-directories.  See also the example of a <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/INDEX.html">Fancy Photo Index</a> of those images. </p><p>


If text output or image information is produced by an example, it is saved to
a text file, and an image of it is generated for display on the Web page.
Selecting the text output image will link you to a copy of the actual text
output by the command.  </p><p>

In all these examples, selecting the output image should let you download the
image which was actually created by the example command. But be warned, not
all browsers understand all image formats used. </p>

<h3>External Image Sources</h3><p>

By the way, most of the source images used in these examples come from <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/">Anthony's Icon
Library</a>, particularly the  <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/desc/cl-bgnd/Icons.html">background tiles</a>, <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/large/Icons.html">large
clip-art</a>, and <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/dragons/Icons.html">dragons</a> sections of the library. (I like dragons!).  ASIDE: these pages
may be offline as the web site slowly moves to a new server.  </p><p>

This library actually predates the WWW. I created it in 1991, due to the lack
of good, clean iconic images for use on the X Window System.  The advent of
the WWW has of course changed this, but my original library still exists and
remains available as a source of images, even though it is not actively
growing.  </p><p>

Some specific images, and larger images, are contributed by the authors of
specific examples.  The authors of such examples are listed in the contributed
section, or at the bottom of the page. </p><p>

If you are looking for a specific image, I recommend using <a href="http://images.google.com/imghp">Google Image Search</a> (or similar) to
find something appropriate. You can, of course, convert or resize such images
using IM for your own purposes.  However, you should be careful about
copyright if you plan to use such images commercially. </p>


<h3>PNG Images on Web Pages</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>

In many examples, I use an image in PNG format, such as that shown to the
right of this text.  The PNG image format supports images with
semi-transparent pixels, a feature few other image formats provide.  It is
also a very well-understood image format and, as such, is usable by most of
today's image programs and Web browsers.  </p><p>

Some Web browsers, however, do NOT handle transparent PNG images correctly
(most notably Microsoft Internet Explorer v6).  Because of this, I generally
use the JPEG and GIF formats for images on the Web, and only use the PNG
format when generating images with semi-transparent pixels, or when exact
colors are needed for later examples. </p><p>

To allow IE v6 browsers to display PNG images, I use a special 'style sheet'
using complex JavaScript.  For information on this, see <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/wwwlab/pngtest/">PNG with
transparency for IE</a>. Technically, this is only problem with IE, not
ImageMagick. </p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>

<a name="display"></a>
<h3>Displaying Images on Your Screen</h3>

Display problems can also occur when displaying images on-screen.  Because of
this, I recommend using a command like the following to tile
a '<code>checkerboard</code>' pattern underneath the image, to highlight any
transparent or semi-transparent pixels in it.

<div><pre><code do_not_execute="">
    composite  -compose Dst_Over -tile pattern:checkerboard image.png x:
</code></pre></div>
</td><td>
   <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>

The image displayed in the above example is a special PNG-format <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png">test image</a>, which was generated using the shell
script "<code><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/scripts/generate_test">generate_test</a></code>".
Normally, the command would output the results to your display, not onto a Web
page like this.  </p><p>

If you look carefully, you can see the checkerboard pattern though the
semi-transparent colors. However, the image, as a whole, is fully opaque.  So,
this technique should work on all displays, Web browsers, and image viewers.
</p><p>

As of IM v6.0.2, the "<code>display</code>" program performs something like
this automatically.  However, it does not seem to handle images using color
tables (i.e., GIF) in this way. Using the "<code>x:</code>" output image format
(as above) causes an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Since around 2015, I’ve been <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-pays/">dollar-cost averaging</a>
cryptocurrencies over at Coinbase. “Stacking Sats,” it’s called these days.</p>
<p>Coinbase makes it very straightforward: link your bank account, pick your currency and frequency of purchase, <em>et voila:</em> your USD becomes cryptocurrency. For a fee, of course.</p>
<p>Anybody who has been around Cryptocurrency for more than a couple minutes knows that prices tend to fluctuate wildly.
On the whole, however, prices have been trending up.
As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin is:</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Last 6 months, +194.86%</li>
    <li>Last 2 years, +266.49%</li>
    <li>Last 3 years, +290.18%</li>
    <li>Last 5 years, +5,300.92%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Price information derived from <a href="https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/performance">barchart</a>
  </p>
</div>
<p>With a significant general upward trend like this, monthly cost averaging means you’re leaving a lot of BTC on the table compared with weekly or daily cost average investing.
I decided that daily dollar cost averaging was in my best interest, so I set up a recurring purchase for $10 per day, and ate the $1 service charge. What’s $30/mo when you’ve got compounding double-digit gains on $270/mo?</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra money on the table!
Thinking about this in terms of USD is the wrong approach; the amount of USD I’m spending is fixed.
The correct way to think about this is: how much more BTC would I have if I were not paying Coinbase a 10% fee?</p>
<p>To be clear, Coinbase’s fee is a much smaller percentage if you’re investing a larger sum of money.
Investing a larger sum would mean more time between purchases, which (for reasons described above) I want to avoid.</p>
<p>One solution is to use <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a> instead of <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>.
The <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/fees">trading fees</a> on Coinbase Pro are <em>significantly</em> less — at the volume I’m trading, they’re 0.5% instead of 10%: a whole 9.5% less.</p>
<p>Switching to Coinbase Pro, in other words, earns me 10.5% more BTC per transaction when compared with Coinbase’s “Recurring Buys” offering.
The problem? Coinbase Pro does not offer recurring buys! They <em>do,</em> however, offer an API that we can use to initiate recurring buys on our own.</p>
<h2>Enter Rust</h2>
<p>Call me paranoid, but I am not about to put API keys that can access my personal Coinbase account on servers that I don’t physically control. This means running servers at home, which means electricity costs and heat.</p>
<p>The electricity and heat problems associated with running servers at home can be mitigated by using hardware like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> — a credit-card sized computer that draws around 5W of power, and doesn’t put out enough heat to even require fans. The downsides include limited processing power, and downright atrocious disk IO (if using the built-in SD card reader).</p>
<p>The Pi’s performance limitations mean that I want software running on it to be small and fast.
Furthermore, because I’m dealing with money and network-based APIs, it’s also important that the software I’m using is <em>correct.</em></p>
<p>The Rust Programming Language checks all of these boxes — with performance on par with C and C++, and a compiler that requires you to account for failure cases and not just happy paths, it becomes difficult to write incorrect code.
Furthermore, Rust makes it easy to compile to multiple targets, which means getting it onto an ARM processor (the Pi) is not a significant undertaking.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to Github’s new pricing strategy around Github Actions (free!), we can just let Github compile all the binaries for us! 😁</p>
<h2>The Strategy</h2>
<p>Instead of relying on Coinbase to purchase BTC for us, we’ll write a Rust program to do it instead.
Nothing fancy needed here — no price watching or machine learning to optimize purchase times, just a Rust binary that starts instantly, makes a transaction, logs the output, and exits. Stick it on the crontab and call it good!</p>
<p>The program I ended up with, <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/">hodl</a>, has been running faithfully for the past two months! It’s my first Rust program, so please be kind and help me learn 😊.</p>
<p>Since I began “stacking sats” this way, I’ve only run into one issue: after losing power in a storm, we came back online with a new IP address, and the new address was not yet associated with my API key, so <code>hodl</code> failed to make a couple purchases (this is a security feature that you can elect to disable).
I noticed something was afoot after I stopped receiving my nightly confirmation emails, so I logged onto the Pi, checked the logs, saw the issue, added the new IP address, and we were back in business.</p>
<h2>Setting it up</h2>
<p>Everyone is going to have different API keys, and I’m not about to check mine into the repository :)
In order to use hodl, you need to set some environment variables.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be to create a script, <code>hodl</code>, that sets these and invokes <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/releases">the hodl binary you download</a>:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your key<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_SECRET</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your secret<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_PASSPHRASE</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your passphrase<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>BANK_ID</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>id of your associated bank account<span>]</span>

./hodl-ARMv7 <span>$@</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, you can set your crontab to run periodic deposit and buy commands. For example,</p>
<div data-language="cron"><pre><code># m h  dom mon dow   command
0   0   */3  *   *   /home/pi/hodl deposit 45 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
7   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy BTC 10 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
8   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy ETH 5 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Et voila,</em> cryptocurrency dollar cost averaging at a fraction of the retail cost!</p>
<p>The crontab above will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deposit $45 USD into Coinbase every 3 days (every 72 hours)</li>
<li>Buy $10 USD worth of BTC every day at 7 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Buy $5 USD worth of ETH every day at 8 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Send both standard error and standard output to a log file</li>
</ol>
<p>The times I picked were arbitrary; some time spent with historical data and in a Jupyter notebook revealed that there wasn’t a reliable correlation with time of day and low (relative to a sliding window) prices, so pick a time that’s convenient for you!</p>
<h2>Thoughts on Rust</h2>
<p>Overall, I’ve walked away with a positive impression of Rust.
I especially like the <code>match</code> structure, though it took me a while to get comfortable with the difference between <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types.
Figuring out how to cryptographically sign API request headers to accommodate the Coinbase Pro API was a fun challenge that forced me to get into the docs of other Crates, and (coming from the dynamically typed world of JavaScript and Clojure) suffer a bit of pain for the type system, though I am grateful that it keeps me honest.
I also like the stance Rust takes towards data organization with Structs, which I feel are a much better alternative to the OO purgatory I found myself in back when worked in Java. When it comes to data, though, I still feel like Clojure has it figured out the best.</p>
<p>For this job, Rust was excellent, and I believe in picking the right tool for the job.
Not that other tools wouldn’t have done the job just as nicely, but I was looking for an excuse to learn something, and this solved a real problem that is making me more money as a result.
Just in time, too: since I started using <code>hodl</code> instead of Coinbase, the price of BTC has gone up over 30%!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<h2 id="environment-variables-for-single-page-apps-spas">Environment Variables for Single Page Apps (SPAs)</h2>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Have you ever built a SPA, and found yourself frustrated at having to build specifically for the target environment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“oh dang, this container won’t run in staging because it has localhost:1337 for the back-end API endpoint, whut do?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously you don’t want to pass secrets, but having to build a container per environment for config items is a PITA.</p>
<p>Fear not, answer below.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In the container entrypoint, use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envsubst</a> to push env vars into a template file and serve as a JS file.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables-env-vars">Environment variables (env vars)</h2>
<p>Environment variables are variables which are present in the current environment, duh. For example a container, or a Linux/Windows server, or your local machine.</p>
<p>Once set, they can be read by a program running in that environment. In Go you can do <code>myEnvVar = os.Getenv("MY_ENV_VAR")</code> to read the MY_ENV_VAR env var into a variable in your program.</p>
<p>Docker Compose provides a nice way to pass these from the yaml files which define services:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>my-service:
    environment:
        - MY_ENV_VAR=a-string-value-m9
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When the compose file is used to run the services (containers) it defines, the variable <code>myEnvVar</code> in the Go example would be set to “a-string-value-m9”.</p>
<p>This is really useful, as now the same code can be run, but have things like URLs, DB host names etc. passed in to suit the environment.</p>
<h2 id="when-are-you-going-to-talk-about-spas-though">When are you going to talk about SPAs though?</h2>
<p>I know that the above is most likely familiar, but it gets a bit tricker when you try reading env vars in a statically compiled web app. This is where the docker + envsubst magic comes in.</p>
<p>As a container starts up, a command is run - normally in this context, to run a webserver like Nginx - to serve the static content. At this point we use envsubst to read our template file, squirt in the env vars, and then call the oringinal entry point command - start ya webserver.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-what-you-mean">Show me what you mean…</h2>
<p>From the Dockerfile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>CMD ["sh", "-c", "envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js &gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js &amp;&amp; nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Our config template is read from a non-web-accessible directory above the web root (keep things clean), has the env vars injected by envsubst (<code>envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js</code>), and the result is output (<code>&gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js</code>) into the web root of the static web app.</p>
<p>^^^ that, is the magic!</p>
<h2 id="the-web-bit">The web bit</h2>
<p>The template file I use looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>window.myexampleapp = {
	env: {
		API_URL: "$API_URL",
	},
};
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is simply chucking us a configuration object onto window.</p>
<p>As long as we include env-config.js in our html <code>&lt;script src="/env-config.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> before our application JS, we can be sure that our env vars will be available for use.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>this.apiUrl = window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			? window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			: "http://localhost:1337";
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Read the values in our application as above.</p>
<h2 id="let-us-recap">Let us recap</h2>
<p>So far we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>set the env var (in the docker-compose file, or in a docker run command)</li>
<li>modified container entrypoint to spin up our container with envsubst + run our webserver start command</li>
<li>dropped a file in our container webroot with the env vars injected and added to window</li>
<li>added that file to our html via a script tag</li>
<li>read the env vars from window in our JS</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey presto - your container will now ingest those juicy env vars, and make them accessible to your static front-end application!</p>
<p>One of the huge benefits here is that a single container can be re-used across all environments - giving a higher level of confidence that any testing done has been on that specific piece of built code. Oh, and saving on the number of env specific containers, allowing for easier caching of images for deployments etc.</p>
<p>It also makes for riveting pub chat with your non-technical buddies.</p>
<h2 id="gimme-a-full-example-then-pal">Gimme a full example then pal</h2>
<p>It’ll be up on GitHub soon!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading - technical and other feedback very welcome, hope this is as helpful for you as it has been for me!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>A wise man once told me that inexperienced engineers tend to undervalue simplicity. Since I’m not wise myself, I don’t know whether this is true, but the ideas which show up in many different contexts do seem to be very simple. This post is about two of the most widely used ideas in deep learning, the mean squared error loss and the cross entropy loss, and how in a certain sense they’re the simplest possible approaches.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the mean squared error, which is used when you want to predict a continuous value. If the model’s prediction was <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png" alt="x"> and the correct answer was <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f.png" alt="y">,</nobr> then the mean squared error is defined as:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9.png" alt="\text{MSE}(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2"></p><p>We can observe some basic facts about the mean squared error. It’s differentiable, so we can find its derivative with respect to <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png" alt="x">,</nobr> which lets us optimize the model parameters to minimize <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f.png" alt="\text{MSE}(x, y)"> using backpropagation. And it’s zero if and only if <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce.png" alt="x = y">,</nobr> so a model which successfully minimizes it has learned to produce the correct answer.</p>
<p>But these facts don’t fully explain why people use mean squared error, since there are many other functions which also satisfy both properties. For example, <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2.png" alt="(x - y)^4"> and <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc.png" alt="\sin^2(x-y)"> <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a.png" alt="+"> <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d.png" alt="\sin^2(\pi(x-y))">.</nobr></p>
<p>Instead, we should look at the derivative, which is beautifully simple:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d.png" alt="\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \text{MSE}(x, y) = x - y"></p><p>Neither of the alternative functions mentioned above has such a simple derivative. The only function that comes close is <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3.png" alt="|x-y|">,</nobr> whose derivative is <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750.png" alt="\text{sgn}(x-y)">,</nobr> but most people would agree that a linear function is simpler than <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617.png" alt="\text{sgn}">,</nobr> which is nonlinear.</p>
<p>So, in plain English, the mean squared error is the loss function you get if you decide that your error signal should be equal to the difference between the output you wanted and the output your model gave. This explains why we should use it: why use anything more complicated if it’s not necessary?</p>
<h2 id="the-cross-entropy">The cross entropy</h2>
<p>It turns out that a very similar argument can be used to justify the cross entropy loss. I tried to search for this argument and couldn’t find it anywhere, although it’s straightforward enough that it’s unlikely to be original.</p>
<p>The cross entropy is used when you want to predict a discrete value. To define it, we’ll need to change our framework to make the model output a probability distribution <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png" alt="q"> instead of a scalar. The desired output will also be a distribution <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">.</nobr> We’ll represent our probability distributions as non-negative vectors of <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png" alt="N"> elements which add to 1. <nobr>(<img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png" alt="N"></nobr> is the number of distinct values that our prediction target can take.)</p>
<p>The cross entropy is defined as:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/aa99dd99c0.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/aa99dd99c0-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/aa99dd99c0.png" alt="H(p, q) = \sum_{i=1}^N -p_i \log q_i"></p><p>Just like the mean squared error, the cross entropy is differentiable, and it’s minimized if and only if <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/ed42bcf6f1.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/ed42bcf6f1-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/ed42bcf6f1.png" alt="p = q">.</nobr> It’s also linear in <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">,</nobr> which lets us use the following trick to estimate its gradient using only a sample from <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p"> instead of <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p"> itself (where <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e1caa65746.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/e1caa65746-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e1caa65746.png" alt="\theta_k"> is a model parameter):</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/193c66ad8e.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/193c66ad8e-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/193c66ad8e.png" alt="\begin{align*} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_k} H(p, q) &amp;= \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_k} \mathbb{E}_{i \sim p} [-\log q_i] \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{i \sim p} \left[\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_k} (-\log q_i) \right] \end{align*}"></p><p>This is essential for practical use because you don’t typically know the true distribution of labels <nobr>(<img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">).</nobr> Instead, you have a single label representing a sample from that distribution <nobr>(<img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/989092a634.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/989092a634-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/989092a634.png" alt="i\sim p">),</nobr> and you need to use it to estimate the gradient.</p>
<p>But even with the new constraint that the loss function should be linear in <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">,</nobr> there are still many alternative functions which satisfy all these properties. In fact, Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Examples_of_proper_scoring_rules">a list of them</a>.</p>
<p>So what sets cross entropy apart? To answer this question, let’s make an additional assumption about our model: we assume it produces logits <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png" alt="\ell"> and that its prediction <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png" alt="q"> is obtained from <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png" alt="\ell"> using the softmax function:</p>

    <!--INTRO START-->
    <p>Tor is a fantastic networking and privacy technology that makes private and anonymous browsing available to millions. Despite this, it is unfortunately seen by some people as a system that solely exists to facilitate an illegal criminal underground, </p>
    <p>However, to take a literal view, <i>Tor is just a networking tool</i>, and it can be used in any way that you want. The features that enable privacy and anonymity are also extremely useful for many of the tasks carried out by Network Engineers and Systems Administrators on a daily basis. For example:</p>

            <h3><u>Warning:</u></h3>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>The techniques described within this article should only be used in environments where you are permitted to do so.</p>
            <p>Please ensure that you comply with all local policies regarding the usage of Tor, including from your employer, customer/client, or other relevant entities.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="testing-ip-address-based-access-rules">Testing IP Address Based Access Rules</h2>
    <p>In some network environments, IP address based access rules are used to either restrict or allow access to a service, or are used as a decision factor in a conditional access policy. For example, a common use-case is removing the requirement for two-factor authentication upon login if you are connecting from a trusted IP address, or requiring additional verification steps when connecting for the first time from a new location.</p>
    <p>However, it is usually quite difficult to fully test such policies without access to multiple unique devices and/or VPNs.</p>
    <p>Using Tor and the Tor Browser, you can test your access rules from multiple arbitrary external IP addresses. You can also very easily reset your browser profile or establish a new Tor circuit at any time, allowing you to very easily create a new 'identity' for testing, without the risk of previous tests impacting the results.</p>
    <p>If you want to test something that isn't a web-based service, you can use the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper to force the network connections of any program to be routed over Tor. For example, to test an IP address based SSH access rule, you could route an SSH connection over Tor to make it originate from a new/unknown IP address:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks ssh <span>jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>Unfortunately <code>torsocks</code> cannot be used with setuid programs such as <code>ping</code>, nor can it be used with programs that exclusively use UDP.</p>

    <h2 id="testing-internally-hosted-services-from-an-external-perspective">Testing Internally-Hosted Services From an External Perspective</h2>
    <p>If you are hosting certain network services internally/on-site, e.g. web servers or mail servers, it can often be a challenge to properly test these from an external/public-facing perspective.</p>
    <p>It's very important that this testing is carried out, as network services will often have differing configurations or policies depending on where you are connecting from. The lack of an easy way to perform this testing internally often leads to crude solutions involving personal devices or mobile data tethering, which are neither convenient or reliable.</p>
    <p>However, similarly to how IP address based access rules can be tested with Tor, you can also use Tor to access your internally-hosted services from an external perspective. This will allow you to carry out all required testing from your standard device.</p>
    <p>For example, you can use <code>torsocks</code> with cURL:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks curl <span>https://www.jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>Alternatively, if you don't want to use the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper, you can point cURL to the local SOCKS5 proxy directly, which runs on <code>127.0.0.1:9050</code>:</p>
    <pre>$ curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 <span>https://www.jamieweb.net</span></pre>

    <h2 id="making-reliable-external-dns-lookups-when-operating-in-a-split-horizon-dns-environment">Making Reliable External DNS Lookups When Operating in a Split-Horizon DNS Environment</h2>
    <p>Most corporate networks operate a 'split-horizon' or 'split-brain' DNS setup, which is where a separate internally-hosted DNS server and associated zone is used to serve DNS requests that originate internally. The internal DNS server will often respond with 'internal' addresses, i.e. private or RFC1918 addresses, rather than 'external' public-facing addresses.</p>
    <p>This is usually used in combination with a configured search domain or DNS scope, in order to allow internal services to be accessed via their direct hostname, without requiring the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).</p>
    <p>However, these split-horizon DNS setups can often pose a problem when you explicitly need a request to go to an external DNS server. Some networks will forcefully route <i>all</i> DNS traffic to the internal DNS server, and others will even intercept and rewrite DNS responses at the network edge, e.g. using the DNS doctoring or DNS NAT rewriting features that are present in many commercial edge firewall products.</p>
    <p>You can usually get around these issues by forcing your external DNS lookups to take place over TCP, i.e. using the <code>+tcp</code> option in DiG (also known as 'virtual circuit' mode), but this isn't always supported or available.</p>
    <p>By routing your external DNS lookup over Tor, you can know for certain that the response hasn't been tampered with during the 'last mile' as it passes through your network edge:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks dig +tcp @1.1.1.1 <span>jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>You'll need to use <code>+tcp</code> mode, as well as ensure that the request will be routed directly to the external DNS server, and not through a local caching resolver such as <code>dnsmasq</code>. This is because the Tor daemon will block requests to access local addresses such as <code>127.0.0.1</code>. If you do accidentally attempt to access a local address, Tor will display the following error:</p>
    <pre>WARNING torsocks[]: [connect] Connection to a local address are denied since it might be a TCP DNS query to a local DNS server. Rejecting it for safety reasons. (in tsocks_connect() at connect.c:192)</pre>

    <h2 id="bypassing-blocked-outbound-ports">Bypassing Blocked Outbound Ports</h2>
    <p>In many corporate network environments, permitted outbound ports are limited in order to help ensure that all outbound traffic is tightly controlled, e.g. for the purposes of Data Loss Prevention (DLP).</p>
    <p>However, for people in technical roles, this can pose quite a challenge, as various legitimate services will inadvertently be blocked too, and exceptions can be difficult to implement on a per-user basis.</p>
    <p>A common one that is often overlooked is the WHOIS protocol, which operates on TCP port 43.</p>
    <p>Using the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper, you can route these requests through Tor in order to get around the blocked outbound port:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks whois jamieweb.net</pre>
    <p>In some cases, firewalls performing Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) can also prevent certain connections to otherwise allowed ports. For example, a sysadmin using <code>openssl s_client</code> to retrieve a certificate from a web server may have their request blocked, as they aren't establishing a full HTTPS connection.</p>
    <p>However, by routing the request through Tor, the connection can be made successfully:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks openssl s_client -connect jamieweb.net:443</pre>

    <h2 id="exposing-services-when-behind-nat-or-cgnat">Exposing Services When Behind NAT or CGNAT</h2>
    <p>There may be cases where you need to expose a locally running service to the internet, e.g. SSH or a web server. Unfortunately, this is often non-trivial due to NAT, and especially CGNAT (carrier-grade NAT).</p>
    <p>One particular use case that I've worked on is accessing a 4G-connected device remotely using SSH. Because the majority of consumer data plans operate using CGNAT, you cannot just bind the service to your perceived public address and have it work, as there will potentially be hundreds of other customers sharing that same IP address. Multiple layers of NAT are often used too, which of course complicates things.</p>
    <p>However, you can use Tor to expose your service via a Hidden Service, also known as a <code>.onion</code> site. This way, your service will be easily accessible over Tor no matter how many layers of NAT or filtering you are behind.</p>
    <p>This can be achieved by adding a few lines to your <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> configuration file:</p>
    <pre>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/<span>my_service</span>
HiddenServicePort <span>22 127.0.0.1:22</span></pre>
    <p>The <code>HiddenServiceDir</code> configuration specifies where your Hidden Service public/private keys will be stored. This should be an arbitrary directory in <code>/var/lib/tor/</code>. You should not create this yourself, as the Tor daemon will create it for you using the correct permissions.</p>
    <p>The <code>HiddenServicePort</code> option is used to specify where incoming requests to a specific port will be forwarded to. In this case, requests to the Hidden Service on port <code>22</code> will be forwarded verbatim to <code>127.0.0.1:22</code>.</p>
    <p>You can also optionally configure your Hidden Service in single-hop mode, which will allow it to connect to the Tor network using a single hop, rather than the usual three, potentially improving performance. <b>This will completely de-anonymise your Hidden Service, so <u>DO NOT</u> use single-hop mode if your own anonymity is important.</b> In most legitimate sysadmin use cases, single-hop mode is perfectly safe and acceptable.</p>
    <p>You can enable single-hop mode by adding the following to your Hidden Service configuration:</p>
    <pre>HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1</pre>
    <p>However, running in single-hop mode will prevent your Tor daemon being used as a client, as your connection to the Tor network is not anonymised. If a SOCKS port is configured in your <code>torrc</code> file, you'll also need to disable this:</p>
    <pre>SocksPort 0</pre>
    <p>Once you've finalised your Hidden Service configuration, save the <code>torrc</code> file and restart the Tor daemon:</p>
    <pre>sudo service tor restart</pre>
    <p>You can now view the <code>/var/lib/tor/my_service/hostname</code> file in order to identify the <code>.onion</code> address for your Hidden Service. This can be used from any other …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In the past decade, we've seen an explosion of innovation in AI and machine learning. However, coding itself was barely touched by AI. The most significant example of AI-powered coding tools is editor autocomplete extensions like Kite or Tabnine. </p>
<p>At Repl.it, we believe this is about to change. With the advent of natural language models like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT</a>, for the first time, we're seeing an ML model that performs shockingly well on all sorts of language-related tasks including coding.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to and excited by the applications of natural language models in coding when I read the 2012 paper <a href="https://amasad.me/public/natural.pdf">"On the Naturalness of Software,"</a> which leveraged an incredibly simple NLP technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-gram</a> to build an autocomplete engine that rivaled industry standards. </p>
<p>GPT-3, the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">newest model from OpenAI</a>, is a multiple order of magnitude in power, making it feel closer to magic. We got access to the new model, which still in beta, and we quickly got to work building coding tools:</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Reading code is hard! Don't you wish you could just ask the code what it does? To describe its functions, its types.</p><p>And maybe... how can it be improved?</p><p>Introducing: <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Replit</a> code oracle 🧙‍♀️</p><p>It's crazy, just got access to <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OpenAI</a> API and I already have a working product! <a href="https://t.co/HX4MyH9yjm">pic.twitter.com/HX4MyH9yjm</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285789362647478272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>In this example, what we're seeing is an AI assistant who can answer questions related to coding, which we believe is a first of its kind. You can ask all sorts of questions. High-level questions like "What does this code do?" to questions about the program's details, like "what's the type of x?."</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking and thrilling that it can also give you ideas on extending the project and where to take it. </p>
<p>To make it clear that this wasn't trained on some small subset of types of projects, we took a random project from our community and ran it on it as well:</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just to prove that it works on totally novel code, here is a recent project from our community: <a href="https://t.co/oA15YOZtFw">https://t.co/oA15YOZtFw</a></p><p>- It described it!<br>- Told me how to improve it!<br>- Told me where to post it after I improved it!</p><p>It's an awesome tool to make learning programming fun! <a href="https://t.co/Fnkd69DgXU">pic.twitter.com/Fnkd69DgXU</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285797739930869761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>Now, this is pretty mindblowing. But we also wanted to do something more concretely useful. We thought, what if the AI could fix simple syntax errors. The kind that newbies tend to run into and sometimes get stuck. </p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you've ever taught programming you know that newbies make simple mistakes like mixing between strings and variables, not closing parenthesis or quotes, etc.</p><p>Many then get stuck and quit learning programming.</p><p>Working on a code fixer for <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> to fix this problem: <a href="https://t.co/DUxMAPGQfV">pic.twitter.com/DUxMAPGQfV</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285997706884706304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>These are just the tip of the iceberg we're hacking on many more ideas. But just to give you an idea of what's possible, here is a demo where GPT-3 is used to generate React.js components: </p>
<blockquote>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284807152603820032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<h2 id="ai-and-the-future-of-coding">AI and the future of coding</h2>
<p>So what does this mean for programming? Does it mean that there is no point in learning programming because it will get fully automated? </p>
<p>We don't believe so. Here is what we think the impact will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI-assisted coding will remove the drudgery out of coding. We'll have tools that help us code faster. We'll see more sophisticated code generation and refactor tools, and repetitive coding tasks -- the moments you see yourself copy-pasting code -- might get automated away wholly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>AI will make it easier to learn programming (and many other things). Imagine Codecademy-like courses entirely guided by AI with conversational abilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eventually, AI will influence how we design programming languages, and a new class of languages will emerge. Since computers will be better and faster than humans at generating code, the act of programming itself might change. Who knows, we might be able to program by talking or even by moving in VR/AR. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point -- probably not in the near future -- the word "coding" will disappear from our lexicon because programming will stop requiring code and instead be about the pure act of solving problems using computers making it accessible to more and more people. </p>
<p>In the meantime, if you haven't yet, you should still learn how to code and get good at it. It's unlikely that things will change meaningfully in the short-term, and coding is still the best way to program computers. But keep your eyes open to the future, and we'll do our best at Repl.it to build the most advanced programming environment regardless of the modality. </p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>In addition to GPT-3 we're also experimenting with more ways to bring AI into coding. In the following example, Sergei Chestakov, an engineer at Repl.it built an app that lets you execute hand-written code!</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm building an app that let's you take a picture of handwritten code and execute it: <a href="https://t.co/4s4Pvychqf">pic.twitter.com/4s4Pvychqf</a></p>— Sergei (@SergeiChestakov) <a href="https://twitter.com/SergeiChestakov/status/1289726580210561025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>We're <a href="https://repl.it/@util/jerbs#open-positions/ai.txt">hiring AI engineers</a> to bring AI into coding. If this is something you're passionate about we'd love to talk to you!</p>

                    <p>TikTok utilizes Artificial Intelligence to elevate content to various users, and enables content makers to make recordings with music, filters and other improvements. If you are looking for extreme entertainment, but you don't like to spend hours on your smartphone, TikTok is the answer. If you like short dance videos, lip-syncs, comedy, parody, or other talent videos, TikTok offers a one-stop solution. There will not be any online user who does not know about Tiktok.</p><p>Tiktok is built in 2016 by <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/">ByteDance</a>, a Chinese internet technology company. After a successful merger with Musical.ly, Tiktok was finally launched for the United States on August 2, 2018. TikTok has become the most downloaded app in 2018 and 2019. </p><h3 id="what-made-tiktok-the-highest-downloaded-mobile-app">What Made TikTok the Highest downloaded mobile App?</h3><p>Some people count the number of downloads to rank the most rated app. For this, TikTok yet stays the giant with more than 2 billion app downloads globally. Tiktok stands at 4<sup>th</sup> position with 800 million active users. Facebook, Messenger, and Whatsapp hold the top position in social media app ranking. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Wq3n5IFQHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>What makes TikTok so popular?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the content published in TikTok is fantastic and addictive. But we cannot disregard the algorithm behind this app that keeps the user flooded with the videos of interest. This article is solely confined to the backend artificial intelligence programs that made TikTok user-friendly and more interactive. This discussion includes critical features and their respective AI programs for TikTok.</p><h3 id="how-is-tiktok-different-from-other-apps-the-recommendation-engine-">How is TikTok Different from other Apps? The Recommendation Engine!</h3><p>Recommendation engines are <strong>data filtering tools</strong> that work on the interest of a particular user. For this purpose, they use algorithms and searched data and then mention it as a recommendation in the sidebar of a particular platform. You can compare them with a ‘’shopkeeper guy.’’ When you ask him for a specific item, he also shows you some other products. At the same time, these products are based on the interest you have shown previously. With the rising number of data finders on search engines, the amount of data providers also raised. Moreover, particular platforms also use recommendation engines to keep the user on their site for a long time.</p><p>There must be a reliable data basis that collects and stores information and show it in real-time. It will then favor a variety of abstract layers like algorithm, serving, and application layers to appear on the front. Ultimately, it resolves many business person’s issues. </p><p>Typically, there are two standpoints for TikTok; the one represents the creator side while the other covers the consumer's side.</p><h3 id="1-content-creator">1- &nbsp;Content Creator</h3><p>TikTok supports content producers with AI to create viral content. Its robust AI system suggests the producers about keywords, hashtags, video editing, and attractive music selection. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="2-consumer-side">2- &nbsp;Consumer Side</h3><p>TikTok’s efficient algorithm notices the likes and comments of the users. It also focuses on their retention time on a particular video and then offers them the video of their interest. <strong> &nbsp;</strong></p><h3 id="what-will-appear-first-in-a-new-tiktok-user-s-feed">What will Appear First in a New TikTok User’s Feed? &nbsp;</h3><p>TikTok lowers inconvenience by not forcing the audience to sign-up first. It gets information about your taste by the first video you watch and the time you spent on it. The original content that appears in your TikTok feed is based on the data you provide during signing-up on the app. TikTok’s archetype traces your location, age, and gender to show you the content that matches the above-provided information. After it, TikTok will show you data related to your first search on the engine. </p><p>The primary purpose of every app is to engage the audience for a longer time by reducing the exit rate. TikTok efficiently shows you the most loved video by the audience in your location. After getting enough information about your interest, it will trace your metrics and offer a final score.</p><p>If you click on a celebrity video, it will add it to your favorites. Then next time when you come on the app, you’ll see related videos on top as a recommendation. Further, it analyses your curiosity to favor you with precise recommendations. &nbsp;</p><p>There are several theories related to TikTok’s algorithms. The user experience and expert analysis make their basis. </p><h3 id="batch-theory">Batch Theory</h3><p>When a user uploads a video, it undergoes through different batch pools to distinguish its content from others. In this scenario, the algorithm traces its watching history, personal preferences, location. Your content becomes famous if it gets more likes, sharing, and comments than usual. So, the algorithm assigns a score to your content based on the points mentioned above.</p><p>Finally, if the algorithm finds your content impressive, then it exposes your unique content to a big audience. According to this theory, it will take a week or more to become a celebrity. It also includes that engage more audience in trending topics to get more promotions. </p><h3 id="delay-momentum">Delay Momentum</h3><p>This theory suggests the data uploaders not to delete their content; it doesn't matter how rough it is. Some users also share their experience that some pieces of their content were not so appealing. They started using the app less than before, and they eventually saw a rise in their audience. In this way, TikTok cares about its users and feel them they are essential to its community. The TikTokers get passion and start producing new content to retain the audience. </p><p>This theory suggests that the success of your account to be viral is only depends on your introductory videos. If you succeed in gaining some likes and views, then TikTok’s AI considers you a perfect match. Now the algorithm provided you the audience, and you, in return, have to sustain it with fantastic content.</p><p>Three primary pillars help TikTok archetypes are:</p><ul><li>Tagging the content</li><li>Producing user-profiles and user scenarios and</li><li>Training and helping recommendation algorithms.</li></ul><p>Here is a detailed conversation about them.</p><h3 id="data-and-features">Data and Features</h3><p>Firstly., we consider what data is? Recommendation model comes with the user's fulfillment by providing the User Generated Content. For this information, input data comes from three-dimension.</p><p><strong><em>Content Data</em></strong><br>TikTok is widely in use over the world; thus, it also has a variety of information. Every type of content has a unique taste and should be in different categories. So, the system should be strong enough to show specific data in a specific recommendation. </p><p><strong><em>User Data</em> </strong><br>This data includes the user's personal information like age, gender, career, and demographics. It also adds some hidden features form ML-based customer clustering.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario Data</em></strong><br>As its name shows, it tracks user's preference shifts and uses scenarios on variable scenarios. For instance, what kind of video a user loves to watch while traveling, working, jogging, and many more.</p><p>Once the data collection is done successfully, then the four critically planned features are introduced into the recommendation engine. </p><h3 id="correlation-features">Correlation Features</h3><p>They correlate the content characteristics with user tags, containing keywords, theme tag, source matching, and arrangement tag. Moreover, they also represent latent features like vector separation between content and the user.</p><p><strong><em>User-Scenario Features</em></strong><br>These tags monitor scenario data like physical location time, and date of content uploaded with event tags. </p><p><strong><em>Trend Features</em> </strong><br>They represent a worldwide trend that becomes a hot topic in a specific time. However, they also denote top keywords, trending themes, and user interaction with them.</p><p><strong><em>Collaborative Features</em></strong><br>These features work based on a collaborating filtering strategy. It equilibrates the bias recommendation (narrow) and generalized recommendation (collaborative). Furthermore, this feature not only records data of an individual but also a group of related people with the same interests. It also traces their interests, impression click-through rate, themes, and keywords. In this way, the above-discussed features decide what to show in a particular scenario to a particular user. </p><h3 id="tiktok-recommendation-system">TikTok Recommendation System</h3><p>After video uploading, the robust algorithm uses a highly-efficient NLP and computer vision system for video analysis. Just like humans, it read every part of your video, including audio, video images, captions, and hashtags. Then it assigns it a specific category according to the content and context of the material. </p><p>The working strategy of TikTok will shock you. It exposes every new coming data to a small audience and evaluates your hard work based on the viewer's interest. After all, it will decide a score for your video as:</p><table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Watch-again rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>10 Points</p>
</td>

<p>Retention time</p>

<p>2 Points</p>

</tbody>
</table><p>Moreover, its robust AI system also distinguishes between looping and non-looping videos. Looping content doesn't help to make you viral. If your video catches the high score, it means your video is in the right list of TikTok’s algorithm. It will share your video with the right audience having the same head and heart. &nbsp;</p><p>Your video doesn’t go viral if it's unable to get the rank, as mentioned above. But still don’t lose heart, Delay Momentum Theory works here. Now you are well familiar with how TikTok retains the audience for more significant periods. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="intangible-goals">Intangible Goals</h3><p>In the recommendation model, all objectives, including clicks, likes, dislikes, comments, re-posts, and reading time, are assess-able. The algorithms use this information rightly and then show it as a prediction precisely. But there are some other imperceptible objectives; for them, the recommendation engine can’t provide quantifiable information. </p><p>For the maintenance of a healthy and user-friendly environment, TikTok is going to overpower all violent content. The platform is deciding to remove all content related to pornography, scamming, pomposity, and even political news.

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">

<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-compactness">

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>
</div>
<div id="null-a-bag-of-surprises">

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1
---------

       1
(2 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>or <code>UN…</code></p></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>Explorer is a power tool for GPT-3 experimentation with <strong>full history</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and the community’s <strong>best-practices</strong> built-in. If you’re just getting started with GPT-3 or don’t want to build out your own boilerplate codebase, try the hosted version: <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">Explorer</a>. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-ui-for-experimentation">A UI for experimentation</h2>

<p>To get good results from GPT-3, you need to experiment. (Despite what the cherry-picked examples on Twitter will have you believe!)</p>

<p>This fundamental insight led to Explorer’s first feature: saved history. They say the difference between tinkering and science is rigor and reproducibility. We codified that transition by making all our prompts and settings automatically saved and shareable. Annotations further allowed us to build and improve upon previous results.</p>

<p>Long term, we envision an environment that enables the development of higher level APIs on top of GPT-3. A system for designing pipelines of prompts, complex scripts, logic to retrieve external information — that can all be published for use in products and research.</p>

<p>Building complex applications requires you to work at a higher level of abstraction than machine code. <strong>How can we build an open source operating system for GPT-3 at the dawn of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>?</strong></p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved!</h2>

<p>There’s a long road ahead and we’re thankful for all of your feedback and suggestions so far. We welcome code contributions to Explorer - pop over to <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">the repository</a> to learn how you can get it running locally!</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="building-together">Building together</h3>

<p>The community is continually discovering incredible methods for unlocking GPT-3’s potential. Without the right set of tools, most practitioners struggle to find and implement these new techniques.</p>

<p>That’s where we see the need for an open source project where we can all rapidly experiment and codify what we’ve learned. Here are some of the community’s methods and best practices that we’re excited to incorporate as features in Explorer:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This method skirts the token limit by “chaining” together prompts and their outputs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:chaining">Chaining</a> breaks down larger tasks into component sub-tasks, before composing them back together in a single prompt to get your final result.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context stuffing</strong></p>

<p>This is a method of iterative prompt improvement that involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running an initial prompt</li>
  <li>Cherrypicking the best GPT-3 outputs,</li>
  <li>Appending them to the original prompt, to provide more examples for GPT-3 to use.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h3>

<p>In the coming months, with your help, we plan to build these features (and more!). As the private beta comes to an end, let’s enable new GPT-3 users to hit the ground running with the cumulative, collective insights of the community.</p>

<p>As we receive feedback and contributions from the community, this roadmap will continue to change and be reprioritized. You can follow a live version of it <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and importing prompts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“GitHub for Prompts”. Let’s make it easy to share and build on each others’ work!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt evaluation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GPT’s performance is very, very sensitive to prompt design. So iterating on prompt design is our highest priority.</li>
  <li>With built-in tools for prompt evaluation, you can annotate, rank and sort results for the same task across different prompt designs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scripting &amp; chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable commands which can trigger scripts.</li>
  <li>These scripts can then: <em>i.</em> do computation, or <em>ii.</em> trigger API requests to do actions, get more information, call other prompts, etc.</li>
  <li>In particular, this scripting interface can chain prompts together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Higher level API interface</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The OpenAI API is all about simplicity, it is a raw text-in, text-out interface, which is great to build on top of but does not make it easy to best take advantage of the tool.</li>
  <li>We envision a higher level API which you can use to develop higher-level reasoning and operations on top of the low level API. Turn any prompt, which itself can be a pipeline of other prompts, into an API.</li>
  <li>This enables a more broadly useful natural language interface for: chat, question answering, text transformations, multi-step labeling, and other pipelines of natural language operations</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main id="main-content"> <section> <div>   <p>We’re excited to announce the first beta release and general availability of the <strong>Rome</strong> linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p> <p>This is the beginning of an entire suite of tools. Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/#development-status">more</a>, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain.</p> <p>Rome is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tool containing functionality that has traditionally been separate tools in the frontend ecosystem. We call this a toolchain. It is <strong>not</strong> a collection of existing tools, but completely custom, built <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/credits">largely</a> from scratch, contained entirely in a single package and codebase.</p> <p>Rome is designed to replace <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, and others.</p> <p>We have significant implementations already for most components, including compiling, bundling, and testing, all using the same core abstractions and internal libraries. Rome is even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)">self-hosted</a> and we use them to <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">build and develop Rome itself</a>! Once usage as a linter has stabilized, we will move onto the unreleased features to prepare and generalize them for public usage.</p> <p>Linting is an excellent low-risk way for us to mature and validate shared functionality like editor integration, configuration, parallelization, caching, parsing, and dependency analysis. It is not in the critical build path for development so is relatively straight forward and safe to adopt.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span> rome check

See the full <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/docs/lint/rules">list of rules</a>. You can expect a full featured experience, however may still encounter bugs. With most of the feature development out of the way we will be focusing primarily on stability.</p> <p>Most of our rules have been inspired by their ESLint equivalents. This required a complete rewrite to utilize Rome’s API that differ extensively from existing tools. Without the amazing work of the ESLint team and community establishing these recommended patterns, we would not have been able to pull this off.

At the time I wasn’t trying to solve any particular problem, I was just building and experimenting with existing libraries and teaching myself new concepts. Over time though, as the project exploded in popularity, so did the scope and mission of the project.</p> <p>We renamed <strong>6to5</strong> to <strong>Babel</strong> to take on a new role as a general platform for doing static JavaScript transformation. This meant a plugin system and a new commitment to supporting future JavaScript standards and proposed features.</p> <p>We also planned on expanding Babel to be used as the base for other JavaScript language tooling by using shared public libraries. From the Babel blog post “<a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0">6.0.0 Released</a>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost">Jamie Kyle</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we think we can go even further. Babel should be able to power minifiers, linters, formatters, syntax highlighters, code completion tools, type checkers, codemod tools, and every other tool to be using the same foundation to do their job better than ever before.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <img width="600" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/6to5-to-babel.png" alt="Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo"> <figcaption>Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo</figcaption> </figure> <p>In 2016, I left the project, and those plans never materialized. Over time, I learned the Babel would not have been able to successfully adapt to execute on this vision anyway. The solution to plugins was “expose all the internals” which is an extremely large API surface area to maintain and restricts your ability to make any changes.</p> <p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers.</p> <p>There would have been no way to provide backward compatibility, and with expectations already set, any significant changes to the project would have introduced an extremely high amount of ecosystem churn.</p> <p>In an ode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, if all components of an object are replaced, is it the same object? There is far less confusion and friction to release something entirely new than drastically change something that’s already in widespread usage. I had since moved on from the project, and so any evolution would not have been possible, and would have required complete vision alignment.</p> <p>Even though I wasn’t involved in Babel, I still maintained a presence in the developer tooling ecosystem. I eventually went on to develop other tools like <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and be involved in projects like <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> and <a href="https://fbflipper.com/">Flipper</a>. This work continued to develop the ideas that would eventually become Rome and shaped my philosophy on developer experience. A focus on excellent errors, clean user interface, and minimal configuration.</p> <figure> <img width="500" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/introducing-rome-post-babel-logos.png" alt="The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper"> <figcaption>The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper</figcaption> </figure> <p>The original idea behind Babel had always stuck. What sort of capabilities would be possible if a tool did more than one thing? This sort of philosophy has always seemed alien in the JavaScript ecosystem where micropackages and arbitrary separation of concerns are the norms. These tools being independent has never provided the sort of user autonomy and efficiency that most skeptics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tools proclaim.</p> <p>Language tooling maintainers spend so much time working on the same things. Processing source code, whether it’s in a transpiler like Babel, linting it in ESLint, or bundling it in Webpack, is fundamentally the same problem with overlapping responsibilities and technical implementation.</p> <p>A linter in the JavaScript ecosystem is exactly the same as a compiler. They both consume code, then produce compiled code and errors. What the compiled code is varies. In the case of a linter, the compiled code is formatted source code with automatic fixes applied. The more powerful your compilation infrastructure, the more theoretically powerful your linter could be. These commonalities extend to pretty much anything that involves language processing. We can build more powerful tools using a shared base that is easily adaptable.</p> <p>I had always maintained private repos where I would experiment with ideas, but the original code that would become Rome was started at the beginning of 2017 while I was working for Facebook in my free time. I continued iterating and experimenting on the idea and building out all the different pieces, until 2019, when I was given the opportunity to work on and explore using it at Facebook full-time.</p> <p>I eventually left Facebook and the project became open source in February 2020 where I would continue it as an independent community-driven project.</p> <p>Rome is the spiritual successor of Babel. I’ve taken the lessons I learnt, and refined the mission. Rather than exposing a large public API for other tools to be built on, we are building them all in one place, with batteries included. I’m excited to be trying something new that the JavaScript and web ecosystem haven’t seen before.</p> <p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck">Sebastian McKenzie</a></p> </section>  </div> </section> </main> </div></div>]]>

                    <p>In this article, we will learn about India's Unified Payments Interface. A four-year-old payment scheme that has been accounting for 40-45% of digital payments across India. In December 2019, Google <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2019/November/20191113/OP-1670/OP-1670_110719_136981_396266957468_1.pdf">recommended</a> the Federal Reserve to follow the model of UPI for the design of FedNow.</p><p>It is going to be a 3 part series.</p><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>(this article): We will cover the background and basics. We will learn about the different participants and their roles in the UPI ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle"><strong>Part 2:</strong></a> We take a deep-dive into UPI by tracing a UPI transaction from the beginning through the end.</p><p><strong><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-settlement">Part 3:</a></strong> We will look at settlements and understand how money exchanges hands.</p><hr><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Since its inception in 2016, UPI has grown tremendously over the last 4 years. It has enabled a whole new set of individuals to transact digitally for the first time.</p><p>There were multiple attempts towards making India a cashless society. Earlier solutions were not simple to use and relied heavily on Netbanking facilities provided by the banks. The experience was not standard. Because of all these reasons, it was mostly used only by the tech-savvy population. India being a diverse country needed a system that has a plethora of payment apps that are optimised for different cohorts.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png" alt="" width="1468" height="1088" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1468w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Growth of UPI</figcaption></figure><p>The primary objective of UPI was to build an open payment system that is mobile-first, fast, and interoperable across different banks.</p><p>For a developing country like India, going mobile-first was almost a no brainer. Mobile Phones and Mobile Data were getting cheaper and the trend was clear.</p><p>Interoperability simply puts the user’s needs at the center. The users can opt for any payment app, link it with their bank account to engage in commerce with anyone across India.</p><p>Think about it, all of us want to use payment apps that we like, instead of being limited to a poorly designed app that’s provided by the bank where we keep our money. We should let banks do what they do best (which is managing money) and let tech companies handle building intuitive user interfaces for transacting money.</p><p>UPI was built on this principle to let private players innovate on top of public digital infrastructure.</p><h3 id="so-what-exactly-is-upi">So, What exactly is UPI?</h3><p>UPI is a payment markup language and a standard for interoperable payments in India.</p><p>To make the process of transacting money simple, UPI introduced the concept of human friendly unique IDs called UPI Virtual Payment Addresses (or VPAs). The VPAs are usually of the form <strong><em>&lt;unique_identifier&gt;</em></strong>@<strong><em>&lt;address_provider&gt;</em></strong>.</p><p>The UPI VPAs are similar to email addresses. They are interoperable. A gmail user can send an email to a yahoo user. </p><p>Some simple examples UPI VPAs are <strong><em>alice@ybl </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob@axis</em></strong>. Here, <strong><em>ybl</em></strong> and <strong><em>axis </em></strong>are two banks that provide virtual payment addresses. And, <strong><em>alice </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob </em></strong>are the unique identifiers in respective address providers.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/payment_markup.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Just like how domains get resolved to IP addresses, every VPA needs to be linked to a bank account. The UPI handles get resolved to bank accounts and IFSC during the payment (we will see how).</p><p>In short, a UPI Virtual Payment Address serves as the addressing layer for a bank account.</p><p>There are mainly two types of transactions in the UPI realm.</p><h4 id="direct-payment">Direct Payment</h4><p>The payer (the sender) initiates the transaction. Typical examples would be, you paying a shopkeeper at the checkout by scanning a QR code or you sending money to your friends and family.</p><h4 id="collect-request">Collect Request</h4><p>The payee (the receiver) initiates the transaction. A simple example is a scenario where your landlord creates a collect request asking you to pay the monthly rent.</p><hr><h2 id="the-ecosystem">The Ecosystem</h2><p>There are three types of participants in the UPI ecosystem.</p><h3 id="the-banks">The Banks</h3><p>Banks hold your money. UPI works directly with the bank accounts, unlike Paytm, Venmo, or CashApp. The bank account will be debited from or credited to whenever you send money or receive money.</p><p>The banks that hold your money are also called <em>Issuing Banks</em>.</p><p>Every bank uses a system called Core Banking System (CBS) to manage its user’s accounts. At the core, CBS is a simple <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> system built around user accounts.</p><p>Debit and Credit are the two fundamental operations of core banking software.The debit is when you’re taking money out of your account. The amount involved is subtracted from your balance. On the other hand, when you’re getting paid, its a credit. The money is added to your account.</p><p>Banks also maintain another UPI specific database. We will discuss more on that later.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png" alt="" width="2328" height="1840" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-payment-apps">The Payment Apps</h3><p>Payment Apps are consumer-centric products that can be used to link a bank account and transact in the real world. Some major apps are Google Pay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc. Almost all the banks have their own versions of UPI Apps. There is a wide variety of options to chose from.</p><p>Payment Apps allow users to create handles to make everyday transactions easier. However, not everyone can start creating UPI handles. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates who can create UPI handles. Currently, only the member banks of the UPI ecosystem are allowed to do so.</p><p>That’s why all the payment apps will have to tie up with banks. These banks not only allow payment apps to create and manage UPI handles for their users, but they are also the interface to the UPI ecosystem.</p><p>These banks are called <em>Acquiring Banks</em>.</p><p>Google Pay has tied up with HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI. PhonePe has a tie-up with Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.</p><p>Banks provide separate APIs to allow payment apps to create and manage the UPI handles.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png" alt="" width="2540" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="npci">NPCI</h3><p>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a non-profit set up by the Government of India to facilitate digital payments. They facilitate many payment schemes (like IMPS, BBPS, FASTag, etc.)</p><p>If we reflect back on the original objective of UPI, it was to build an interoperable system. An interoperable means anyone could download a payment app, link any bank (that they own), and transact with anyone else from any other bank.</p><p>One primitive way of building such an interoperable network would be to connect every payment app with every bank. As you’re probably guessing, that’s a very inefficient way of doing it, even if we assume something like that is possible. It practically not possible.</p><p>And, the only thing that’s constant in the software realm, is the fact that systems keep changing and breaking. Imagine the pain that everyone has to go through in reaching a consensus when configurations or infrastructures change. It would be chaos.</p><p>This approach is the same as building an Internet where your browser has to remember the IP address of every possible website on the planet, otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to access it.</p><p>Of course, the Internet is not built in this fashion. The job of resolving every web address into an IP address is taken out as a separate protocol called DNS. Our browsers trust the IP address resolved by the DNS servers used by our Internet Service Providers.</p><p>Introducing standardization and a trusted third party will result in a completely different architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png" alt="" width="3000" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>That’s the route UPI creators took, they made NPCI as the trusted switch and they standardized the protocol. NPCI makes sure that data flow between banks and payment apps are routed to the correct and verified destinations.</p><p>The end result, the payment apps, and banks talk just to NPCI and can be assured by NPCI that they are really interacting with who they intend to.</p><p>To make this easy to understand, we made a GIF.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="851" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Apart from being the trusted router, NPCI also hosts non-financial meta APIs to serve everyone in the ecosystem.</p><p>Some examples of meta API are <em>listAccountProviders (returns all details of all banks), validateAddress (helps in validating VPAs), requestOtp (for 2FA), </em>etc.</p><p>NPCI has one more important role to play. It’s something to do with settlement. We will cover in the last part of the series.</p><hr><p>Before we wrap the first series, let's quickly visit authentication.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>UPI uses 2-factor authentication. Commonly used factors are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Possession_factors" rel="noopener">possession factor</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Knowledge_factors" rel="noopener">knowledge factor</a>.</p><p>UPI being mobile-first, the possession factor (“what a user has”) is the user’s phone. It’s validated using the device fingerprint.</p><p>The knowledge factor (“what a user knows”) is the 4 digits or 6 digits UPI PIN.</p><p>The authentication scheme is designed to be flexible and can use different authentication factors in the future.</p><p>We will learn how these authentication factors are verified in the upcoming articles.</p><hr><p>That’s a wrap of the first part of the series.</p><p>We hope you enjoyed it. Share it with the intellectually curious folks in your circle. If you have any questions regarding UPI or anything related to Fintech in general, feel free to post them on our <a href="https://discuss.setu.co/">forum</a>.</p><p>In the <a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle">next part</a> of the series, we will take a detailed look into how UPI transactions work. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.prepear.com/">Prepear</a> is a meal planner and grocery list app that helps people discover recipes and more. It’s a spin off from the founders of <em><a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/">Super Healthy Kids</a></em> and right now they saying its logo is under legal attack from Apple.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>It’s funny what Instagram accounts you follow as a parent at some point. Yesterday, we noticed <em>Super Healthy Kids</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmcFEInZK7/">sharing a post</a> detailing their new legal woes with Apple.</p>
<p>According to the founders, Apple “has opposed the trademark application for our small business, Prepear, demanding that we change our obviously pear shaped logo, used to represent our brand in the recipe management and meal planning business.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">In a petition on Change.org</a>, Prepear goes on to say, “before attacking us, Apple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos. Many of those logos were changed or abandoned. Most small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.”</p>
<p>Prepear says they are a small company with only five staff and legal costs have already cost them “many thousands of dollars” plus laying off one team member, in their legal fight against the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>“It is a very terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the largest companies in the world, even when we have clearly done nothing wrong, and we understand why most companies just give in and change their logos,” adds Prepear in its plea for support.</p>
<p>Prepear says they “feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple’s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.”</p>
<p>So far, just over 8,200 signatures have been signed out of a goal of 10,000 on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">change.org</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the two logos above, I can’t say the Prepear logo resembles the Apple logo at all. But of course, Apple feels different about that.</p>
<p>Prepear is a free app and available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prepear/id1248495163">download on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prepear.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can check out Apple’s trademark opposition filed above (via <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/08/legal-action-against-company-with-pear-logo/">MacRumors</a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Update August 9</strong>: Prepear’s COO, Russ Monson, told <em>iPhone in Canada</em> in an email more insight in regards to the company’s filing of their trademark for the ‘pear’ logo.</p>
<p>Monson says Prepear filed their trademark for the logo back in January 2017 and eventually was told by the U.S. Trademark office “that it was not in conflict with any other registered trademarks and that they would publish it for opposition.” Everything seemed good to go.</p>
<p>That was until on the “on the last day of the window to oppose the trademark we received notice that Apple had filed for an extension of the window to oppose, and they subsequently filed for additional extensions which put our trademark in legal limbo for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p>According to Monson, Apple filed their actual opposition on the final day they were legally allowed. Subsequent extensions filed result in more legal fees for a company like Prepear to take on, which they said “seemed designed by their legal team to be made as long, difficult, and expensive as possible for us.”</p>
<p>Monson goes on to explain Prepear was “naive enough” to think they could discuss the matter with Apple rationally, as both logos look different. But that wasn’t the case and the opposition has reached the ‘discovery phase’, which the COO says will “be the most expensive part of this case for us.”</p>
<p>After Apple filed to proceed to discovery phase, that’s what Prepear decided to start their petition. “We believe that this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple’s position on this that Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than have the public see how they are clearly harming us for no apparent justifiable reason,” said Monson to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em></p>
<p>Prepear says they aren’t asking for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone maker to “stop attacking small businesses like ours in frivolous cases that seem designed to cause us to spend as much money and time thinking about the case instead of focusing on how to grow our business and ensure we survive the current economic crisis.”</p>
<p>Monson shared with<em> iPhone in Canada</em> some other oppositions Apple had previously filed against, in a similar fashion to what is happening them right now. These companies below gave up when Apple reached out, but Prepear says they are lucky to garner enough media attention “to expose this practice by Apple.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg" alt="" width="992" height="1042" srcset="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg 992w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-333x350.jpg 333w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-457x480.jpg 457w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-768x807.jpg 768w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-660x693.jpg 660w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-560x588.jpg 560w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px"></a></p>
<p>Prepear says it will be handing its petition of signatures–which currently stands at nearly 19,000 signatures–to Apple soon and will be sharing updates on what happens. The company explains to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it hopes Apple will drop the case before it gets to more expensive discovery and trial phases.</p>

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>
<h2 id="docker-network-theory">Docker Network Theory</h2>
<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-host-network-bridge">Single-host network bridge</h2>
<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="connecting-container-directly-to-host-network-stack">Connecting container directly to host network stack</h2>
<p>Docker gives us possibility to integrate container network stack into host stack.<br>
In such situation container will not get his own IP address and MAC(neither externally from docker host network, neither internally from network created by docker engine) - he will be reachable as he will be normal software running on our host.</p>
<p>This is good solution if we want to run some software that use network but we want to have full isolation of process(pid), mount(mnt), user and IPC namespaces.</p>
<p>To active such mode we use <code>--network=host</code> parameter to <code>docker run</code>.<br>
In this mode <code>--publish</code> doesn’t work - if service in container listen on port 80 - port 80 on docker host will be taken.</p>

<p>It will create for us docker network - all containers connected to this network will be visible in docker host network as they were normal separate from docker host that host them machines.</p>
<p>Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>with MACVLAN you can easily exhaust IP adresses in your network</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the past few years, I’ve been involved in migrations from Xcode workspace based build system to Buck twice (Facebook and Snapchat). Both of these experiences took talented engineers multi-months work with many fixes upstreamed to get it work. Recently, I’ve been helping another company to migrate their iOS project from Xcode workspace based build system to Bazel. This experience may be relevant to other people, considering the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html#migrating-to-bazel">Bazel guide</a> is quite light on details.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>Why in these companies, people choose to use alternative build tools such as Buck or Bazel but not Xcode? There are a few reasons:</p>

<h3 id="better-code-review-and-dependency-management">Better Code Review and Dependency Management</h3>

<p>Xcode stores its build configurations in both xcscheme files and pbxproj files. None of them are text-editor friendly and heavily rely on Xcode GUI for its configurations. There are ways to only use xcconfig, a text-based configuration file for pbxproj. But for many real-world projects, that is just the third place for build configurations rather than the only source of truth. As a result, configuration changes are impossible to review effectively in any popular web tools (GitHub / Gitlab / Gerrit).</p>

<p>Xcode does dependency management in implicit ways. Thus, you have to create xcworkspace to include all dependent sub-projects for build. This is problematic if you want to split your projects and tests into smaller manageable units. That often ends up with many xcworkspace projects and each need to have manual dependency management and being included in CI tool.</p>

<h3 id="better-caching-and-faster-build-speed">Better Caching and Faster Build Speed</h3>

<p>Xcode’s build cache management is quite incompetent. A change in the scheme can result in rebuilding from scratch. Switching between branches can often result in full rebuilding as well.</p>

<p>Bazel is a <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/release-engineering/#hermetic-builds-nqslhnid">hermetic build system</a>. If a file or its dependency doesn’t change, a rebuild won’t be triggered. Switching between branches won’t slow down the build because artifacts are cached by its content.</p>

<p>Bazel provided an upgrade path from its primitive disk-based cache system to <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">a distributed remote cache</a>. You can make a switch when the codebase grows or the team grows.</p>

<h3 id="better-modularization">Better Modularization</h3>

<p>Swift likes to have smaller modules. Having each module as its own project poses challenges in code review and dependency management. There are alternative solutions such as Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods. Both of them have their unique set of problems (SPM is often too opinionated, while CocoaPods is slow and invasive).</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Engineering teams often have competing priorities. For many teams, it is unlikely that their starting point will be a Bazel-based project (hopefully this will change in the future). When to prioritize the migration to Bazel? I’ve read it somewhere a good summary on this, and will just put it here: <em>a good time to migrate to Bazel is when you about to need it</em>. If the team starts to feel the pain of Xcode-based build system (multi-minute build time, a ball of mud mono-project, or many small projects but with CI brokages many times every week), it can often take months to do the migration. On the other hand, when you have only 2 people developing an app, it is simply hard to judge the value proposition.</p>

<p>A semi mono-project, with 3 to 4 developers, and some external dependencies (~10 CocoaPods libraries) would be a good place to allocate 1 engineer-week to do the transition. That’s what I did here.</p>



<p>The first step of the migration is to set up the tools. We will use <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk">Bazelisk</a> to manage Bazel versions, and will symlink Bazelisk to <code>/usr/local/bin/bazel</code> for ease of access. For Xcode integration, we will use <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi">Tulsi</a>. It will be installed from source. Both tools are checked out under: <code>$HOME/${Company_Name}/devtools</code> directory. The installation is automated through scripts inside the repository.</p>

<h2 id="setup-repository-directory-structure">Setup Repository Directory Structure</h2>

<p>While it is possible to manage external dependencies through <code>WORKSPACE</code>, Bazel loves monorepo. Thus, we are going to vendoring almost all our dependencies into our repository. The repository will be reorganized from a one-project centric layout to a monorepo layout.</p>

<h2 id="the-migration">The Migration</h2>

<h3 id="bazel-basics">Bazel Basics</h3>

<p>If you haven’t, now is a good time to read the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a>. We first setup an <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/5127262a28f77946908591fd176b90a8">ordinary <code>WORKSPACE</code> file</a> that has <code>rules_apple</code>, <code>rules_swift</code> and <code>xctestrunner</code> imported.</p>

<p>This will allow us to start to use <code>swift_library</code>, <code>swift_binary</code> and <code>ios_application</code> to quickly build iOS app using Bazel.</p>

<p>For Xcode integration, we use the <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/blob/master/src/tools/generate_xcodeproj.sh"><code>generate_xcodeproj.sh</code></a> script to create Xcode project with Tulsi. The <code>tulsiproj</code> however, was never checked into our repository. This keeps our Bazel <code>BUILD</code> file the only source of truth for our build configurations.</p>

<p>At this step, we exhausted what we learned from the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a> and need to face some real-world challenges.</p>

<h3 id="cocoapods-dependencies">CocoaPods Dependencies</h3>

<p>It is hard to avoid CocoaPods if you do any kind of iOS development. It is certainly not the best, but it has accumulated enough popularity that everyone has a <code>.podspec</code> file somewhere in their open-source repository. Luckily, there is the <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/PodToBUILD">PodToBUILD</a> project from Pinterest to help alleviate the pain of manually converting a few CocoaPods dependencies to Bazel.</p>

<p>First, I use <code>pod install --verbose</code> to collect some information about the existing project’s CocoaPods dependency. <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/0bba51a54ef8b1308cf74ef0769f4f82">This script</a> is used to parse the output and generate <code>Pods.WORKSPACE</code> file that PodToBUILD want to use. We use the <code>bazel run @rules_pods//:update_pods</code> to vendoring CocoaPods dependencies into the repository.</p>

<p>Some dependencies such as Google’s Protobuf already have <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/BUILD">Bazel support</a>. After vendoring, we can switch from PodToBUILD generated one to the official one. Some of the dependencies are just static / dynamic binary frameworks. We can just use <code>apple_dynamic_framework_import</code> / <code>apple_static_framework_import</code>. Pure Swift projects support in PodToBUILD is something to be desired. But luckily, we can simply use <code>swift_library</code> for these dependencies. They usually don’t have complicated setup.</p>

<p>Some do. Realm is a mix of C++17, static libraries (<code>librealm.a</code>) and Swift / Objective-C sources. We can still use PodToBUILD utilities to help, and it is a good time to introduce <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/blob/master/doc/rules.md#swift_c_module"><code>swift_c_module</code></a> that can use <code>modulemap</code> file to create proper Swift imports.</p>

<p>The <strong>C++17</strong> portion is interesting because until this point, we used Bazel automatically created <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/toolchains.html">toolchains</a>. This toolchain, unfortunately, forced C++11 (at least for Bazel 3.4.1 on macOS 10.15). The solution is simple. You need to copy <code>bazel-$(YourProject)/external/local_config_cc</code> out into your own <code>common/bazel_tools</code> directory. Thus, we will no longer use the automatically generated toolchains configuration. You can modify C++11 to C++17 in the forked <code>local_config_cc</code> toolchain.</p>

<p>Here is what my <code>.bazelrc</code> looks like after CocoaPods dependencies migration:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-application">The Application</h3>

<p>If everything goes well, depending on how many CocoaPods dependencies you have, you may end up on day 3 or day 5 now. At this point, you can build each of your CocoaPods dependencies individually. It is time to build the iOS app with Bazel.</p>

<p>There actually aren’t many gotchas for building in the simulator. Following the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a> and set up your dependencies properly, you should be able to run the app inside the simulator.</p>

<p>If you have any bridging header (which you should avoid as much as possible!), you can add <code>["-import-objc-header". "$(location YourBridgingHeader.h)"]</code> to your <code>swift_library</code>’s <code>copts</code>.</p>

<p>To run the app from the device, it may need some extra work. First, Bazel needs you to tell it the exact location of provisioning files. I elected to store development provisioning files directly in <code>ios/ProvisioningFiles</code> directory. With more people, this may be problematic to update, since each addition of device or developer certificate requires a regeneration of provisioning files. Alternatively, you can manage them through <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane tools</a>.</p>

<p>iOS devices are often picky about the entitlements. Make sure you have the proper <code>application-identifier</code> key-value pair in your entitlements file.</p>

<p>If you use Xcode, now is a good time to introduce the <code>focus.py</code> script. This script will take a Bazel target, and generate / open the Xcode project for you. It is a good idea to have such a script to wrap around <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/blob/master/src/tools/generate_xcodeproj.sh"><code>generate_xcodeproj.sh</code></a>. You will inevitably need some light modifications around the generated Xcode project or scheme files beyond what Tulsi is capable of. <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/ccbbfe94fed7bfe07148a6ffd200b06e">Here is mine</a>.</p>

<p>You can use such script like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>./focus.py ios/Apps/Project:Project
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="dynamic-frameworks">Dynamic Frameworks</h4>

<p><code>rules_apple</code> in 04/2020 <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/issues/746">introduced a bug that won’t codesign dynamic frameworks properly</a>. It is not a big deal for people that have no dynamic framework dependency (you should strive to be that person!). For many mortals, this is problematic. Simply switching to <code>rules_apple</code> prior to that commit will fix the issue.</p>

<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>

<p>Bazel, as it turns out, has fantastic support for simulator-based tests. I still remember the days to debug Buck issues around hosted unit tests and alike.</p>

<p>Many projects may start with something called <em>Hosted Tests</em> in the Xcode world. It is quick and dirty. With <em>Hosted Tests</em>, you have full access to UIKit, you can even write fancy <a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing">SnapshotTesting</a>. However, now is a good time for you to separate your tests out into two camps: a library test and a hosted test.</p>

<p>A library test in Bazel is a <code>ios_unit_test</code> without <code>test…</code></p></div></div>

<p>A few years back, I did some work for a sensor network startup. Since then, I’ve always been on the lookout for new sensor hardware and tools. I just moved into a new apartment, and discovered the VegeHub when searching for soil moisture sensors to use on my flower boxes.</p>

<p>The VegeHub supports sending your data to a few online storage providers (a.k.a <em>The Cloud</em>), or to a custom web service. I considered adding support to <a href="https://bigsense.io/">BigSense</a>, a sensor web service I wrote in <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/video/big-sense-rest-web-services-in-scala-for-sensor-networks-wellington-java-user-group/">Scala</a>. Instead, I decided it would be a good time to experiment with a time series database. I wrote a small Python Flask application called <a href="https://gitlab.com/djsumdog/senseflux">SenseFlux</a> to store VegeHub data in InfluxDB. In this post, I’ll show you how you can setup SenseFlux and InfluxDB using <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/my-love-hate-relationship-with-docker-and-container-orchestration-systems/">Docker</a>, and graph sensor data using chronograf. Let’s get started.</p>

</figure>

<p>The VegeHub’s web interface allows you to set a custom web service endpoint, an API Key and a Channel ID. The Channel ID is what SenseFlux will use to identify the sensor data and store it InfluxDB. SenseFlux will also use the API key for validation.</p>

<p>SenseFlux is a Python application which uses <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> for its application framework and <a href="https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/">Waitress</a> for its web server. It can accept data from a VegeHub sent to the <code>/create/vghub</code> endpoint. The data is stored in InfluxDB and can be viewed using tools like Chronograf. The easiest way to get started is to run these components in Docker containers. The following establishes a Docker network and then creates the appropriate containers for InfluxDB and SenseFlux, exposing the SenseFlux port on the host machine.</p>

<pre>docker network create sensenet

docker run -d --name influx-sf --network sensenet \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER=influx \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; \
    -v influx-state:/var/lib/influxdb \
    influxdb

docker run -d --name senseflux-sf --network sensenet -p 8003:8003 \
    -e SF_API_KEY=TESTKey \
    -e INFLUXDB_HOST=influx-sf \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER=influx \
    -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; battlepenguin/senseflux:v0.0.9 \
    -e FIELD1=Humidity \
    -e FIELD2=SoilTemperature \
    -e FIELD3=SoilMoisture \
    -e FIELD4=Darkness
    -e FIELD5=Battery

</pre>

<p>In the above example, create a secure password for <code>&lt;SecurePassword&gt;</code>, and set each field input to the appropriate sensor type. Ensure the <code>SF_API_KEY</code> matched what’s configured on the VegeHub. Fields that are not defined will default to the type <code>Voltage</code>, scaling the range of 0.0 to 3.0 volts to a number between 0 and 100.</p>

<p>The VegeHub Wi-Fi was the most expensive component of this setup at $140. It comes with firmware that has a web interface for configuration. It’s not a general purpose device and the software on it is closed source and proprietary.</p>

<p>For comparison, a Raspberry Pi or Beagle Bone would be between $35 ~ $65 depending on the model. Single Board Computers (SBCs) are more general purpose devices, and would need <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/video/ltsense-using-embedded-python-for-sensor-networks-wellington-python-user-group/">additional software</a> and configuration to become a sensor relay. SBCs also consume considerably more power, would not run nearly as long with similar batteries, and additional hardware would be needed to turn the device on and off at regular intervals to read sensor data in order to conserve battery. Embedded hardware like an Arduino might be a more comparable device when it comes to storage and power consumption.</p>

  <figcaption>
      

      Inside of VegeHub Wi-Fi Module

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The built in Wi-Fi is unable to see 5Ghz wireless access points, so you must have a <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/building-a-thin-itx-router/">Wi-Fi router</a> that supports either 2.4Ghz or dual 2.4Ghz/5Ghz configurations. The range of its Wi-Fi is not very good. I had to move my router about a meter closer to my balcony so the VegeHub could make reliable connections. Sometimes it would stop reporting for hours and I’d have to open the case, just so it could establish a reliable signal. I do live in an apartment, so there may be noise and interference issues. It can store 64 samples per channel in the event it can’t communicate with SenseFlux. If you use the default sample rate of 5 minutes, it can cache about five and a half hours worth of samples.</p>

<p>The VegeHub supports transmitting data over SSL/TLS, but it only appears to have certificates for the major hosting providers it supports. I could not get the VegeHub to send data to an instance of SenseFlux secured by LetsEncrypt certificates. I suspect the limited storage on the VegeHub doesn’t allow for it to have many of the standard certificate authorities found in most operating systems and web browsers. Their website does have instructions for flashing your own certificates via its USB interface, however I didn’t attempt this myself.</p>

<figure>

      VegeHub Wi-Fi, Battery Box and Sensors

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The VegeHub has minimal setup and can start logging data to one of its supported cloud providers right out of the box. It does provide an easy way to collect sensor, however the software lacks useful error messages via the web interface. If I were making suggestions to the VegeHub engineers, I’d suggest the following feature set in their next release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>External waterproof Wi-Fi antenna</li>
  <li>More on-board storage</li>
  <li>Better diagnostics via the web interface</li>
  <li>Include all standard SSL certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with these limitations, the VegeHub is still an okay solution. Be sure you have a powerful Wi-Fi access point very close to the device, and change the defaults to a higher refresh interval, in order to minimize data loss.</p>

<h3 id="chronograf">Chronograf</h3>

<p>You can use the following to launch a Chronograf container to read and graph data out of InfluxDB.</p>

<pre>docker run --name chronograf-sf --network sensenet -p 8888:8888 \
  -v chronograf-state:/var/lib/chronograf \
  -e INFLUXDB_URL=http://influx-sf:8086 \
  -e INFLUXDB_USERNAME=influx \
  -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; \
  chronograf
</pre>

<p>This will expose a web interface at port 8888, which can be used to create graphs and dashboards. The following is a dashboard I created for the VegeHub Sensors.</p>

      Sensor Graphs from July 30th to August 7th 2020

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The soil temperature, humidity and light saturation sensors returned reasonable data and pretty much work as expected. The battery sensor has fewer data points as it’s only recorded whenever the VegeHub sends data. I’m assuming it is a simple voltage sensor, which can vary due to the temperature of the batteries.</p>

<p>At first, the soil moisture sensor seemed to continually send a voltage of 3.3, which turned into a reading of 109%. It was recording 0 when it wasn’t in my flower box, so I thought there may have been a short. After repositioning the sensor, I started to get readings between 7% to 9%. I don’t have another soil moisture sensor to compare it to, so I’m not sure how accurate the readings are.</p>

<h3 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h3>

<p>In my <a href="https://bigsense.io/">previous sensor network project</a>, I created a web service that could use either MySQL, Postgres or Microsoft SQL as a data storage backend. SenseFlux is my first attempt at using a time series database. An early bug in SenseFlux caused data to be stored as strings instead of floats<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and InfluxDB doesn’t allow for changing a schema or casing from strings back to numeric types<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. I ended up having to export the entire database and write a script to reload the data. During my development process, I discovered the following InfluxDB limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schema cannot be modified once created</li>
  <li>No ability to delete specific old or invalid records</li>
  <li>Old data is only deleted if it’s configured to expire</li>
</ul>

<p>InfluxDB has very specific use cases for reading measures from hundreds or thousands of sensors at high intervals. It’s commonly found in devops applications for monitoring data from virtual machines, such as CPU and disk space usage. It’s also used for storing readings from sensors in data centers, such as cabinet temperature or network switch throughput. It works well in situations where old data needs to expire at regular intervals, but it may not be the best tool for measuring inputs from environmental sensors, which tend to have much lower sample rates. InfluxDB may be better suited for large deployments of agriculture sensors.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>This was a fun project. I got to try out a new device, write some code and create some pretty graphs. I’d be hesitant to recommend the VegeHub at this point, due to the Wi-Fi connectivity, firmware limitations and data transmission issues. However, I think the device is a good idea and consumers need more products that allow their data to be processed by a variety of services, as well as the ability to keep and host the data themselves. <a href="https://gitlab.com/djsumdog/senseflux">SenseFlux</a> is a simple example of how to write middleware that can transform sensor data, so it can be stored and viewed with a variety of existing open source tools.</p>

If you’ve used Snap Search, you’ll find lots of banners and vector images used throughout the app. However, it comes with a very obvious risk: loading large images can slow down your app, and increase the apk size. I have a <strong><em>total 321 files in the drawable folder</em></strong> for Snap Search, and the following method is my easy trick to reduce APK size on Android.</p> <p>For those who are in a hurry and just want to know it quickly, these are the steps I follow:</p><ul><li>Save your image as a .png file</li><li>Compress your image using <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a></li><li>Add the compressed image to your drawable folder</li><li>Right click on file, select ‘Convert o WebP’</li></ul><p>This whole process, on an average compresses the image by almost 80-90%. The images do NOT lose any quality at all, and your UI is still snappy and responsive to load and use.</p><p>Let’s check an example:</p><h2>Example to Reduce APK Size</h2><p>Here’s an example of an image in Snap Search, highlighting one of the premium features ( <a href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/">there are quite a few</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is a condensed version of part of the second chapter, which focuses on the history of lockdowns and how they became government policy. Hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>The entire booklet is available on Amazon at https://amzn.to/33reYrm and at iBooks at https://apple.co/2PoNhqI.</p>

<p>By Alex Berenson</p>
<p>In March, as the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic jumped to Europe and the United States, epidemiologists and public health experts told governments to lock down – fast and hard. Not just mass gatherings, but schools, offices, malls, even parks and beaches. To do anything less would be to sentence millions of people to death, the experts said.</p>
<p>Most infamously, the Imperial College London report of March 16 – written by researchers who were working with the World Health Organization – predicted more than 2 million American coronavirus deaths without immediate action. It called for a policy of what Professor Neil Ferguson, the report’s lead author, termed “suppression”:</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>(Of course, Professor Ferguson exempted himself from his mandate. Two weeks after the report came out, as the entire United Kingdom had locked down, and <em>while Ferguson himself was still supposed to be self-isolating after contracting the coronavirus, </em>he had an affair with a married woman who traveled across London to meet him.)</p>
<p>The stunning impact of the Imperial College report made Ferguson arguably the most important public health expert in the world. Yet he was neither physician nor virologist. His PhD was in theoretical physics, arguments about the structure of the universe that are something close to pure math.</p>
<p>But he and the other Imperial College researchers appeared to believe a handful of relatively simple equations would predict the coronavirus epidemic. At their core, these models are simply software programs designed to simulate reality, based on the assumptions that the person who creates them inputs into them. They are as realistic as a game of SimCity, though less colorful.</p>
<p>Nonethless, Ferguson’s model produced highly precise answers. Lockdowns could reduce coronavirus deaths 95 percent if they continued until a vaccine was developed. Ferguson and his team even offered different death projections based on the severity of the lockdowns and benchmarks used to lift and reinstate them.</p>
<p>These details gave the Imperial College model an undeserved sense of certainty and reliability. In this sense, they were like other mathematical simulations of real-world events – like the ones that helped fuel the 2008 housing and financial meltdown.</p>
<p>But for all the complexity of his equations, Ferguson really offered nothing more than an updated version of the original frightened rationale for the quarantines European city-states had imposed during the Black Death seven centuries earlier: <em>Keep strangers away and we’ll be safe.</em></p>

<p>The idea of using widespread lockdowns to slow epidemics took off in 2006, as The New York Times reported in April. After a flu scare in 2005, then-President George W. Bush asked scientists for research on slowing epidemics. Dr. Carter Mecher, an internist at the Department of Veterans Affairs, connected with Robert Glass, a computer scientist at Sandia National Laboratories.</p>
<p>For a science project, Glass’s 14-year-old daughter had created a model of the way social distancing might slow the spread of the flu<em>. </em>Glass built on it to create a simulation “proving” lockdowns could reduce an influenza epidemic in a hypothetical town of 10,000 people by 90 percent. “Dr. Mecher received the results at his office in Washington and was amazed,” the Times wrote.</p>
<p>Robert and Laura Glass ultimately became the first two authors on a paper about the simulation. Inevitably, it contained a shout-out to Neil Ferguson. And sure enough, it showed the “mitigation strategies” worked.</p>
<p>In the retelling of this heroic lockdowns-for-all story by the Times, the conclusions of the paper took the CDC by storm. “In February 2007, the C.D.C. made their approach – bureaucratically called Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions, or NPIs – official U.S. policy.”</p>
<p>The reality was different.</p>
<p>The 2007 CDC paper ran 108 pages and included descriptions of many ways to reduce transmission, from “voluntary isolation of ill adults” to “reducing density in public transit.” (<a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425">https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425</a>)</p>
<p>Crucially, it also contained a “Pandemic Severity Index” that included five categories. On the low end, Category 1 represented a normal seasonal flu season, which still might kill up to 90,000 Americans. On the high end, a Category 5 pandemic, like the Spanish flu, would kill at least 1.8 million Americans.</p>
<p>Based on the CDC’s scale, Sars-Cov-2 almost certainly should be classified as Category 2 epidemic, meaning it will cause between 90,000 and 450,000 deaths. For an epidemic like that, the CDC merely said governments should <em>consider</em> school closures of less than four weeks, along with moderate efforts to reduce contacts among adults, such as telecommuting.</p>
<p>The prospect of closing all retail stores or offices <em>is not even mentioned in the paper, </em>not even for the most severe epidemics.</p>
<p>Yet the Times glossed over these distinctions in its article. It wrote instead “the (Bush) administration ultimately sided with the proponents of social distancing and shutdowns” and claimed the coronavirus response came directly from the original CDC report. “Then the coronavirus came, and the plan was put to work across the country for the first time.”</p>

<p>Even as the CDC was putting its 2007 plan together, many scientists and physicians with expertise in treating pandemics worried about the weakness of real-world evidence for lockdowns and other interventions.</p>
<p>Among the most vocal critics of lockdowns was Dr. Donald Henderson, who led the successful effort to eradicate smallpox. In December 2006, Henderson and three others wrote an 11-page paper called “Disease Mitigation Measures in the Control of Pandemic Influenza.” After outlining potential lockdown measures, they wrote, “We must ask whether any or all of the proposed measures are epidemiologically sound… [and] consider possible secondary social and economic impacts.”</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bsp.2006.4.366?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bsp.2006.4.366?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;</a>)</p>
<p>Efforts in past epidemics to slow – much less stop – the spread of the flu had largely failed, the authors wrote. They attacked quarantines, travel bans, and school closings of more than two weeks as likely counterproductive. They did not even mention full lockdowns, presumably because they viewed those as so unlikely. And near the end of the paper, they made a heartfelt plea:</p>
<p>Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted.</p>
<p>In 2020, their warning went unheeded.</p>

  <div>
    <p>So far everything we’ve done with breakpoints involved us creating a breakpoint file and using this
to automate part of a track. Now we’ll take a look at how we can take an existing track and extract
some breakpoints from this. For this post, we’ll take a look at extracting the amplitudes from the
.wave files, as this is one of the most straightforward properties that we can extract.</p>
<p>There is nothing here that we’ve not seen in the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/tags/goaudio/">previous
posts</a>, but rather we are going to combine what we’ve
already learned to create a new tool to do this.</p>
<p>In a high level overview, we’ll have to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>iterate over our frames</li>
<li>record the given amplitude (frame value)</li>
<li>write to breakpoint file</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence this would be simple enough, but we’ll make two small modifications to this
algorithm. First of all, we don’t want to just generate a breakpoint for each frame, this would just
result in a list that is equal to our frame data. We’ll use less space by just taking a snapshot at
a certain interval, e.g every 10ms, and take advantage of
our linear interpolation that happens when looking up the value of a breakpoint at a certain time.</p>
<p>A small extention to our current breakpoint code is that we need to be able to ‘batch’ the samples
into slices of a given time.</p>
<p>If you want to get to the code, everything can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/cmd/extractbrk/main.go">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The BatchSamples function will take a <code>Wave</code> and <code>seconds float64</code> as input, as this gives us enough
data to batch the frames. Given a certain SampleRate, we know how many Samples per Second we are
seeing in the file. With this information, we can find the amount of Frames per Seconds. Although
frames per second is only equal to the samples per second for mono files, but adapting for
multi-channel audio is just a matter of multiplying the SampleSize by the amount of channels.</p>
<p>The SampleSize can thus be expressed as follows: <code>SampleSize = SampleRate * Channels * seconds</code></p>
<p>When we know our sample size, we can split the raw frames into slices of this size.</p>

<p>Once we can split our frames into batches, we can call <code>BatchSamples(wave,x)</code> to get the requested
batches of a given duration. Then, we can find the max amplitude over all of these and keep
track of this over all batches.</p>
<p>The setup code is the same as usual, where we parse an input file with
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. Except that now we’ll also send the frames to the
‘BatchSamples’ function. (Error handling ignored for brevity)</p>

<p>When we run this program <code>go run main.go -i input.wav -w 15 -o output.brk</code> we can generate a
breakpoint file. I’ve created a sample waveform (something I’ll write a future blogpost about) with
variable amplitude. You can listen to it <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/input.wav">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extracted breakpoint file can be seen <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/output.brk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using audacity and your favourite plotting tool you can compare the waveform with what the
breakpoint extractor generated.</p>

Snubbing another person in favor of your phone is called <em>phubbing</em> (phone + snubbing) and it is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300704" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">common complaint in relationships</a>. <em>Phubbing your partner is called Pphubbing or Partner phubbing and research acknowledges that it worsens relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction, and could also add to depression.</em></p><h2><span id="What_is_phone_addiction">What is phone addiction?</span></h2><p>Let’s first understand what is phone addiction and what counts as excessive phone use. Phone addiction or compulsive phone use goes along-side internet addiction and social media addiction. Psychologists also call it “problematic phone use.” For this post, we will consider them together. Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way.</p><p>Strictly speaking, addiction is “the loss of control, the establishment of a dependent relationship, tolerance, the need for progressively more time and dedication, and severe interference with daily life (Echeburua et al., 2009).” Phones, internet-based activities, and any technology for that matter can become an addiction in the truest sense (even though many disagree). And sometimes, phone addicts need to be rehabilitated in a hospital.</p><p>People often get addicted to the phone because they want to <em>escape from reality</em>, <em>gain social karma</em>, <em>cope with stress caused by social anxiety and self-esteem</em>, <em>follow their greed for social validation</em>, <em>likes</em>, <em>and other types of rewards</em>, or <em>play rewarding games</em>. The constant flow of digital rewards and information can <em>pull</em> a person into addiction and day-to-day difficulties can <em>push</em> a person toward addiction.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1" alt="Phone addiction" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div><h3><span id="Indicators_of_problematic_phone_use">Indicators of problematic phone use</span></h3><p><strong>There is no cut-off point for phone use which everyone agrees to but here are some indicators</strong>.</p><ol><li>You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.</li><li>You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.</li><li>Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.</li><li>You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.</li><li>You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.</li><li>Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.</li></ol><h3><span id="Common_examples_of_problematic_phone_use">Common examples of problematic phone use</span></h3><ol><li>Infinitely scrolling through Instagram.</li><li>Playing Call of Duty or PubG for hours and social activities contain little to no honest communication.</li><li>Excessive display of hurt, loneliness, attention-seeking behavior, hate, jealousy, and disapproval on social media.</li><li>Social needs are not met (sexual intimacy, close friendship, physical touch, etc.) and online alternatives are used to compensate for poor social health (Chatbots, echo-chambers, porn, social gaming, virtual reality social games like second life, camming relationships).</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure and excitement in the offline world but excessive emotions are tied to online rewards like gambling, likes, shares, followers, sexting, masturbation to porn, etc.</li><li><em>FOMO</em> (fear of missing out) and <em>Nomophobia</em> (no-mobile phobia) cause mental and physical discomfort.</li><li>You frequently experience <em>Ringxiety</em> or <em>Textaphrenia</em> or Phantom notifications – the feeling that you received a notification when you actually did not.</li></ol><h2><span id="Fast_facts_about_phone_and_internet_use">Fast facts about phone and internet use</span></h2><ol><li><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to a 2019 report</a>, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The quarantine</a> has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.</li><li>The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.</li><li><a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Another 2019 report</a> (2018 data) says at least 3.3 billion people use the internet and social media from their phones.</li><li><a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2019/Global-State-of-Mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Comscore’s 2019 Global state of mobile</a> report says 70% of all digital media engagement in the US happens from a smartphone.

That means poor attention, poor memory, poor reasoning skills, bad decision making, etc. One of the main reasons is the role of sleep. Addiction can disturb sleep and sleep worsens cognitive performance. However, self-regulation (personal control, commitment to healthy choices, tolerating negative emotions) can counter the negative effects of addiction and that can help you overcome it.</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919311296" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">A dysfunctional family can push</a> children into addiction and one reason is social anxiety. A broken family or unhealthy parenting like neglect or excessive control can often hamper emotional growth. Children might fail to learn how to behave in social settings. There may be a fear of ridicule, disapproval, disappointment, etc. or simply a looming belief like “I am not good enough” or “I am a bad child” that creates pressure on children. These fears or thoughts transfer into the real-world and children cope with the social anxiety it causes by withdrawing into their phones – where the fantasy digital world rescues them from their real life. Fortunately, mindfulness – being aware of your actions and living in the moment as an observer – can reduce the negative impact of phone addiction.</p><p>Underlying mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and attachment issues can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215249/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase the risk</a> of phone addiction.

As long as you can first demonstrate some output. Random notifications and random experiences are potent in pulling you to check your phone precisely because they are random. Unpredictable notifications and call-to-actions are hard to anticipate so the brain maximizes their potential reward (feeling great) by constantly creating the urge to pick up the phone and check. Schedule an hour to commit to your phone or make it a rule to check it every 45 minutes. That way, the rewards will be hard to anticipate but they will occur at a known time and your brain will find it easier to adjust than completely abandoning your phone.</p><h3><span id="2_Interrupt_your_habitual_routine">2.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt your habitual routine</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Habits are hard to break because neurons in your brain rigidly fire a certain way. Once an action is repeated enough, neural circuits become efficient. They then direct and dictate behavior automatically. Countering their tendencies becomes harder. Higher the repetitions, the more stable those neurons get. These neural circuits fire in a predictable way and they fire automatically with almost no external push. You may have little to no awareness about the start of habitual actions. However, breaking a habit means you have to change how those neurons behave and the only way to do that is to ensure a change in the neural circuit. You can do that by changing 3 things:</p><ul><li><strong>The context in which the habit occurs</strong> – Identify how your mood is when you get into the phone-use black hole and do an activity that changes the mood. Instead of sitting and scrolling, start cleaning up or begin work, and occasionally take a phone break.</li><li><strong>Interrupting the trigger that kick-starts the habit</strong> – Identify the triggers and immediately distract yourself, change the room, go for a bath, etc.</li><li><strong>The verbal narrative about that habit</strong> – Change your self-talk about phone addiction. For example, change “I need to use my phone, I want to do that right now” to “I can use a strategy to use my phone in a limited way so I don’t stay an addict and still enjoy it.”</li></ul><p>For example – If you have a habit of staring at your phone right after writing an email,&nbsp;<strong>change the context</strong>&nbsp;by doing a physical stretch.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt the trigger</strong>&nbsp;by clicking send and then switching off your phone immediately. And&nbsp;<strong>change the narrative</strong>&nbsp;by telling yourself something like “<em>The email was not the end of my work, I can start another task and then go on Instagram.</em>” Even if this just delays your phone use by a few minutes, it’s progress.</p><h3><span id="3_Introspect_about_your_expectations">3.&nbsp;<strong>Introspect about your expectations</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Continuous short-interval phone checking may …</p></div></div>

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)
</li><li>Xilinx Ultrascale(+)
</li><li>Lattice iCE40
</li><li>Lattice ECP5
</li><li>QuickLogic EOS S3 and PolarPro3
</li></ul><p>Some tools to check out include:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex">LiteX</a> - A Python-based SoC builder
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/litex-hub">LiteX Hub</a> - collaborative FPGA projects based on LiteX
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv">LiteX-BuildEnv</a> - An environment for building LiteX-based FPGA designs

</li><li><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr">nextpnr</a> - a vendor neutral, timing driven place and route tool
</li><li><a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/">SymbiFlow</a> - an umbrella project for FPGA architecture definitions
</li></ul><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mithro">Tim 'mithro' Ansell</a> has an open offer to send FPGA hardware to anyone who has time to to contribute to open source FPGA projects but doesn't have any hardware.
</p>

<h4>Xilinx</h4>
<h5>Zynq</h5>
<p>Xilinx's Zynq parts are supported by their Vivado high level synthesis design suite and include a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9, USB 2.0, and Gigabit Ethernet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>It has been a year since I left social media. It was difficult to do at the time, and I kept finding excuses and reasons not to. Looking back I realise it was because I was an addict. I was addicted to the scrolling, the likes, the unlimited content.</p>
<p>I was addicted to social media in the same way I was addicted to cigarettes. I wasn’t a heavy social media user (or smoker for that matter), but I knew that it wasn’t in my best interests. I knew that it was clever capitalism that kept me on my leash, and I knew that it was robbing me of my time and my physical and mental health. But it was there with me every day. It never made me feel any better, yet I still spent time and energy on it.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to quit using social media, and few to remain connected. The switch flicked as I posted a picture of a gorgeous sunset on Instagram. I was showing off to the world how beautiful my life is, while at the same time knowing it was a false representation at that moment. At the time I was mildly depressed and hungry and cold. Did I want people to admire me right there and then? Why was I doing this?</p>
<p>The year since has been great. It’s not a huge change. Things have just regained their natural cadence. When I meet up with friends I haven’t seen in a while, we have lots to discuss since we don’t have a constant feed of one another’s lives on our smartphones. My relationships deepened as they became more intentional. It was easy to feel like I was keeping in touch when I was on social media, even though there was no conversation happening. No relationship being nurtured.</p>
<p>And finally, this has been by far the most productive year of my life. I’ve taught at an accelerator in Ghana and a university in Cape Town. I’ve started 3 projects, <a href="https://justsketch.me/">one</a> of which turned into a business that allowed me to quit my job and live a much freer life. <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Another</a> became a lovely open-sourced platform of which the ethos is dear to my heart. I've built little <a href="https://herman_the_merman.itch.io/">games</a> and played with interesting ideas.</p>
<p>The combination of productivity, but also mindful leisure has made the past year delightful. In my free time, I read books and spend time with people who are important to me. I play and exercise and don’t keep up with the Joneses. I spend time in the mountains or on beaches, and the whole world doesn’t need to know. In a fundamental way, quitting social media has made me more free.</p>

<p>Press Release No. 61/2020 of 17 July 2020</p>
<p>Order of 27 May 2020 - <a href="https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2020/05/rs20200527_1bvr187313.html;jsessionid=1AE2D2340ADED8C8F2D706096CE6643C.2_cid361" title="Beschluss vom 27. Mai 2020">1 BvR 1873/13, 1 BvR 2618/13</a> (Subscriber data II)</p>
<p>In an order published today, the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional § 113 of the Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz – TKG) and several ordinary federal laws, which govern the manual procedure for obtaining information on subscriber data. They violate the complainants’ right to informational self-determination and their right to the privacy of telecommunications (Art. 10(1) of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz – GG). The complainants are subscribers of telecommunications and internet services. The manual information procedure enables security authorities to obtain information from telecommunications enterprises, in particular, information on subscribers of telecommunications services or an IP address assigned at a certain point in time. The information that is provided includes personal customer data that is linked to the conclusion or performance of a contract (so-called subscriber data). Information on data that relates to the use of telecommunications services (so-called traffic data) and the actual content of telecommunications is not provided.<br>
In principle, providing information on subscriber data is permissible under constitutional law. Yet, similar to the image of a double-door, the legislature must create a proportionate legal basis for both the transfer of subscriber data by telecommunications providers and the retrieval of such data by the authorities. Provisions on transferring and retrieving data must adequately limit the purposes of the utilisation of data, particularly by establishing thresholds for the use of powers as part of the constituent elements of the provision and by providing for sufficiently meaningful protection of legal interests. The First Senate clarified that, in principle, despite the moderate weight of the interference, using the general powers to transfer and retrieve subscriber data in the context of maintaining public security and the activities of intelligence services requires there to be a specific danger in the individual case, and an initial suspicion of criminal conduct (Anfangsverdacht) in the context of the investigation and prosecution of offences. Where dynamic IP addresses are matched, this must additionally serve to protect or legally reinforce legal interests of at least considerable weight given the increased weight of the interference. Where, with regard to maintaining public security or activities of intelligence services, the thresholds for the use of powers require less than a specific danger, this must be compensated for by establishing stricter requirements for the weight of the legal interests meriting protection. For the most part, the challenged provisions did not satisfy these requirements. For the rest, the First Senate again held that information on login details may be provided only if the statutory requirements for its use are met.</p>

<p><strong>Facts of the case:</strong></p>

<p>§ 113 TKG permits the transfer of subscriber data by telecommunications providers in the context of a so-called manual information procedure. The other challenged provisions govern the retrieval of such data by various federal security authorities, such as the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the Federal Police Office (Bundespolizei) and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz). The challenged provisions were all aimed at implementing the Federal Constitutional Court’s decision of 24 January 2012 (Subscriber data I), in which the Court had declared parts of § 113 TKG, as it stood then, to be unconstitutional and had objected to the lack of ordinary law provisions on data retrieval. <br>
Telecommunications providers provide information pursuant to § 113 TKG at the request of one of the security authorities listed in § 113 TKG. Pursuant to § 113(1) first sentence TKG, the information that must be provided encompasses subscriber data such as the subscriber’s name, date of birth and phone number that must be retained as well as customer data which, pursuant to § 95 TKG, is retained voluntarily by the telecommunications providers for operational purposes. This usually includes the subscriber’s address, the type of the service as provided in the contract and other data such as their bank details.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(1) second sentence TKG, information must also be provided on login details like personal identification numbers (PIN) assigned by the telecommunications provider. By contrast, telecommunications providers usually only save passwords created by users themselves in an encrypted format. Thus, no information can be provided thereon.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(1) third sentence TKG, subscriber data may also be determined on the basis of an IP address that has been assigned at a specific point in time (dynamic IP address). The information that is provided includes the IP address matched to a specific subscriber and thus also forms part of the subscriber data. This is only possible where telecommunications providers analyse previously retained traffic data in order to identify the subscriber to whom the used IP address was assigned at the point in time specified in the request.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(2) first sentence TKG, information may be provided only if one of the authorities listed in § 113(3) TKG requests such information for the purpose of the investigation and prosecution of criminal or administrative offences, for averting dangers to the public order or security, or for performing the tasks conferred upon intelligence services under statutory law. In its request, the authority must state the provision that authorises data retrieval. <br>
The provisions on data retrieval challenged in the constitutional complaints set out that security authorities may request information on subscriber data from telecommunications providers. In essence, the provisions require only that the authorities need the information in order to perform their tasks. With respect to information on login details, the provisions imply that the statutory requirements for the use of such data are met. The provisions also permit requesting information on subscriber data that is determined on the basis of a dynamic IP address. The Federal Criminal Police Office, the Federal Police Office, the Customs Criminal Investigations Office (Zollkriminalamt) and the federal intelligence services are authorised to make such requests.</p>

<p><strong>Key considerations of the Senate:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I. In substantive terms, the challenged powers to transfer data under § 113 TKG do not satisfy the constitutional requirements that follow from the general right of personality deriving from Art. 2(1) in conjunction with Art. 1(1) GG and the privacy of telecommunications guaranteed by Art. 10(1) GG. It is true that these powers serve legitimate purposes – increasing the effectiveness of investigating and prosecuting offences, of maintaining public security, and of performing the tasks of the intelligence services. However, the provisions on the transfer of data are only compatible with the requirements of proportionality in its stricter sense if they limit the purposes for which these powers may be used with sufficient legal clarity.<br>
1. The powers laid down in § 113(1) first sentence TKG to request information on subscriber data in general does not satisfy these requirements.<br>
a) § 113(1) first sentence TKG permits requests for information on subscriber data in general; this amounts to an interference with the right to informational self-determination. Even though the interference is not of great weight, the challenged powers to transfer data are disproportionate because of their scope. It cannot be permissible to indiscriminately request information on data, even if its significance and possible uses are very limited. Thus, thresholds that limit the use of these powers are required; these thresholds must ensure that information can be obtained only if factual circumstances provide specific grounds for the use of these powers. Information that solely serves to facilitate the performance of the authority’s tasks in general may not be provided without specific grounds. The provision on data retrieval itself must set out thresholds for the use of these powers – this is the first door in the double door concept. In the context of maintaining public security and the activities of intelligence services, it is required that there be a specific danger in the specific case. In the context of the investigation and prosecution of offences, an initial suspicion is sufficient.<br>
However, under constitutional law, the legislature is not limited from the outset to establishing criteria for the use of powers that reflect the traditional security law approach to averting specific, imminent or present dangers. Rather, it can set wider limits by making requirements for foreseeability of the causal chain less strict under special circumstances. The legal basis for the use of powers must usually include the requirement that there be sufficient indications of a danger that is developing into being specific. For reasons stemming from the principle of proportionality, lowering the thresholds for the use of powers in such a manner is inextricably linked to increased requirements for the protection of specific legal interest; in this respect, regard must be had to the weight of the interference arising from the respective measure. Thus, interferences of lesser weight, such as requests for information on subscriber data in general might already be justified by a danger that is developing into being specific where the interferences serve to protect legal interest of at least considerable weight. <br>
In principle, these constitutional requirements apply to any authorisation to use powers with the aim of prevention and thus also to the utilisation of data by intelligence services. In this context, it …</p></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>I haven't met a developer who looked at a conflict message and did not pull their hair strands with frustration.</p><p>Trying to resolve each merge conflict is one of those things that every developer hates. Especially if it hits you when you're gearing up for a production deploy!</p><p>This is where having the right Git workflow set up can do a world of good for your <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/simple-software-development-workflow/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=git-workflow">development workflow</a>. </p><p>Of course, having the right git workflow will not solve all your problems. But it's a step in the right direction. After all, with every team working remotely, the need to build features together without having your codebase getting disrupted is critical.</p><p>How you set it up depends on the project you're working on, the release schedules your team has, the size of the team, and more!</p><p>In this article, we’ll walk you through 5 different git workflows, their benefits, their cons, and when you should use them. Let’s jump in!</p><h2 id="1-basic-git-workflow">1. Basic Git Workflow</h2><p>The most basic git workflow is the one where there is only one branch — the master branch. Developers commit directly into it and use it to deploy to the staging and production environment.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/Basic-git-workflow-3.png" alt="Basic Git Workflow"><figcaption>Basic Git Workflow with all commits getting added directly to master branch</figcaption></figure><p>This workflow isn’t usually recommended unless you’re working on a side project and you’re looking to get started quickly.</p><p>Since there is only one branch, there really is no process over here. This makes it effortless to get started with Git. However, some cons you need to keep in mind when using this workflow are:</p><ol><li>Collaborating on code will lead to multiple conflicts.</li><li>Chances of shipping buggy software to production is higher.</li><li>Maintaining clean code is harder.</li></ol><h2 id="2-git-feature-branch-workflow">2. Git Feature Branch Workflow</h2><p>The Git Feature Branch workflow becomes a must have when you have more than one developer working on the same codebase.</p><p>Imagine you have one developer who is working on a new feature. And another developer working on a second feature. Now, if both the developers work from the same branch and add commits to them, it would make the codebase a huge mess with plenty of conflicts.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/Feature-Branch-git-workflow-4.png" alt="Git feature branch workflow"><figcaption>Git workflow with feature branches</figcaption></figure><p>To avoid this, the two developers can create two separate branches from the master branch and work on their features individually. When they’re done with their feature, they can then merge their respective branch to the master branch, and deploy without having to wait for the second feature to be completed.</p><p>The Pros of using this workflow is, the git feature branch workflow allows you to collaborate on code without having to worry about code conflicts.</p><h2 id="3-git-feature-workflow-with-develop-branch">3. Git Feature Workflow with Develop Branch</h2><p>This workflow is one of the more popular workflows among developer teams. It’s similar to the Git Feature Branch workflow with a develop branch that is added in parallel to the master branch.</p><p>In this workflow, the master branch always reflects a production-ready state. Whenever the team wants to deploy to production they deploy it from the master branch.</p><p>The develop branch reflects the state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Developers create branches from the develop branch and work on new features. Once the feature is ready, it is tested, merged with develop branch, tested with the develop branch’s code in case there was a prior merge, and then merged with master.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/feature-branch-with-develop-git-workflow-2.png" alt="Git workflow with feature and develop branches"><figcaption>Git workflow with feature and develop branches</figcaption></figure><p>The advantage of this workflow is, it allows teams to consistently merge new features, test them in staging, and deploy to production. While maintaining code is easier, it can get a little tiresome for some teams since it can feel like going through a tedious process.</p><h2 id="4-gitflow-workflow">4. Gitflow Workflow</h2><p>The gitflow workflow is very similar to the previous workflow we discussed combined with two other branches — the release branch and the hot-fix branch.</p><h3 id="the-hot-fix-branch">The hot-fix branch</h3><p>The hot-fix branch is the only branch that is created from the master branch and directly merged to the master branch instead of the develop branch. It is used only when you have to quickly patch a production issue. An advantage of this branch is, it allows you to quickly deploy a production issue without disrupting others’ workflow or without having to wait for the next release cycle.</p><p>Once the fix is merged into the master branch and deployed, it should be merged into both develop and the current release branch. This is done to ensure that anyone who forks off develop to create a new feature branch has the latest code.</p><h3 id="the-release-branch">The release branch</h3><p>The release branch is forked off of develop branch after the develop branch has all the features planned for the release merged into it successfully.</p><p>No code related to new features is added into the release branch. Only code that relates the release is added to the release branch. For example, documentation, bug fixes, and other tasks related to this release are added to this branch.</p><p>Once this branch is merged with master and deployed to production, it’s also merged back into the develop branch, so that when a new feature is forked off of develop, it has the latest code.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/GitFlow-git-workflow-2.png" alt="Gitflow workflow"><figcaption>Gitflow workflow with hotfix and release branches</figcaption></figure><p>This workflow was first published and made popular by <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen</a> and since then it has been widely used by organizations that have a scheduled release cycle.</p><p>Since the git-flow is a wrapper around Git, you can install git-flow in your current repository. It's a straightforward process and it doesn't change anything in your repository other than creating branches for you. </p><p>To install on a Mac machine, execute <code>brew install git-flow</code> in your terminal.</p><p>To install on a Windows machine, you'll need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">download and install the git-flow</a>. After the installation is done, run <code>git flow init</code> to use it in your project.</p><h2 id="5-git-fork-workflow">5. Git Fork Workflow</h2><p>The Fork workflow is popular among teams who use open-source software.</p><p>The flow usually looks like this:</p><ol><li>The developer forks the open-source software’s official repository. A copy of this repository is created in their account.</li><li>The developer then clones the repository from their account to their local system.</li><li>A remote path for the official repository is added to the repository that is cloned to the local system.</li><li>The developer creates a new feature branch is created in their local system, makes changes, and commits them.</li><li>These changes along with the branch are pushed to the developer’s copy of the repository on their account.</li><li>A pull request from the branch is opened to the official repository.</li><li>The official repository’s manager checks the changes and approves the changes to get merged into the official repository.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="automating-your-git-workflows-for-better-productivity">Automating your Git Workflows for better productivity</h2><p>One of the things that developers have to constantly juggle with is updating their project management tool to keep their teammates updated. That’s why, at Zepel, our developers automate their workflow, so they can spend more of their time building the software.</p><p>Here’s how we automate our git workflow to keep everyone in sync:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/zepel-git-developer-workflow.png" alt="Developer Workflow with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack Integrations"><figcaption>A simple flowchart of how developer workflow is automated with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack</figcaption></figure><p>While Zepel integrates deeply with <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/github/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/bitbucket/">Bitbucket</a>, and <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/gitlab/">GitLab</a>, we use GitHub internally. So, once we’ve integrated GitHub with Zepel, our development team sets up the git workflow automation within Zepel. Here’s how it looks today:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/01/zepel-git-workflow-automation.png" alt="Git workflow automation"><figcaption>Automating Zepel to update statuses based on Git workflow.</figcaption></figure><p>As developers continue to make progress, our team automatically gets a Slack notification and their changes are recorded within the user story.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/image.png" alt="Git workflow updates to user story in real-time"><figcaption>Real-time updates on every commit, pull request, and branch changes.</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="your-own-workflow-">Your own workflow!</h2><p>The git workflows I’ve shown in this article are examples of some of the popular and best working workflows for the development team. Some teams create a branch for Staging and it works perfectly for them.</p><p>If you use other workflows that work well for you, tweet to us <a href="https://twitter.com/@getzepel">@getzepel</a>. We’d love to showcase them!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://zepel.io/?open_modal=true&amp;utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=bottom-cta&amp;utm_campaign=git-workflow"><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-template-cta.png" alt="development workflow cta button"></a></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>If you read a description of a static analysis in a paper, what might you find? There’ll be some cute model of a language. Maybe some inference rules describing the analysis itself, but those rules probably rely on a variety of helper functions. These days, the analysis likely involves some logical reasoning: about the terms in the language, the branches conditionals might take, and so on.</p>



<p>What makes a language good for implementing such an analysis? You’d want a variety of features:</p>



<ul><li>Algebraic data types to model the language AST.</li><li>Logic programming for cleanly specifying inference rules.</li><li>Pure functional code for writing the helper functions.</li><li>An SMT solver for answering logical queries.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~bembenek/">Aaron Bembenek</a>, <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Steve Chong</a>, and I have developed a design that hits the sweet spot of those four points: given Datalog as a core, you add constructors, pure ML, and a type-safe interface to SMT. If you set things up just right, the system is a powerful and ergonomic way to write static analyses.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog">Formulog</a> is our prototype implementation of our design; our <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">paper on Formulog and its design</a> was just conditionally accepted to <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-oopsla">OOPSLA 2020</a>. To give a sense of why I’m excited, let me excerpt from our <a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog/blob/master/examples/liquid_types.flg">simple liquid type checker</a>. Weighing in under 400 very short lines, it’s a nice showcase of how expressive Formulog is. (Our paper discusses substantially more complex examples.)</p>



<pre>type base =
&nbsp;&nbsp;| base_bool

type typ = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_tvar(tvar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_fun(var, typ, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_forall(tvar, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_ref(var, base, exp)

and exp = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(var)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(bool)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(op)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(var, typ, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(tvar, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(exp, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(exp, typ)
</pre>



<p>ADTs let you define your AST in a straightforward way. Here, <code>bool</code> is our only base type, but we could add more. Let’s look at some of the inference rules:</p>



<pre>(* subtyping *)
output sub(ctx, typ, typ)

(* bidirectional typing rules *)
output synth(ctx, exp, typ)
output check(ctx, exp, typ)

(* subtyping between refinement types is implication *)
sub(G, typ_ref(X, B, E1), typ_ref(Y, B, E2)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_ctx(G),
&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_subst(Y, exp_var(X), E2) = E2prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_ctx(G, PhiG),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E1, Phi1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E2prime, Phi2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_valid(`PhiG /\ Phi1 ==&gt; Phi2`).

(* lambda and application synth rules *)
synth(G, exp_lam(X, T1, E), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_typ(G, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(ctx_var(G, X, T1), E, T2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_fun(X, T1, T2) = T.

synth(G, exp_app(E1, E2), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E1, typ_fun(X, T1, T2)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;check(G, E2, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E2, T2) = T.

(* the only checking rule *)
check(G, E, T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E, Tprime),
&nbsp;&nbsp;sub(G, Tprime, T).</pre>



<p>First, we declare our relations—that is, the (typed) inference rules we’ll be using. We show the most interesting case of subtyping: refinement implication. Several helper relations (<code>wf_ctx</code>, <code>encode_*</code>) and helper functions (<code>exp_subst</code>) patch things together. The typing rules below follow a similar pattern, mixing the <code>synth</code> and <code>check</code> bidirectional typing relations with calls to helper functions like <code>typ_subst</code>.</p>



<pre>fun exp_subst(X: var, E : exp, Etgt : exp) : exp =
&nbsp;&nbsp;match Etgt with
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(Y) =&gt; if X = Y then E else Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(Y, Tlam, Elam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Yfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh_for(Y, X::append(typ_freevars(Tlam), exp_freevars(Elam)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Elamfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y = Yfresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Elam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else exp_subst(Y, exp_var(Yfresh), Elam)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_lam(Yfresh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E, Tlam),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elamfresh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(A, Etlam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tlam(A, exp_subst(X, E, Etlam))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(E1, E2) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_app(exp_subst(X, E, E1), exp_subst(X, E, E2))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(Etapp, T) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tapp(exp_subst(X, E, Etapp), typ_subst(X, E, T))
&nbsp;&nbsp;end</pre>



<p>Expression substitution might be boring, but it shows the ML fragment well enough. It’s more or less the usual ML, though functions need to have pure interfaces, and we have a few restrictions in place to keep typing simple in our prototype.</p>



<p>There’s lots of fun stuff that doesn’t make it into this example: not only can relations call functions, but functions can examine relations (so long as everything is stratified). Hiding inside <code>fresh_for</code> is a clever approach to name generation that guarantees freshness… but is also deterministic and won’t interfere with parallel execution. The <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> has more substantial examples.</p>



<p>We’re not the first to combine logic programming and SMT. What makes our design a sweet spot is that it doesn’t let SMT get in the way of Datalog’s straightforward and powerful execution model. Datalog execution is readily parallelizable; the magic sets transformation can turn Datalog’s exhaustive, bottom-up search into a goal-directed one. It’s not news that Datalog can turn these tricks—<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop/src/master/">Yiannis Smaragdakis has been saying it for years</a>!—but integrating Datalog cleanly with ML functions and SMT is new. Check out the <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> for a detailed related work comparison. While our design is, in the end, not so complicated, getting there was hard.</p>



<p>Relatedly, we have also have an <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/iclp2020_extabs.pdf">extended abstract at ICLP 2020</a>, detailing some experiments in using incremental solving modes from Formulog. You might worry that Datalog’s BFS (or heuristic) strategy wouldn’t work with an SMT solver’s push/pop (i.e., DFS) assertion stack—but a few implementation tricks and <code>check-sat-assuming</code> indeed provide speedups.</p>

<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_8b0a23dc03d84943adf8be09b08014a6/_image_cache/27c93597-70c8-465e-b77b-5b2eba72b047.jpg" width="640" height="427" data-action="zoom"></p>
<p>I was talking to a friend and recounting my experiences building multiple SaaS startups and why SaaS is generally a tough nut to break into. While I was talking to her, I started asking myself with the benefit of hindsight<span></span> <span>“</span>What would I do differently the next time?”. Here are a couple of things I would have done differently, irrespective of what I was building.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-the-price">Start with the price:</h2>
<p>This was the top-most thing that came to my mind when I asked that question, for a good reason. Price influences many things: Your customer segments, your retention, sales and renewal cycles and most importantly MRR/ARR. If you price something too high, you will need to come up with a significant differentiation w.r.t your lower priced competition. If you price something too low, you will need to go through motions of raising the prices slightly and risk drawing ire from your early users. What about Freemium? Better have a good reason for doing so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research, experiment and choose your price carefully!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="choose-who-you-let-in-and-out">Choose who you let in and out:</h2>
<p>Understanding and mapping this audience will help you understand how they influence your Sales and Product strategy. There are three major buckets you can divide your SaaS customers into: Significant Gainers, Outsourcers and Underserved segments. Significant Gainers are the accounts who will end up as a net-net <span>ROI</span> gainers. Outsourcers are typically large accounts &amp; have a good mapping with your offerings, they may end up outsourcing all of their headaches on to you. Underserved accounts are not completely sold by your offerings or there is a good lapse in the expectation, price or (worse) their <span>ROI</span>. It’s always a good idea to try and balance all of them in a way that you don’t become a service shop for your top 10-20% accounts and under-satisfy the rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to map the <span>ROI</span>, their impact on your revenue and roadmaps before you onboard accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="break-down-the-journeys-and-map-them-to-specific-stakeholders">Break down the journeys and map them to specific stakeholders:</h2>
<p>Break the journeys down and map them to specific stakeholders. If you want to onboard accounts where the annual ticket sizes are more than 25K$+ spend some time here. Acquisitions of large accounts typically have four specific journeys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested/ Chase me,</li>
<li>Want to Evaluate,</li>
<li>Procurement,</li>
<li>Onboard Me (&amp; my problems).</li>
</ul>
<p>At every step of the way you will meet different POCs/Teams handholding &amp; influencing the specific journeys. Understand how other deals have gone through these stages and make it brain-dead simple. It seems obvious but in retrospect, this is mostly an after-thought and not the first thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimize to get to<span></span> <span>“</span>I need this now”,<span></span> <span>“</span>This looks good” and<span></span> <span>“</span>This is approved” mails as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="have-exit-interviews-at-both-evaluations-and-churned-stages.">Have exit interviews at both Evaluations and Churned stages.:</h2>
<p>When you build a tool that solves (one or more) problem(s), understand that there are a number of possible solutions. Understanding the market’s expectations continually can only happen if you ingest valid feedback at proper places. The most significant places are: Whenever demos/pitches happen, and whenever someone churns. Pitches are akin to coffee dates, sometimes they just don’t work out. Be prepared to get all sorts of feedback if done right. Existing accounts are like married couples and as with every failed marriage, the reasons are typically a mismatch in expectations or not being respected in the relationship. Try to solve for this before the dwindling bottom funnel becomes a problem!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Failed expectations typically end up in churns, so avoid it like the plague.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="have-strong-opinions-weakly-held">Have strong opinions weakly held:</h2>
<p>Intuition and Opinions will rarely ever take you far along the right path. Everyone (including me) has an opinion on making things work and building something. That doesn’t mean whatever works for you is wrong, learn to differentiate between signal and noise. But always remember when the map doesn’t match the territory the map is wrong. I wish I had listened to customers more than thought leaders and filtered signals from various noises. Be open to change at every step of the way - it’s the only way to grow. Look (upto) at companies that disrupt themselves or cannibalise themselves, as they can teach you a lot. Nothing is truly one-size fits all!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you make the same mistake twice, it’s not a mistake anymore, but a <a href="mailto:f@#kup">f@#kup</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is mostly a collection of stuff I messed up on, that doesn’t mean there will be a 1-1 mapping with whatever you are doing. Remember to have fun while building, &amp; ship stuff you are proud of!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>P.S: I would love to know more about what you think about the same? Also thanks to Bhavya for reviewing and suggesting edits to the early drafts for this post.</p>

<p><em>India’s first lunar mission, Chandrayaan 1, <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">confirmed the presence</a> of water on the Moon. It was a groundbreaking achievement for its Mission Director, Srinivasa Hegde, who worked at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for 36 years, from 1978 to 2014. At&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/u-r-rao-satellite-centre-ursc" target="_blank">ISRO’s Satellite Center</a> in Bangalore, he was involved in planning, analysis and operations for dozens of space missions.</em></p>



<p><em>I interviewed him for Supercluster on his role as Mission Director for Chandrayaan 1 and India’s future in space. The responses have been edited for clarity and some links and images have been added for the reader’s benefit.</em></p>



<hr>



<h5><strong>What first got you interested in space exploration?</strong></h5>



<p>As a kid, I was influenced by my grandfather. He was a Sanskrit scholar and an astrologer, with a love for stars in the sky. He used to take me for early morning walks before dawn. During those days of reduced pollution, many constellations were clearly visible. He used to identify and explain all the constellations to me and I was intrigued. Besides, I was generally interested in science and reading up on new discoveries and happenings in the field. Then one day I came across a job opening at ISRO for which I applied and got selected.</p>



<h5><strong><strong>Chandrayaan 1 was the first time India explored another world. What were the early stages of its conception like at ISRO?</strong></strong></h5>



<p>Dr. K. Kasturirangan, who chaired ISRO from 1994 to 2003, wanted the organization to play a small role in India’s ambition to become a superpower. This planted the seed for undertaking more ambitious missions. The idea of a Moon orbiter was floated around and was received positively by everyone.</p>



<p>At the time, ISRO already had satellites intended for geostationary applications which have plenty of fuel. So the basic infrastructure was ready and the only delta required was adapting it to the Moon. Initial calculations showed that our PSLV rocket was capable of giving an Earth-bound orbit beyond which the fuel on the spacecraft could be used to go to the Moon and perform orbital capture. In all, Chandrayaan 1 seemed like a logical extension of our capabilities.</p>



<h5><strong>What did your role as Chandrayaan 1’s Mission Director involve and what was your biggest challenge?</strong></h5>



<p>I was involved in all aspects of the Mission Design – the design of the various orbits, data management, orbit determination, strategies for mid-course corrections, etc. and also in aspects of operating the spacecraft.</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 was the first ISRO project to involve many foreigners who had their scientific instruments onboard. As Mission Director, I was tasked with accommodating their needs. It posed challenges because they had diverse requirements.</p>



<p>For instance, scientists behind the Mini-SAR payload wanted to calibrate the instrument when the spacecraft would be en-route to the Moon. They were unhappy with the fact that we couldn’t accommodate that due to certain changes in our launch schedule. However, at a later stage we provided them with a geometry in lunar orbit for calibration which they said was even better than what they originally asked for.</p>



<h5><strong>Was finding water on the Moon a primary scientific objective during the planning of Chandrayaan 1? Why was it important?</strong></h5>



<p>Absolutely. NASA missions to the Moon in the past decade had already hinted at the possibility of water ice being trapped in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon. So it was crucial to confirm its presence as it has implications for future human settlements as well as getting insights on <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>.</p>



<h5><strong>For Chandrayaan 1, ISRO solicited scientific instruments from other space agencies around the world. What was the driving philosophy behind that?</strong></h5>



<p>We had our own science payloads on Chandrayaan 1 but given the renewed global interest in the Moon after so many decades, we also wanted to provide the spacecraft as a platform for others. And so ISRO put out an announcement of opportunity to scientists all over the world to pitch payloads for Chandrayaan 1. We got instruments from ESA as well as NASA, including Universities associated with them. I think the timing of Chandrayaan 1 was good as NASA’s next Moon mapper, LRO, was still a year away.</p>



<h5><strong>Tell us about the <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water</a> on the Moon by the NASA instruments onboard Chandrayaan 1 and more on the India-USA partnership.</strong></h5>



<p>As discussed, NASA scientists were really interested in putting their instruments on Chandrayaan 1 and working with us to confirm the presence of water. The discovery ultimately came from two NASA-built instruments – the Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) and the Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3).</p>



<p>Mini-SAR <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">found</a> that more than 40 craters on the lunar poles reflected signals in patterns consistent with water ice. However, there was still some uncertainty like in previous missions about the detections really being water ice.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/c2356-mini-sar-finds-water-ice.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Likely water ice on the Moon’s north pole (marked by green circles) found by Chandrayaan 1 instrument Mini-SAR. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It was the M3 instrument that <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">confirmed</a> water ice being present in the polar craters based on how the surface absorbed infrared light. In fact, M3 detected water and hydroxyl molecules almost everywhere on the Moon. Scientists now knew for the first time that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water even in the non-polar regions.</p>

<p>The India-USA partnership on Chandrayaan 1 also extended to NASA providing us access to its iconic Deep Space Network which was used for communications with the spacecraft.</p>



<h5><strong>What was the most challenging scenario when operating Chandrayaan 1 in lunar orbit?</strong></h5>



<p>Oh, this is my favorite part! Chandrayaan 1 actually managed to view a solar eclipse from the Moon! We were able to see the Moon’s shadow cast on Earth. In 2009, a year after launch, both the star sensors onboard the spacecraft had failed. With that, the spacecraft lost its ability to precisely point to a desired attitude in space. A mission failure was looming.</p>



<p>Instead of losing the craft, we came up with a solution that involved using the Sun sensors to get knowledge of two spatial axes and take aid from the ground station to know the third. This data was utilized by the onboard gyroscopes to be able to point the spacecraft again with reasonable accuracy. The mission was back up and running.</p>



<p>As the spacecraft passed between the Moon and Earth in its lunar orbit on July 22, 2009, it imaged the Moon’s shadow cast on our planet. This was a first for any lunar mission and completely executed when the spacecraft was in a non-nominal state.</p>

Images credit: ISRO, GIF: Jatan Mehta</figcaption></figure></div>



<h5><strong>Do you think there’s enough water on the Moon’s poles to power large human settlements in the future?</strong></h5>



<p>It’s too early to comment but going by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">amount estimated</a> from Chandrayaan 1 Mini-SAR observations, it seems there could be enough. Chandrayaan 2’s orbiter can tell us more details about it.</p>



<h5><strong>How is the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter positioned to provide us more insights on water on the Moon?</strong></h5>



<p>The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter has <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/chandrayaan2-payloads">upgraded instruments</a>. It’s infrared spectrometer will build a global, high-resolution map of water concentrations in the lunar soil and how the amount changes in response to the lunar environment.</p>



<p>The upgraded radar, that can penetrate deeper, will map the water ice trapped in the lunar poles and quantify its amount, something no one has adequately done yet.</p>



<h5><strong>How can India compete with China and the USA in the renewed Moon race?</strong></h5>



<p>It is difficult as both these nations have enormous resources. But the spectrum of science that can be done on the Moon is vast and our strategy has been to fill crucial gaps in our current understanding, like the discovery of water.</p>



<h5><strong>Which planetary destination do you think India should aim for next and why?</strong></h5>



<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It&nbsp;is mostly covered with fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies in the Solar System and is known to host water underneath that icy surface. After Cassini spacecraft’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-organic-compounds-found-in-enceladus-ice-grains">discovery of organic compounds</a> in Enceladus’ plumes, it has become, to me, by far the most interesting object in the Solar System.</p>



<h5><strong>What does having a planetary exploration program mean for a country like India?</strong></h5>



<p>It plays an important role in eventual settlement of space. Doing such missions means we gain new capabilities and experiences, all of which give us a good starting point for future endeavors. For instance, the most notable thing in Chandrayaan 2 is that all of its cutting-edge scientific instruments are designed and built indigenously.</p>



<h5><strong>What are your thoughts on India sending its own astronauts to space, aka the Gaganyaan program?</strong></h5>



<p>Sending humans to space involves too many challenges, like ruggedization of the spacecraft and launcher, having enough fuel at all stages, complex trajectories, multi-layered redundancy in spacecraft functions, etc. At every stage, there should be a means to get back humans safely and there is little to no tolerance for failure. With all those requirements, Gaganyaan is certainly a very expensive undertaking. But it has to be done sooner or later for space settlement, so why not now?</p>



<h5><strong>Throughout your career at ISRO, how have you seen the landscape for women in STEM change?</strong></h5>



<p>There are many <a href="https://jatan.space/book-review-those-magnificent-women-and-their-stories/">women at ISRO</a> who are capable and doing exceptional work. Over the years they have rightly assumed increasingly higher and more versatile positions inside ISRO’s various missions and centers. This includes women who aren’t necessarily photogenic and don’t feel the need to be in the limelight.</p>



<h5><strong>Should humanity establish permanent presence on the Moon first or Mars?</strong></h5>

<![CDATA[The wrong way to filter sockets with BPF]]>
            </title>

August 8, 2020 | https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Here is a bug that everyone who uses BPF to filter packets on Linux eventually encounters:  you create a socket, use setsockopt to apply a BPF, and then read from the socket using recv. You read a packet that does <strong>not</strong> match the filter but was received from the socket anyway. The bug only happens when there is a lot of traffic and even then it only occurs when the application first starts. What is happening?</p>

<p>Here is some code which suffers from this issue. Error-handling has been removed for conciseness:</p>

<pre><code>int sock = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL));

struct sock_filter bpf_bytecode[] = { ... }; // bytecode generated by hand or using "tcpdump -dd"
struct sock_fprog bpf_program = { sizeof(bpf_bytecode) / sizeof(bpf_bytecode[0]), bpf_bytecode};
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));

char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will sometimes contain a packet that doesn't match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>The bug here is deceptively simple: Packets are filtered when they are received by the kernel <strong>not</strong> when they are read by user-mode using recv. Therefore packets which don’t match the BPF can be received after the socket is created and before setsockopt is called. Those packets will remain in the socket’s buffer even after the BPF is applied and will later be transferred to the application via recv.</p>

<p>Here are two <strong>wrong</strong> ways to fix this:</p>

<ol>
<li>After applying the bpf use recv in a loop to discard packets from the socket until it is empty. This typically works but it breaks down if the traffic rate is greater than the rate at which you can discard packets. (e.g. if you’re sniffing on a very high traffic machine and your app typically loses packets when the socket’s buffer fills but it doesn’t matter for your use-case.) In this case your attempt to empty the socket will turn into an infinite loop.</li>
<li>Add user-mode checks that duplicate the BPF’s logic and check all packets after receiving them. Duplicate logic leads to bugs. Enough said.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Now lets look at the textbook solution for fixing this bug - the same solution that <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/f4fcc9396dc425399846cf082f9ed1056b81dd11/pcap-linux.c#L6096">libpcap uses</a>:</p>

<pre><code>struct sock_filter zero_bytecode = BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, 0);
struct sock_fprog zero_program = { 1, &amp;zero_bytecode};

if (setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;zero_program, sizeof(zero_program)) &lt; 0) {
	printf("error attaching zero bpf: %d\n", errno);
	return 1;
}

char drain[1];
while (1) {
	int bytes = recv(sock, drain, sizeof(drain), MSG_DONTWAIT);
	if (bytes == -1) {
		// we assume the error here means there is nothing left to read from the socket which is exactly what we want
		break;
	}
}

// bpf_program is the actual bpf program we want to apply - just like in the previous example
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));
char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will now always match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>What we’re doing here is taking advantage of the fact that swapping one BPF out for another is an atomic operation: if you swap one BPF for another then at every moment either the first is in place or the second but never neither. We therefore start by applying the so-called “zero-BPF” which is a BPF that matches no packets. Then we empty out any packets that arrived before the “zero-BPF” filter was applied. At this point the socket is definitely empty and it can’t fill up with junk because the zero-BPF is in place. Then we replace the zero-BPF with the real BPF we want. Because the swap is atomic we know that any packet in the socket after that must match the real BPF.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

    <p>High performing teams thrive on accountability. Accountability is the foundation for a culture that gets stuff done: if you say you’ll do something, we all trust that it will happen. Accountability is empowering, creates great opportunities for learning, and allows the company to move faster. You can’t succeed in a competitive environment without it.</p>

<p>The more complex your organization, the more elusive accountability becomes. Startups foster learning because they’re high-accountability arenas: it’s immediately obvious when Bob isn’t towing the line. As a company scales, accountability easily gets lost if ownership isn’t well-defined and outcomes aren’t immediately observable. When things go well, people claim any victory that occurred in their area code as their own. When they go poorly, people skitter away to dusty corners of the org chart or just make excuses. This leads to a vicious cycle of eroding trust, heavyweight management processes, and disempowerment.</p>

<p>Eventually, when enough balls get dropped, leadership makes big, all-or-nothing decisions that either abandon accountability altogether or are overly harsh. The senior people in the vicinity of a big win get promoted. People find scapegoats. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid this inevitable landmine? Get high-quality accountability from transparency.</p>

<h2 id="why-transparency-works">Why Transparency Works</h2>

<p>The first reason that transparency leads to accountability: <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/we-work-harder-when-we-know-someones-watching">people rise to the occasion when they know they have an audience</a>, and transparency gives your team a front row seat to the action. Put another way, people (generally) don’t want to publicly screw up. The light peer pressure of transparency immediately delivers results.</p>

<p>On healthy teams, people want to see their teammates succeed and will lend a hand if they see something falling off-track. But most people don’t want to go to their teammates with some form of “hey, it looks like you’re screwing up.” Transparency lowers the friction involved in asking or offering help.</p>

<p>Transparency also gives you observability well before the train flies off the tracks. Imagine the conversations below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Hey Bob, at the last 2 standups you said you were planning to get to Project X next. Still on-track for launch on the first of the month? Let me know if there are blockers I can help with, or if we should discuss whether it even still makes sense as a priority.”</li>
  <li>“Hey Bob, why did X not get done? We had planned for it to be done by the first of the month. What happened?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these conversations will get you to accountability, but the former conversation is infinitely easier. It’s early, and there is time to get help or adjust plans. There’s also still room for nuance – does it still make sense to spend our time here at all? By contrast, the latter conversation is an adversarial nightmare and almost guaranteed to elicit a defensive reaction. Transparency allows you to aim small, and therefore miss small.</p>

<p>Finally, if a project truly does fail, transparency helps you address it correctly and fairly.</p>

<p>There’s usually a pretty reasonable explanation when things go wrong. Were our goals unrealistic? Did other priorities get in the way? Did some exogenous factor throw a wrench into our plans? Or, are we in the (relatively uncommon) situation where someone was simply lazy or incompetent? As a manager, you owe it to your team to have a nuanced response to what is almost certainly a nuanced situation.</p>

<p>Transparency gives you a clear trail to understand and take action – which is the bedrock upon which true accountability rests. Trying to get accountability without transparency is like doing brain surgery with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-achieve-transparency">How to Achieve Transparency</h2>

<p>You can achieve transparency through a variety of methods, all centered around tracking true indicators of productivity or progress towards goals.</p>

<p>Tools for transparency should be neutral, objective, and predictable – think of metrics dashboards or a weekly team check-in, rather than a manager nosing in and asking for a status report on a whim. The best forms of transparency are impersonal as they’re rooted in facts and data, not opinions and explanations. They should be at least semi-public: shared between a manager and report, with a team, or with the entire company. And most importantly, transparency efforts must be lightweight: the benefit of more transparency is increased accountability and observability without a decrease in velocity.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite lightweight ways to get more transparency are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make business metrics that you care about public to the company, and automatically publish them to an email list / public chat channel at a regular cadence. For example, create a public Slack channel in which you post metrics such as renewal rate, number of news signups, or number of support tickets per active user once a month.</li>
  <li>Use standups (of any form – live or virtual) to keep projects on track. The key is to follow up on hurdles that have blocked progress for some time as soon as things are off track – standup should be an active listening exercise.</li>
  <li>It’s easy for the “last 10%” of projects to take as much time to complete as the first 90%. As you’re approaching the end of a project, teams should track their current best guess for when a project will go live.</li>
  <li>On a quarterly basis, send everyone in the organization an anonymous poll rating their current job satisfaction on a few key dimensions, and have the CEO / other executives follow up with the heads of large functional groups that report to them.</li>
  <li>For any complex and sensitive business-critical process (e.g. deploying risky code or launching new products to customers), set up a checkin meeting to talk about all upcoming launches. The existence of the public checkin is a strong forcing function for people to run a tight ship.</li>
  <li>If you use an Agile system with sprints, track metrics such as points completed per sprint, average time that stories have been in-progress, or percentage of sprints in which all work is completed.</li>
</ul>

I thought there must be a catch, something complicated that I was missing. But no, it just worked.</p><p id="b626">An additional bonus is that you get the chrome dev tools to help debug any issues or adjust the layout. Also, I love the use of JS promises to implement the async calls between Go and JS, given I have been writing about promises <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/jquery-promises-and-deferreds-i-promise-this-will-be-short-d10275f82717">since 2014</a>.</p><p id="f0ee">The big downside to Lorca is that because it uses Chrome, some application details (like the system menu, icon, title) cannot be customized. The tradeoff is then between application polish and a simple application. Depending on what you are trying to build this might be a deal-breaker, e.g. it would be fine if you are building an internal tool, but for an enterprise application this might not look great.</p><h2 id="872d">Webview</h2><p id="2a63"><a href="https://github.com/webview/webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webview</a> is a library that helps building a web app directly on top of a native components. The code to do this looks like:</p><pre><span id="ab1e">func main() {<br> w := webview.New(true)<br> defer w.Destroy()</span><span id="cc4a"> w.SetSize(600, 200, webview.HintNone)</span><span id="c720"> // Create a GoLang function callable from JS<br> w.Bind("hello", func() string { return "World!" })<p>  // Create UI with data URI <br> w.Navigate(`data:text/html,<br>  &lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>  &lt;html&gt;<br>   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br>   &lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;<br>   &lt;script&gt; hello().then((x) =&gt; { console.log(x) }) &lt;/script&gt;<br>  &lt;/html&gt;`)</p><p>   w.Run()<br>}</p></span></pre><p id="9d61">This is very similar API to Lorca, which I assumed was based on webview. Though unlike Lorca, the output is a bit different:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1598/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png" width="799" height="488" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="0129">You can see the in the above screen shot the webview application window has no drop shadow, has no border, and it is initialized in the bottom left corner of the screen. This can be customized through the <code>Window</code> method that returns an <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> to the OS dependent window object (<code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSWindow</a></code> in macOS). <strong>This is where the difficulty begins.</strong></p><p id="e6e1">To work with the <code>Window</code> object we must write binding from Go to the native component. For example, if we wanted our window to start centered, we would call <code>center</code> on the <code>NSWindow</code>. So we need to write a binding in three files (adapted from <a href="https://github.com/alediaferia/gogoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gogoa</a>):</p><p id="394b"><code><strong>ns_window.go</strong></code></p><pre><span id="d817">package main<br>// #cgo CFLAGS: -x objective-c<br>// #cgo LDFLAGS: -framework Cocoa<br>//#include "ns_window.h"<br>import "C"<br>import "unsafe"<br>type NSWindow struct {<br> ptr unsafe.Pointer<br>}<br>func (self *NSWindow) Center() {<br> C.Center(self.ptr)<br>}</span></pre><p id="d8b2"><code><strong>ns_window.h</strong></code></p><pre><span id="39df">#include &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;<br>void Center(void *);</span></pre><p id="7e6b"><code><strong>ns_window.m</strong></code></p><pre><span id="a7b8">#include "ns_window.h"<br>void Center(void *self) {<br>  NSWindow *window = self;<br>  [window center];<br>}</span></pre><p id="0968">Then in the <code>main()</code> function we can center the window with:</p><pre><span id="84b9">window := NSWindow{w.Window()}<br>window.Center()</span></pre><p id="5ba1">Unlike Lorca, webview can be fully customized for our application. The problem is that it requires a bit of work.</p><p id="ebec">There are a few other parts of webview that make working with it a bit difficult:</p><ol><li id="2bac">If using Bazel and gazelle, <code>webview</code>'s generated <code>Build.bazel</code> file is incorrect and <code>clinkopts = [“-framework WebKit”]</code> must be patched.</li><li id="0eb2">Calling <code>w.Init</code> only works when <code>w.Navigate</code> is called, but then the <code>w.Eval</code> calls stop working.</li><li id="bb2a">To set the title you could write a binding as described above, or you have to use the <code>Dispatch</code> method e.g. <code>w.Dispatch(func() { w.SetTitle("Title") })</code>. This is incorrect in the provided examples.</li></ol><p id="7998">I am not sure how much of this is <code>webview</code> and how much is <code>NSWindow</code>. More investigation and learning on my part should make it clearer why these things are happening.</p><h2 id="26f6">Electron</h2><p id="994d">My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/building-an-electron-app-with-bazel-d124ed550957">previous post</a> was about building a simple Electron app that looks like:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1422/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png" width="711" height="291" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="e89d">Electron is used in many large products like VSCode. This is probably because bundling everything into a single application makes portability much simpler and applications can be extensively customized. The downside of bundling the app with a browser and Node.js is that it makes the distribution <strong>very large.</strong></p><p id="d4c0">Getting Golang to play with Electron is also a bit difficult. There are frameworks that make this easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-astilectron</a>, but these are complicated and mostly feature incomplete. Another way might be to use Golang compiled to WASM, which I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341">wrote about before</a>, but this is also not a simple solution.</p><p id="dba6">The benefits of Electron are that it is portable, customizable, and battle tested for application distribution. It is just a bit complicated with Golang.</p><h2 id="83a0">Comparison</h2><p id="b25a">I think the main comparison to be made is customizability vs. simplicity. Lorca is by far the simplest with very limited customizability, webview can be fully customized with some difficulty, and Electron is fully customizable but difficult to use with Golang.</p><p id="ab93">Also the size of the bundle is very different between the frameworks; Lorca has a <strong>8.7 MB </strong>binary, webview <strong>3.7Mb</strong>, and Electron a <strong>157Mb</strong> bundle size. <br>The debugging tools also vary: Lorca and Electron use the Chrome dev tools, where webview uses the Safari dev tools.</p><h2 id="b79a">Conclusion:</h2><p id="987c">Both Lorca and webview work well with Golang, have small distribution sizes, and similar APIs. The main difference is between the underlying renderer being native and debug tooling.</p><p id="2e1d">Electron I think is probably too complicated to use with Golang without a lot of difficulty.</p><p id="8e32">A potential workflow is to use Lorca during development and webview for distribution. Lorca provides familiar tooling for debugging and development, where webview provides the customizability for distribution. Lorca would also be a nice backup as a means of cross-compilation to other operating systems that webview does not support.</p><p id="4108"><em>Note: there are still more options like </em><code><a href="https://github.com/wailsapp/wails" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>wails</em></a></code><em> or </em><code><a href="https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>gotk</em></a></code><em> that can provide other means to build/distribute apps.</em></p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

  <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates network architecture engineering. It aims to learn a network topology that can achieve best performance on a certain task. By dissecting the methods for NAS into three components: search space, search algorithm and child model evolution strategy, this post reviews many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient automatic neural architecture search.</p>

<p>Although most popular and successful model architectures are designed by human experts, it doesn’t mean we have explored the entire network architecture space and settled down with the best option. We would have a better chance to find the optimal solution if we adopt a systematic and automatic way of learning high-performance model architectures.</p>

<p>Automatically learning and evolving network topologies is not a new idea (<a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">Stanley &amp; Miikkulainen, 2002</a>). In recent years, the pioneering work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> has attracted a lot of attention into the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), leading to many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient NAS methods.</p>

<p>As I started looking into NAS, I found this nice survey very helpful by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al 2019</a>. They characterize NAS as a system with three major components, which is clean &amp; concise, and also commonly adopted in other NAS papers.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Search space</strong>: The NAS search space defines a set of operations (e.g. convolution, fully-connected, pooling) and how operations can be connected to form valid network architectures. The design of search space usually involves human expertise, as well as unavoidably human biases.</li>
  <li><strong>Search algorithm</strong>: A NAS search algorithm samples a population of network architecture candidates. It receives the child model performance metrics as rewards (e.g. high accuracy, low latency) and optimizes to generate high-performance architecture candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation strategy</strong>: We need to measure, estimate, or predict the performance of a large number of proposed child models in order to obtain feedback for the search algorithm to learn. The process of candidate evaluation could be very expensive and many new methods have been proposed to save time or computation resources.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-high-level.png" alt="High-level categorization of NAS"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Three main components of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) models.  (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al. 2019</a> with customized annotation in red)</em></p>



<h2 id="search-space">Search Space</h2>

<p>The NAS search space defines a set of basic network operations and how operations can be connected to construct valid network architectures.</p>

<h3 id="sequential-layer-wise-operations">Sequential Layer-wise Operations</h3>

<p>The most naive way to design the search space for neural network architectures is to depict network topologies, either CNN or RNN, with a list of <em>sequential layer-wise operations</em>, as seen in the early work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a>. The serialization of network representation requires a decent amount of expert knowledge, since each operation is associated with different layer-specific parameters and such associations need to be hardcoded. For example, after predicting a <code>conv</code> op, the model should output kernel size, stride size, etc; or after predicting an <code>FC</code> op, we need to see the number of units as the next prediction.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-search-space.png" alt="The sequential layer-wise operation search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. (Top) A sequential representation of CNN. (Bottom) A sequential representation of the tree structure of a recurrent cell. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To make sure the generated architecture is valid, additional rules might be needed (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a layer is not connected to any input layer then it is used as the input layer;</li>
  <li>At the final layer, take all layer outputs that have not been connected and concatenate them;</li>
  <li>If one layer has many input layers, then all input layers are concatenated in the depth dimension;</li>
  <li>If input layers to be concatenated have different sizes, we pad the small layers with zeros so that the concatenated layers have the same sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skip connection can be predicted as well, using an <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log%20/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html">attention</a>-style mechanism. At layer \(i\) , an anchor point is added with \(i−1\) content-based sigmoids to indicate which of the previous layers to be connected. Each sigmoid takes as input the hidden states of the current node \(h_i\) and \(i-1\) previous nodes \(h_j, j=1, \dots, i-1\) .</p><p>

\[P(\text{Layer j is an input to layer i}) = \text{sigmoid}(v^\top \tanh(\mathbf{W}_\text{prev} h_j + \mathbf{W}_\text{curr} h_i))\]

</p><p>The sequential search space has a lot of representation power, but it is very large and consumes a ton of computation resources to exhaustively cover the search space. In the experiments by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>, they were running 800 GPUs in parallel for 28 days and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> restricted the search space to contain at most 2 <code>FC</code> layers.</p>

<h3 id="cell-based-representation">Cell-based Representation</h3>

<p>Inspired by the design of using repeated modules in successful vision model architectures (e.g. Inception, ResNet), the <em>NASNet search space</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>) defines the architecture of a conv net as the same cell getting repeated multiple times and each cell contains several operations predicted by the NAS algorithm. A well-designed cell module enables transferability between datasets. It is also easy to scale down or up the model size by adjusting the number of cell repeats.</p>

<p>Precisely, the NASNet search space learns two types of cells for network construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Normal Cell</em>: The input and output feature maps have the same dimension.</li>
  <li><em>Reduction Cell</em>: The output feature map has its width and height reduced by half.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NASNet-search-space.png" alt="NASNet search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. The NASNet search space constrains the architecture as a repeated stack of cells. The cell architecture is optimized via NAS algorithms. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>)</em></p>

<p>The predictions for each cell are grouped into \(B\) blocks (\(B=5\) in the NASNet paper), where each block has 5 prediction steps made by 5 distinct softmax classifiers corresponding to discrete choices of the elements of a block. Note that the NASNet search space does not have residual connections between cells and the model only learns skip connections on their own within blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/cell-prediction-steps.png" alt="5 prediction steps in one block"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4. (a) Each cell consists of \(B\) blocks and each block is predicted by 5 discrete decisions. (b) An concrete example of what operations can be chosen in each decision step.</em></p>

<p><a name="ScheduledDropPath"></a>During the experiments, they discovered that a modified version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648"><em>DropPath</em></a>, named <em>ScheduledDropPath</em>, significantly improves the final performance of NASNet experiments. DropPath stochastically drops out paths (i.e. edges with operations attached in NASNet) with a fixed probability. ScheduledDropPath is DropPath with a linearly increasing probability of path dropping during training time.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al (2019)</a> point out three major advantages of the NASNet search space:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The search space size is reduced drastically;</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motif</a>-based architecture can be more easily transferred to different datasets.</li>
  <li>It demonstrates a strong proof of a useful design pattern of repeatedly stacking modules in architecture engineering. For example, we can build strong models by stacking residual blocks in CNN or stacking multi-headed attention blocks in Transformer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hierarchical-structure">Hierarchical Structure</h3>

<p>To take advantage of already discovered well-designed network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motifs</a>, the NAS search space can be constrained as a hierarchical structure, as in <em>Hierarchical NAS</em> (<strong>HNAS</strong>; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)). It starts with a small set of primitives, including individual operations like convolution operation, pooling, identity, etc. Then small sub-graphs (or “motifs”) that consist of primitive operations are recursively used to form higher-level computation graphs.</p>

<p>A computation motif at level \(\ell=1, \dots, L\) can be represented by \((G^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell)})\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)}\) is a set of operations, \(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)} = \{ o^{(\ell)}_1, o^{(\ell)}_2, \dots \}\)</li>
  <li>\(G^{(\ell)}\) is an adjacency matrix, where the entry \(G_{ij}=k\) indicates that operation \(o^{(\ell)}_k\) is placed between node \(i\) and \(j\). The node indices follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological ordering</a> in DAG, where the index \(1\) is the source and the maximal index is the sink node.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/hierarchical-NAS-search-space.png" alt="Hierarchical search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5. (Top) Three level-1 primitive operations are composed into a level-2 motif. (Bottom) Three level-2 motifs are plugged into a base network structure and assembled into a level-3 motif. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To build a network according to the hierarchical structure, we start from the lowest level \(\ell=1\) and recursively define the \(m\)-th motif operation at level \(\ell\) as</p><p>

\[o^{(\ell)}_m = \text{assemble}\Big( G_m^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell-1)} \Big)\]

</p><p>A hierarchical representation becomes \(\Big( \big\{ \{ G_m^{(\ell)} \}_{m=1}^{M_\ell} \big\}_{\ell=2}^L, \mathcal{O}^{(1)} \Big), \forall \ell=2, \dots, L\), where \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}\) contains a set of primitive operations.</p>

<p>The \(\text{assemble}()\) process is equivalent to sequentially compute the feature map of node \(i\) by aggregating all the feature maps of its predecessor node \(j\) following the topological ordering:</p><p>

\[x_i = \text{merge} \big[ \{ o^{(\ell)}_{G^{(\ell)}_{ij}}(x_j) \}_{j &lt; i} \big], i = 2, \dots, \vert G^{(\ell)} \vert\]

</p><p>where \(\text{merge}[]\) is implemented as depth-wise concatenation in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Same as NASNet, experiments in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al (2017)</a> focused on discovering good cell architecture within a predefined “macro” structure with repeated modules. They showed that the power of simple search methods (e.g. random search or evolutionary algorithms) can be substantially enhanced using well-designed search spaces.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02639">Cai et al (2018b)</a> propose a tree-structure search space using path-level network transformation. Each node in a tree structure defines an <em>allocation</em> scheme for splitting inputs for child nodes and a <em>merge</em> scheme for combining results from child nodes. The path-level network transformation allows replacing a single layer with a multi-branch motif if its corresponding merge scheme is add or concat.</p>

    <p><em>In my daily work, I have the good fortune to work with many very talented
people. Some are professional software developers, like myself. Others are for
example researchers, scientist, project leaders, and so on. Is that you? Do you
also write software, but not as your main activity? Do you have some experience
but maybe no formal training? In <a href="https://unfolded.dev/pages/software-development-easy-to-learn-hard-to-master/">this series of blog
posts</a> I will explain
the best practices that I use, so that you may be able to benefit from them. So
that writing software hopefully takes you less effort and gives you more
pleasure.</em></p><h2 id="the-second-thing-for-new-code">The second thing for new code</h2><p>The very first thing I <em>always</em> do when starting something new, is <code>git init</code>.
Potential new hobby project? <code>git init</code>. Sample code for a blog post? <code>git init</code>. Doing programming exercises on something like Exercism.io? <code>git init</code>.
And then I start using git the way I described in the <a href="https://unfolded.dev/posts/2020-07-21-using-git-more-effectively">first
post</a> of this series. There are
virtually no exceptions to this; it hardly costs me anything and it has helped
me plenty of times.</p><p>The second thing that I do, I do just slightly less often, but still very often:
set up <em>continuous integration</em>. Obviously I won't do that for things that I
never push to a remote. And some things that I push to a remote don't need it
either, for example those Exercism coding exercises. But for anything that I
suspect may have a longer life than a few weeks, including <a href="https://github.com/svdo/either-validation-demo/actions">for that sample code
for a blog post</a>, I'll set it up.</p><h2 id="what-is-continuous-integration">What is continuous integration</h2><p>To get rid of potential confusion, let me explain what I mean with continuous
integration, or <em>CI</em> for short. In its most basic form, it's actually quite
simple: every single time you push something to your git remote (e.g. GitHub,
BitBucket, GitLab, etc), an automated process will start that builds your code
and runs all your tests. (You do have unit tests, right? Maybe a nice topic for
a future post in this series.) That's all, if you do that you can claim you're
doing continuous integration.</p><p>The other day, I was talking to one of my researcher colleagues about coding
practices. When I asked him whether he was using continuous integration, he
thankfully asked for clarification. For me the term has become so commonplace
that I hadn't realize that of course for him it wasn't. He is working on a
software library that his (internal) customers integrate into their product. So
quite logically he thought that was what I meant: continuously automatically
integrating his releases into the customer's product code. While doing that is
of course fantastic, that's going quite a few steps further than just basic CI.
In fact, I would say that that is the combination of <em>continuous delivery</em> (the
<em>CD</em> in <em>CI/CD</em>) on his part, plus <em>continuous integration</em> of his delivery on
his customer's end.</p><p>So if you have a <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/">Travis job</a>, a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#section=getting-started">CircleCI
pipeline</a>, a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/">GitLab
pipeline</a>, a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions">GitHub Actions
workflow</a>, a <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/getting-started-with-bamboo-289277283.html">Bamboo build</a>, anything that automatically
build and tests your code when you push it to your remote, you're doing
continuous integration.</p><p>😌</p><h2 id="the-value-of-continuous-integration">The value of continuous integration</h2><p>Ok, so now that we're hopefully on the same page regarding the term <em>continuous
integration</em>, you may be curious why you should bother. Here's a few reasons
that I have.</p><h3 id="safety-net--quality-baseline">Safety net / quality baseline</h3><p>I'm human. I make mistakes. There, I've said it, now you know. I have learnt
that mistakes that escape the development process and end up at the customer,
are way more expensive than mistakes that are caught earlier. So that's why I
like pair programming, because your pair can catch your mistakes while your
making them. It doesn't get any cheaper than that. That's also why I like unit
tests, because they run many times an hour so they also catch mistakes very
quickly. And that's also why I like continuous integration, because it catches
even more mistakes before they escape the development process. For instance,
when I forget to run my unit tests before pushing my code to the remote: CI will
run and immediately notify me. And my reaction to that notification is: cool,
thanks for catching that!</p><p>🤭</p><h3 id="makes-it-easier-for-others-to-contribute">Makes it easier for others to contribute</h3><p>CI runs for any code that is pushed to the remote, not just by me/my team. So if
it's source code that others can also see and use, having CI will lower the
threshold for them to contribute. Even when you have a new team member it will
help. They don't know the source code as well as you do, so they are a lot more
likely to make mistakes. When I contribute code to somebody else's project, it
feels very comforting to see "all green" as part of the automated tests in the
pull request!</p><p>✅</p><h3 id="executable-documentation-of-build--test--deployment">Executable documentation of build &amp; test (&amp; deployment)</h3><p>Just like unit tests are a form of executable code documentation, CI is a form

challenge. Every single time I have to brace myself and mentally prepare for
doing quite a few tries before getting it right. It's just such a complex black
box! You write a script that will run on a not-quite-known configuration on a
unknown server somewhere, and if it fails you get limited feedback. For example,
if you want to automatically test an iOS app, you'll have to specify which
version of the iOS simulator should be used. But before trying the build, you
may not know which are available and what the simulator device identifiers
are that you can use. So you have to try, look at the output, and try again. And
then something else isn't quite right, and you try again. And again. And once
more. Just have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/svdo/either-validation-demo/search?q=%5Bci%5D&amp;type=Commits">eighteen (18!) commits</a> I did for
sample code for a blog post. And you can't even really clean up those commits
because you <em>have</em> to push them to the remote. I guess if it's important to you,
you can do them on a separate branch and squash-merge the branch when you are
done, but I often don't bother. But bottom line: if it doesn't work immediately
and takes a lot of attempts, it's not you. You're not losing your touch, it's
not because you're getting older. You're fine, it's just complicated.</p><p>🤗</p><p>And when you finally have that working CI build and it passes, go ahead and slap that badge on your readme!</p><p><img src="https://unfolded.dev/img/ci-passing.png" alt="CI passing" width="90"></p><p>Since this is a privacy-friendly static web site, I'm not including the ability

<p>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; To enhance our natural thin-slicing abilities, humans have
therefore also developed various cultural practices that make these
instant assessments more reliable. These techniques take advantage
of the fact that deception is fundamentally a cold-cognition act
and relies on cognitive control centers. This means that if we can
impair the cognitive control abilities of people we're trying to
judge, we’ll do a better job of sussing them out: they will
be less able to confuse our cheater-detection systems.</p>
<p>&gt; In one study that has proven enormously useful to law
enforcement agencies, researchers found that police officers could
significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if
suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting
with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not
the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it
increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are
less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this
way.</p>
<p>&gt; This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law
enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential
business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to
make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to
achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce
subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the
load-adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the
load constant but decrease cognitive control ability-weaken the
mental muscles-by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to
do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves
applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the
skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly
widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad
form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.</p>
<p>&gt; A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce
the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we
discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and
other intoxicants is to "downregulate," or temporarily paralyze,
areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. A
couple shots of tequila is the liquid equivalent of a nice jolt of
TMS. It’s therefore no accident that intoxicants of various
sorts are frequently employed by human beings as social lubricants.
Alcohol, kava, cannabis, magic mushrooms, you name it: any
intoxicant that people can get their hands on quickly comes to play
a central role in social occasions, both formal and informal. In
ancient China, no major treaty was signed without first bringing
everyone together in an extended, alcohol-soaked banquet. In fact,
this is one feature of Chinese culture that has not changed a bit
in over four thousand years. Any modern businessperson hoping to
ink a deal with Chinese partners had better get his or her liver in
shape first.</p>
<p>&gt; On a less formal level, this is no doubt why intoxicants
are a universal feature of all sorts of human social gatherings,
from casual cocktail parties to fraternity mixers. Not only is
getting drunk pleasant, it also typically causes people to get
along more freely and easily (at least to a certain point, after
which the drunken fights break out). Intoxication enhances
cooperation in at least two ways. First of all, it reduces social
faking by inhibiting cognitive control centers. Second, if we all
get drunk together, we create a situation of mutual vulnerability
that makes trust easier to establish. Getting drunk is essentially
an act of mental disarmament. In the same way that shaking right
hands with someone assures them that you’re not holding a
weapon, downing a few tequila shots is like checking your
prefrontal cortex at the door. See? No cognitive control. You can
trust me.</p>

</ul><p>Imagine a custom <em>set-like</em> data structure that doesn’t perform hashing and trades performance for tighter memory footprint. Or imagine a <em>dict-like</em> data structure that automatically stores data in a PostgreSQL or Redis database the moment you initialize it; also it lets you to <em>get-set-delete</em> key-value pairs using the usual <em>retrieval-assignment-deletion</em> syntax associated with built-in dictionaries. Custom data structures can give you the power of choice and writing them will make you understand how the built-in data structures in Python are constructed.</p>

<p>One way to understand how built-in objects like dictionary, list, set etc work is to build custom data structures based on them. Python provides several mixin classes in the <code>collection.abc</code> module to design custom data structures that look and act like built-in structures with additional functionalities baked in.</p>

<h2 id="concept-edifice">
Concept Edifice</h2>

<p>To understand how all these work, you’ll need a fair bit of knowledge about Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Mixin Classes etc. I’ll build the concept edifice layer by layer where you’ll learn about interfaces first and how they can be created and used via the <code>abc.ABC</code> class. Then you’ll learn how abstract base classes differ from interfaces. After that I’ll introduce mixins and explain how all these concepts can be knitted together to architect custom data structures with amazing capabilities. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">
Interfaces</h2>

<p>Python interfaces can help you write classes based on common structures. They ensure that classes that provide similar functionalities will also have similar footprints. Interfaces are not as popular in Python as they are in other statically typed language. The dynamic nature and duck-typing capabilities of Python often make them redundant.</p>

<p>However, in larger applications, interfaces can make you avoid writing code that is poorly encapsulated or build classes that look awfully similar but provide completely unrelated functionalities. Moreover, interfaces implicitly spawn other powerful techniques like mixin classes which can help you achieve DRY nirvana.</p>

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

<p>At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. In Python, an interface is basically a specialized abstract class that defines one or more abstract methods. Abstract classes differs from concrete classes in the sense that they aren’t intended to stand on their own and the methods they define shouldn’t have any implementation.</p>

<p>Usually, you inherit from an interface and implement the methods defined in the abstract class in a concrete subclass. Interfaces provide the skeletons and concrete classes provide the implementation of the methods based on those skeletons. Depending on the ways you can architect interfaces, they can be segmented into two primary categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informal Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informal-interfaces">
Informal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Informal interfaces are classes which define methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.</p>

<p>Let’s write an informal interface for a simple calculator class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Informal Interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>ICalc</code> class has four different methods that don’t give you any implementation. It’s an informal interface because you can still instantiate the class but the methods will raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> if you try to apply them. You’ve to subclass the interface to use it. Let’s do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Calc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Calculator"""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>))</span>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why you even need all of these boilerplate code and inheritance when you can directly define the concrete <code>Calc</code> class and call it a day.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario where you want to add additional functionalities to each of the method of the <code>Calc</code> class. Here, you’ve two options. Either you can mutate the original class and add those extra functionalities to the methods or you can create another class with similar footprint and implement all the methods with the added functionalities.</p>

<p>The first option isn’t always viable and can cause regression in real life scenario. The second approach ensures modularity and is generally quicker to implement since you won’t have to worry about messing up the original concrete class. However, figuring out which methods you’ll need to implement in the extended class can be hard because the concrete class might have additional methods that you don’t want in the extended class.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of figuring out the methods from the concrete <code>Calc</code> class, it’s easier to do so from an established structure defined in the <code>ICalc</code> interface. Interfaces make the process of extending class functionalities more tractable. Let’s make another class that will add logging to all of the methods of the <code>Calc</code> class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>logging</span>

<span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>basicConfig</span><span>(</span><span>level</span><span>=</span><span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>INFO</span><span>)</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>

<p>In the above class, I’ve defined another class called <code>CalcLog</code> that basically extends the functionalities of the previously defined <code>Calc</code> class. Here, I’ve inherited from the informal interface <code>ICalc</code> and implemented all the methods with additional info logging capability.</p>

<p>Although writing informal interfaces is trivial, there are multiple issues that plagues them. The user of the interface class can still instantiate it like a normal class and won’t be able to tell the difference between a it and a concrete class until she tries to use any of the methods define inside the interface. Only then the methods will throw exceptions. This can have unintended side effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, informal interfaces won’t compel you to implement all the methods in the subclasses. You can easily get away without implementing a particular method defined in the interface. It won’t complain about the unimplemented methods in the subclasses. However, if you try to use a method that hasn’t been implemented in the subclass, you’ll get an error. This means even if <code>issubclass(ConcreteSubClass, Interface)</code> shows <code>True</code>, you can’t rely on it since it doesn’t give you the guarantee that the <code>ConcreteSubClass</code> has implemented all the methods defined in the <code>Interface</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s create another class <code>FakeCalc</code> an only implement one method defined in the <code>ICalc</code> abstract class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Fake calculator that doesn't implement all the methods
    defined in the interface."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>


<span># Using the class
</span><span>cfake</span> <span>=</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>()</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-48-035c519cee55&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
        10 cfake = FakeCalc()
        11 print(cfake.add(1,2))
---&gt; 12 print(cfake.sub(2,3))


&lt;ipython-input-45-255c6a2093b0&gt; in sub(self, a, b)
        6
        7     def sub(self, a, b):
----&gt; 8         raise NotImplementedError
        9
        10     def mul(self, a, b):


NotImplementedError:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Despite not implementing all the methods defined in the <code>ICalc</code> class, I was still able to instantiate the <code>FakeCalc</code> concrete class. However, when I tried to apply a method <code>sub</code> that wasn’t implemented in the concrete class, it gave me an error. Also, <code>issubclass(FakeCalc, ICalc)</code> returns <code>True</code> which can mislead you into thinking that all the methods of the subclass <code>FakeCalc</code> are usable. It can cause subtle bugs can be difficult to detect. Formal interfaces try to overcome these issues.</p>

<h2 id="formal-interfaces">
Formal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Formal interfaces do not suffer from the problems that plague informal interfaces. So if you want to implement an interface that the users can’t initiate independently and that forces them to implement all the methods in the concrete sub classes, formal interface is the way to go. In Python, the idiomatic way to define formal interfaces is via the <code>abc</code> module. Let’s transform the previously mentioned <code>ICalc</code> interface into a formal one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Formal interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>

    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
      …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
