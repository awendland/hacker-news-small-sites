<p>14th August 2019</p>
<p>The Visible Lisp Computer is a Lisp interpreter that displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display, so you can see program execution and garbage collection in real time:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Visible Lisp Computer displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display as it runs.</em></p>
<p>It's a special version of my uLisp interpreter for ARM boards <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, designed to run on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board, interfaced to an I2C OLED display.</p>
<p>For example, when you evaluate a recursive function, such as the Fibonacci function, you can see the memory being allocated to perform the calculation, and garbage collections clearing unused memory. Apart from being fun, it's educational, giving an insight into how a language with garbage collection works.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Visible Lisp Computer runs on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, which is an ideal ATSAMD21 board for running uLisp. It's available from Adafruit&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>, or Pimoroni in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Lisp workspace is displayed on a 64x48 OLED display. This is an ideal fit, as uLisp running on an ATSAMD21 gives you a workspace of 3072 free Lisp objects (each of 8 bytes), and the 64x48 display provides 3072 pixels. I chose a low-cost monochrome I2C display, available from AliExpress&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>. The program would also work on larger SSD1306-based OLED displays, such as the widely available 128x64 ones.</p>
<p>Free Lisp objects are displayed in black, and when an object is in use it is displayed in white. Periodically you see the garbage collection reclaiming used objects that can no longer be accessed.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's how to connect up the display to the Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer2.gif" alt="VisibleLispComputer2.gif" width="457" height="245"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Visible Lisp Computer based on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0.</em></p>
<p>You need pullup resistors of about 4.7kΩ from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<p>Instead of using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 you can build an equivalent Visible Lisp Computer using an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board by following my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputerproto.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputerProto.jpg" width="710" height="375"></p>
<p><em>Version of the Visible Lisp Computer built on a prototyping board.</em></p>
<p>The I2C OLED display connects to GND, VCC, SDA (pin 21), and SCL (pin 22). Again, you need 4.7kΩ pullup resistors from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here's an example of the Visible Lisp Computer in action.</p>
<p>First we enter a sample Lisp function to evaluate; I'll use the Fibonacci function, as it should be familiar to most programmers:</p>
<pre>(defun fib (n)
  (if (&lt; n 3) 1
    (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))</pre>
<p>Initially the display is black. After entering this in the Serial Monitor the display shows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer1.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer1.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>The function is stored in the Lisp workspace as a series of Lisp objects, indicated by the row of white pixels starting in the top left corner.</p>
<p>Evaluating the function by entering, for example:</p>
<pre>(fib 10)</pre>
<p>allocates Lisp objects as the function is executed, indicated by a white block extending down from the top of the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer2.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer2.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>This call to the Fibonacci function executed within the workspace available, without triggering a garbage collection.</p>
<p>If we now evaluate:</p>
<pre>(fib 16)</pre>
<p>the function triggers several garbage collections as it executes to reclaim unused objects, while leaving the intermediate values, which are still in use, visible on the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<h3>Turning off the workspace display</h3>
<p>The workspace display is on by default. Because updating the display causes Lisp programs to run more slowly, I've added a Lisp command&nbsp;to turn the display off; give the command:</p>
<pre>(display nil)</pre>
<p>To turn it back on again give the command:</p>
<pre>(display t)</pre>
<p>The standard version of uLisp does a garbage collection after you input each command at the Serial Monitor or REPL. When running the workspace display this is disabled, to avoid the lag caused by the garbage collection after every line of input. If you want to tidy up the screen display before running a program you can do a manual garbage collection by giving the command:</p>
<pre>(gc)</pre>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The workspace display interfaces with uLisp in three places. In each case a flag, <strong>DISPLAYFLAG</strong>, determines whether the workspace display is active.</p>
<h4>Lisp objects</h4>
<p>All objects in ARM uLisp consist of two 4-byte cells, so every object occupies 8 bytes. There are several different types of object, such as symbol, number, or cons, identified by the constant in the left-hand cell:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects1.gif" alt="Objects1.gif" width="422" height="80"></p>
<ul>
<li>A symbol contains '2' in the left cell, and the name of the symbol packed in the right cell, or a pointer to the symbol in a symbol table.</li>
<li>A number contains '4' in the left cell, and the 32-bit signed integer value in the right cell.</li>
<li>Finally, a cons contains an address pointer in each cell pointing to other objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Address pointers are always larger than the largest constant used to identify other types of object.</p>
<h4>Initialising the workspace</h4>
<p>When the workspace is first initialised, by calling <strong>initworkspace()</strong>, all the objects are added to a list of free objects:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects2.gif" alt="Objects2.gif" width="720" height="78"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels on the workspace display are plotted in black with a call to <strong>PlotObject()</strong>:</p>
<pre>void initworkspace () {
  Freelist = NULL;
  for (int i=WORKSPACESIZE-1; i&gt;=0; i--) {
    object *obj = &amp;Workspace[i];
    if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(i, 0);
    car(obj) = NULL;
    cdr(obj) = Freelist;
    Freelist = obj;
    Freespace++;
  }
}</pre>
<h4>Allocating an object</h4>
<p>A Lisp object in the workspace is allocated by a call to <strong>myalloc()</strong>. It's taken off the freelist and returned by the call. For example, creating the list:</p>
<pre>(fib 6)</pre>
<p>will take four objects from the freelist:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects4.gif" alt="Objects4.gif" width="720" height="130"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels in the workspace display are plotted in white:</p>
<pre>object *myalloc () {
  if (Freespace == 0) error2(0, PSTR("no room"));
  object *temp = Freelist;
  Freelist = cdr(Freelist);
  Freespace--;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)temp - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 1);
  return temp;
}</pre>
<p>The address of the object is calculated by subtracting the address of the start of the workspace from the address of the new object, and dividing by eight because each Lisp object is 8 bytes.</p>
<h4>Freeing an object</h4>
<p>Finally, a Lisp object is freed by a call to <strong>myfree()</strong>. It is put on the front of the freelist, and the corresponding pixel in the workspace display is plotted in black:</p>
<pre>inline void myfree (object *obj) {
  car(obj) = NULL;
  cdr(obj) = Freelist;
  Freelist = obj;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)obj - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 0);
  Freespace++;
}</pre>
<p>Objects are freed automatically during garbage collection; the programmer doesn't have to worry about freeing objects.</p>
<h4>Graphics display routines</h4>
<p>This display maps each byte in the display memory to a vertical column of eight pixels. Unfortunately the SSD1306 display driver chip doesn't support reading back of the contents of the display memory, so to provide the ability to change a single pixel, without affecting the others in the same column, a copy of the display memory is maintained in RAM; fortunately it's only 384 bytes (64x48/8).</p>
<p>The routines used to implement the workspace display are <strong>InitDisplay()</strong>, to initialise the OLED display, <strong>ClearDisplay()</strong> to clear the display, and <strong>PlotObject()</strong>, which plots a pixel corresponding to a Lisp object in the workspace.</p>
<h3>Uploading the program</h3>
<p>Whether you're using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a breadboard as described in my article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>, upload the Visible Lisp Computer as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven't already got it, install the <strong>Adafruit SAMD Boards</strong> in the <strong>Boards Manager</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong> board.</li>
<li>Upload the Visible Lisp Computer file to the board.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should then be able to run uLisp, and enter commands at the Serial Monitor as described in <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?19XT">Using uLisp</a>.</p>
<p>This is based on the current version of uLisp, Version 2.8a, but for simplicity it only supports the&nbsp;<strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong>&nbsp;Boards Manager option.</p>
<p>Here's the whole Visible Lisp Computer program:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/list?2OLU">Visible Lisp Computer program</a>.</p>
<p>Or get it from GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/visible-lisp-computer" target="_blank">Visible Lisp Computer</a>.</p>
<h3>Further suggestions</h3>
<p>The current project simply distinguishes between an allocated Lisp object (white) and a free object (black). Using a colour display you could use different colours to identify the different types of object: nil, symbol, integer, stream, character, float, string, or cons.</p><hr>

        <p><figcaption>S. Yuvarajaa</figcaption></p></figure><div><p><em>Editor’s note: IRCTC’s response on Twitter has been added to the story.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Kozhikode, KERALA — On the afternoon of October 23, S. Yuvarajaa was at his home in Tirupur, writing software, when the Railway Police Force came knocking on his door.&nbsp;</p><p>“Did you develop this app?” the policemen asked, pointing to a phone screen displaying Super Tatkal, a phone app developed by Yuvarajaa that books tatkal rail tickets much faster than Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/irctc/">IRCTC</a>), the Indian Railways’ famously cumbersome website.</p><p>When he said ‘yes’, Yuvarajaa, a 32-year-old alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur, was arrested under the Indian Railways Act 1989 for the “unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets”.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/lsr-student-suicide-lockdown-poverty-hostel-policy_in_5fa8ab81c5b6f21920dd705e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockdown Poverty And Hostel Policy Push LSR Scholarship Student To Suicide</a></strong></em></p><p>Soon after his arrest, the railway authorities deactivated Super Tatkal and Super Tatkal Pro, which were available on Google Playstore until then. Yuvarajaa spent about a week in jail.</p><p>Now out on bail and faced with mounting legal fees, Yuvarajaa says he just wants the railways to understand that far from “swindling” users — as the railways have alleged — he just wanted to help rail passengers book their tickets with ease.</p><p>“I want them to talk to me and find out how the apps can help IRCTC’s ticket-booking operations. I might have been naïve and unaware of consequences when I developed the apps but I had the best of intentions,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “I have a solution that can effectively address the current issues on the IRCTC website<strong>.</strong> I would like to help them make their website better so that end users, the passengers, can book tickets easily.”</p><p>For now, Yuvarajaa and Super Tatkal have become unfortunate case studies of what happens when the software industry’s ethos of digital disruption crashes into India’s famously prickly bureaucracy as epitomised by the 167-year-old Indian Railways.&nbsp;</p><p>A young coder from a small town who gave up a comfortable job in an aeronautics firm to set up his own business, Yuvarajaa is a poster child for the Indian government’s mission to support digital entrepreneurs of the sort that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> exhorts to “take risks” and embark on adventures.</p><p>Yet, as Yuvarajaa’s arrest shows, the biggest impediment to innovation are his government’s many departments. Yuvarajaa saw himself as an entrepreneur’ but the Railways press release announcing his arrest described him as a “tout”.</p><p>&nbsp;“Regulatory frameworks, be that of IRCTC or that of any other government institution, should not be bypassed,” said S. Arunachalam, Academic Director of Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Indian School of Business. “But I think that he should have been warned first to reach an amicable solution.”&nbsp;</p><p>IRCTC responded to <em>HuffPost India</em> on Twitter, saying that the use of “illegal software” is prohibited under the Railways Act.</p></div><div><blockquote data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The software developed was used illegally to book tkts through the tickets denying genuine users.Use of illegal software is prohibited under Rly act. No faster app as these features were  available with IRCTC which were disabled to ensure level playing field .</p>— IRCTC (@IRCTCofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/IRCTCofficial/status/1328668272032583683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote></div><div><h3><strong>From Tirupur to Super Tatkal</strong></h3><p>The story of Super Tatkal has its roots in Yuvarajaa’s journey from a small town in Tamil Nadu to Bengaluru, India’s self-described Silicon Valley.</p><p>Yuvarajaa comes from a family of farmers—&nbsp;his father worked as one until he died in 2008 and his mother, Eswari, still cultivates the family’s 30 acres of land.</p><p>Yuvarajaa recalls that he first started programming in BASIC as an 11-year-old. Soon, he developed a love for coding and started considering engineering as a career option when he was introduced to Java in Class XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, Yuvarajaa signed up for an aeronautical engineering degree at the Madras Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu’s premier tech school. Since he had topped Class XII in his district, he had a three-year scholarship of Rs 3,000 per month from the Indian government’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p><p>At MIT-Chennai, Yuvarajaa met others like him who loved coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were a group of people who liked programming. When some of us went on to take up jobs, Yuvarajaa went for higher studies as he was passionate about engineering,” said Akilan, a friend and fellow aeronautical engineer who is currently working in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating in 2010 from MIT Chennai, Yuvarajaa joined IIT-Kharagpur for an M. Tech in aeronautical engineering. Again, he had a scholarship, this time for topping the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering).&nbsp;</p><p>Once he finished his IIT course, he joined a firm in Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p><p>“In aeronautical engineering there are very few private firms which offer jobs. But he got one of the good jobs available in India,” Akilan said.&nbsp;</p><p>While working in Bengaluru, Yuvarajaa frequently booked tickets to travel home to Tirupur.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was then that I realised that the IRCTC app is terribly slow. Besides, I always wanted to develop apps and this felt like the right time,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “So Super Tatkal took shape.”</p><p>Super Tatkal, launched in 2016, allowed users to prefill their journey details and paste these onto the IRCTC website. This sped up the booking process by about five times the usual time it takes to book tickets on IRCTC website, said Yuvarajaa.&nbsp;</p><p>The app was buggy at first, he said, but a steady group of users kept sharing their experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went about correcting the bugs and realised that the app was gaining traction,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Super Tatkal was free for the first year. Later, as the maintenance cost of servers increased to Rs 10,000 per month, Yuvarajaa asked for user contributions — but this didn’t help much. He then decided to finance the app through in-app purchases where users were asked to buy a stack of 10 virtual coins for Rs 20. After the first three free bookings, the app charged five coins per transaction —&nbsp;ie, a nominal fee of Rs 10 per booking.</p><p>The Railway Police claims Yuvarajaa earned Rs 20 lakh through Super Tatkal between 2016 and 2020. This may sound like a big number, but it works out to about Rs 40,000 per month.</p><p>Yuvarajaa said all his users were aware of the payment model and that he had not cheated anyone into paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><figure>
        <p><figcaption>A screengrab of the Super Tatkal Pro app before it was deactivated.</figcaption></p></figure><div><h3><strong>‘Didn’t take permission’</strong></h3><p>While Super Tatkal was taking off, Yuvarajaa soon became comfortable in the startup bubble. He quit his job in 2017 and started a truck aggregator app, Speedbird trucks, along with two of his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was like an Ola or Uber for trucks. It took off well in the beginning,” Yuvarajaa said. But before the app could get traction, trouble started. It was difficult to convince people to use the trucks available on the app because existing contracts from known services seemed simpler for users.&nbsp;</p><p>“We took on lease two trucks to run the app but that ended in losses,” said Yuvarajaa. The company was built on the life savings of the three young men and it lacked a business model.&nbsp;</p><p>“To arrive at the business model one has to experiment with various models and this costs money,” said Yuvarajaa. The company also lacked a mentor, an industry insider, who could have offered steady advice and feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is difficult to network and find help when you are a beginner,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also didn’t have an investor. “We were at the experimental stage and could not win the confidence of an investor,” he said. In the experimental stage, startups built on little resources are mostly on their own and can only dream of reaching the patent filing stage which gets support from the Union government.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Super Tatkal was doing relatively well. “The users kept growing and I launched a second app—Super Tatkal Pro—which allowed booking on IRCTC’s rail connect app in 2019,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>To keep his startup alive and to support his family, Yuvarajaa also worked as a freelance programmer. The income was small but steady. However, unbeknownst to Yuvarajaa, his app was on the Railway police’s radar.&nbsp;</p><p>“RPF Cyber Cell at Southern Railway Headquarters Chennai had played a key role in analysis of data and identification of the fake app developer’s location and also collected digital evidences i.e server source code, application source code, end-users list and bank statements of the offender,” the Railway police said in their press release.</p><p>Yuvarajaa’s mistake, an officer at the security command centre of RPF told <em>HuffPost India</em>, was that “he did not obtain the needed permission from IRCTC and was working like a ticketing agent”.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Railways Act, all those who help passengers with ticketing are expected to register with the IRCTC as an agent. Does this apply for app creators? The officer reserved his comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuvarajaa, however, said that he was “trying to create something of value for people” and that he “was not aware that the app would be considered illegal”. IRCTC could have sent him a warning or a cease-and-desist order before swooping in, he rued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arunachalam, of the Indian School of Business, said Yuvarajaa’s case points to the need for more mentorship in India’s start-up space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“He does not seem to have understood the process well,” Arunachalam said.</p><p>Back in Tirupur, Yuvarajaa said that he hopes to work with the Railways once his legal troubles end.</p><p>Will he revive his apps if he gets the required permission from IRCTC?&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like to,” he said.</p><p><em>This story was corrected to say that Yuvarajaa was arrested on October 23 and spent about a week in jail, not a month-and-a-half.</em></p></div>

You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue. If it's not, have you thought about who is filling this role on your team?</p><p>Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful. Managed deliberately, glue work demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills. Left unconscious, it can be career limiting. It can push people into less technical roles and even out of the industry.</p><p>Let's talk about how to allocate glue work deliberately, frame it usefully and make sure that everyone is choosing a career path they actually want to be on.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1556739775888_8389"><p>(💖💖💖Thank so much to the organisers of the amazing <a href="https://theleaddeveloper.com/" target="_blank">Lead Developer conference</a> where I presented this version of these slides.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>When Mattermost first started, it didn’t make sense for us to have an office; it was just myself and one other person. They were writing code the whole time, and I was on the phone the whole time, and being in the office we ended up interrupting each other. So eventually we started working from our homes and only got together when we needed to catch up.</p><p>As the company grew, we were hiring lots of artists and freelancers based everywhere from Los Angeles to Toronto. Even though there were more of us, it didn’t make sense for us to have an office space when most of the team was somewhere else anyway. We could simply hop on Skype, have our conversation, and get back to work. We became addicted to our ability to source really great talent from anywhere in the world, and addicted to the productivity of not having to worry about the overhead of an office, the time wasted commuting every day, or the frustration of having to find a space to meet up.</p><figure id="attachment_11249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11249"><a href="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" data-size="{&quot;w&quot;:1920,&quot;h&quot;:1280}"><img loading="lazy" src="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" alt="The Mattermost team" width="2560" height="640" srcset="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-300x75.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-768x192.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1536x384.jpg 1536w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-2048x512.jpg 2048w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-716x179.jpg 716w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-820x205.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11249">The Mattermost team</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t to say scaling a remote team has been easy. We’ve learned a lot about what makes for a great remote experience. Here are a few of the lessons learned about the challenges of remote work, and how we make it work for our team.</p><h2><strong>Pair design helps remote collaboration run smoothly</strong></h2><p>One of the superpowers of a remote team is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">embracing the ability to work asynchronously</a>. Unfortunately, this can also make large group collaboration more challenging. There are certain problems you might want a relatively large group to work together — for example, planning our annual onsite. In an office setting, you’d just get those four or five or seven people together camped out in a conference room for a whole week, knocking out the problem. But it can be particularly challenging to wrangle a large group of people to carve out a long chunk of time to work together remotely. Everyone has other priorities they’re trying to juggle.</p><p>We’ve found what works best for remote collaboration is keeping the collaboration smaller. We try to apply <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/benefits-of-design-pairing-2a3ceb0bdfac?gi=df46f7c04818">pair design</a> practices wherever we can; if you can break down and prioritize bigger problems into smaller problems two people can tackle, they can work through the problem, talk through it, and agree on it. Then, when they come back to a broader group, they come in with a much more polished solution and it’s easier to get an idea implemented.</p><h2><strong>Documentation is the secret to great onboarding and culture building</strong></h2><p>There’s a bit of a misconception that companies can only build stronger cultures in-person versus remote. I would say culture is stronger when everything is written down because everyone who joins the company has the same baseline: a consistent onboarding experience and documentation as the shared source of truth.</p><p>Remote onboarding done right can be far more scalable, efficient, and impactful. We get a good deal of positive feedback for our onboarding process at Mattermost because <a href="https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding">everything is documented</a>. In-office onboarding experiences are usually a series of person-to-person interactions that mete out information bit by bit — you might talk to 18 different people throughout the day, each with a different piece of the organizational puzzle. When you’re a remote company, onboarding is a lot more focused on reading through information.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong — new hires at Mattermost still talk to a lot of people in their first few weeks —&nbsp;but the interactions they have are more meaningful because they’ve gotten all the administrative stuff out of the way. New hires can get up to speed on the history and context of ongoing projects and initiatives when they join and can start asking much higher quality, deep questions during those first interactions.</p><h2><strong>To find great remote employees, prioritize candidates with strong writing skills</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s become even more clear during the pandemic: there are people who really like working remote and thrive in a remote work environment, but it’s not for everyone. Right now everyone needs to work remotely. While many people have realized working from home is amazing — they love not having to commute, they love the independence, the flexibility — there are others who really miss the office environment.</p><p>One of the biggest indicators that we’ve found around who thrives in a remote environment is strong written communication skills. If you’re a strong writer and you can consume information in written formats really well, you’ll probably have an easier time transitioning to a remote team than someone who prefers face-to-face communication.</p><h2><strong>Want to join Mattermost’s remote-first team?</strong></h2><p>Mattermost is on a mission to connect the world with what matters most, and we’re continually looking for people to help us achieve that goal —&nbsp;no matter where in the world they live.&nbsp;To learn more about what it’s like to work at Mattermost and to see our current open roles, check out our <a href="https://mattermost.com/careers/">Careers page</a>.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>When <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#tim">Tim</a>, <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron">Aaron</a>, and <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian">I</a>
started working on this problem in August 2018 we immediately began playing with <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>.
It was an open source project that gave us a lot of the things Aaron and I had been talking about in order to deliver the
features we felt were critical to our success.  Noms gave us the ability to efficiently diff across commits, and
merge commits.  Though Noms had become an inactive project, we felt it would tremendously improve our go to market
time to use it as our storage layer, so we decided it was worth diving deeper.</p>
<p>I built a demo of a command line tool that used the Git commands people already know in order to
version structured table data.  As we played with the demo, we felt like we were on to something, and
decided to really go after the "Git for Data" product that is <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> today. After additional
investment in delivering a fully featured Git-like command line we began to think about <a href="https://dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a>,
a place for our users to find, collaborate on, and store data projects. This was the first time we needed to access
data stored using Noms on backend servers, and it was at this time we discovered issues with how Noms handled errors.</p>

<p>I'm not going to go into detail on the language design decisions behind Go's panics and errors.  If you would like that
background before going further I'd take a look at <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/on-the-uses-and-misuses-of-panics-in-go/">this article</a>
which covers it in depth.  However, a nasty problem with panics is that a panic without a deferred recover on any go routine
will crash your program.  If you are writing a server handling many concurrent requests, any panic that escapes on any
go routine will cause every single one of the concurrently executing requests to fail.  All those connections will be
closed, and the server will restart. In a sufficiently complicated server where go routines handling requests
spawn additional go routines and use <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/communicating-sequential-processes-csp-for-go-developer-in-a-nutshell-866795eb879d">CSP</a>
to do work, using panics for flow control is a recipe for disaster. With so much invested in using Noms, we decided to
"hard fork" the project and eliminate the heavy use of panics.</p>

<p>The process of eliminating panics started out pretty straight forward.  Search the codebase for a panic, change the
signature of the method to return an error, and replace the panic.  Then find all the call sites where the method
and handle the error, or return it up the callstack.  I thought I'd be able to migrate from panics to errors
in about a week.  Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>As soon as I realized that Noms could panic when calculating the hash of its types I knew I was way off. In the
end I think I spent closer to 6 weeks on this.  It was time-consuming, and boring, but it couldn't be automated and every
one of the changes was an opportunity to introduce bugs.  Today, searching the updated Noms codebase for <code>if err != nil</code>
returns 1370 results, and I'm guessing more than half of those were introduced while removing panics. It effected hundreds
of function signatures.  Because Noms lies below our main application's code, the changes bubble up to all the code which
depends on Noms directly and indirectly. </p>

<p>GO advocates for using CSP in order to write concurrent code.  New go routines are spawned in order to do parallel processing
and channels are used to communicate between go routines.  It was in these cases where panics were causing the biggest problems,
and they were the more interesting cases to talk about when converting panics to errors, as converting these improperly
can introduce deadlocks.</p>
<p>Lets start by defining a simple function we want to run concurrently:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> workItem <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> workCh <span>{</span>
        res<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span>workItem<span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> err
        <span>}</span>       

        resCh <span>&lt;-</span> res
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function takes a channel that it reads work items from, and a channel that it writes results to.  In the event that
an error is encountered the function returns the error. A straightforward, but erroneous way to handle this would be:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>myConcurrentFunc</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workItems WorkItem<span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>WorkItemResult<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>return</span> workItemResults<span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first problem here, is that the <code>err</code> instance is modified and read in an unsafe manner.  This can be resolved using
a mutex or Go's atomic primitives, and this is a simplified version of how I handled these errors in many cases. I created
a class <code>AtomicError</code> that made these types of operations thread safe, but this example still has other issues. </p>
<p>If <code>process()</code> errors on one of the go routines, all the other ones will continue running until they all error, or
all the work items have been completed despite not having any impact (No matter what happens we are going to <code>return nil, err</code>).
Depending on the use, maybe this behavior is acceptable, but in cases where the operation takes a long time, this does not
work.  This can be fixed by testing the state of the atomic error in the <code>process</code> loop but it can make the code pretty ugly. </p>
<p>Another suboptimal characteristic of this code is that you need to create the channels with buffers
large enough to hold every work item, and result.  It is possible to avoid this also, but it involves additional synchronization
in order to close the result channel just a single time when an error is encountered, or when all work is done and the last
go processing routine exits.  </p>
<p>Finally, when we are talking about this being run on a server as a part of a request, there is the very real possibility
that the request may get cancelled for some reason, such as exceeding some pre-defined deadline.  In order to handle this
and the other errors in a cleaner way I wish I had known about <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup">errgroup</a>.</p>

<p>errgroup is an extremely simple package with just <a href="https://github.com/golang/sync/blob/master/errgroup/errgroup.go">a single small file</a>.
It uses the <code>context.Context</code> that is used throughout Golang to implement <code>errgroup.Group</code> which will update the context
if any one of them returns an error. Our updated code looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This code handles all the issues enumerated above, and it also allows the results to be handled concurrently with the
processing.  In the cases where you are doing something expensive with each result this could provide a performance
improvement.</p>

<p>There seems to be only one reason to use panics for flow control. Littering your code with explicit error checking after
every function call is tedious and ugly.  You are right, but the beauty of your code, won't improve your product. Go
forces explicit error handling that results in programs that do the appropriate things when error conditions are encountered.
It may be ugly, but I hope my pain and suffering serve as yet another reason not to use panics instead of returning errors.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>Published on 2019-09-01 by <a href="https://alexbakker.me/">Alexander Bakker</a></span></p><article><p>I think I experienced a random bit flip while updating Linux on one of my
machines today. My laptop was humming along happily during compilation until GCC
suddenly aborted with an error: <strong><em>invalid preprocessing directive #lefine; did
you mean #define?</em></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexbakker.me/img/random-bit-flip.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Huh, <code>#lefine</code> instead of <code>#define</code>?</p>

<p>Now, GCC is known for its cryptic error messages, but this one left me baffled.
Things I tried to figure out what the issue could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>I first grepped the offending file, <code>drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h</code>, for
<code>#lefine</code> to see if a typo somehow slipped through the Linux 4.19.1 release,
but got 0 matches.</li>
<li>When I resumed the build, it completed without errors. The kernel also
appeared to run fine upon reboot. I ended up recompiling it entirely multiple
times to see if I could reproduce the error, but I couldn’t.</li>
<li>I ran a MemTest86 test for 24 hours, but it didn’t find any errors, so the RAM
is also unlikely to be the culprit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I was losing my mind until it dawned on me that this could have been
caused by cosmic rays. Looking at ASCII table, we see that ’d’ and ‘l’ are
indeed one bit flip away from each other:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>char</th>
<th>decimal</th>
<th>binary</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>1100100</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>l</td>
<td>108</td>
<td>1101100</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Could that be it? Isn’t that incredibly unlikely? There doesn’t appear to be a
consensus in existing literature <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> on how often these errors
actually occur, but I did learn that this phenomenon is actually more common
than I thought. The chances of flipping a bit that would cause software to break
in this fashion, on the other hand, must be incredibly small.</p>

<p>In the end, there’s just no way to prove that this was actually caused by cosmic
rays. It could also have been some other extremely rare hardware fluke. Either
way, this took me by surprise, to say the least.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the cosmos’ way of telling me to invest in ECC RAM.</p>

<p>In the spirit of “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html" target="_blank">A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux</a>,”  we are going to try to create a minimal 64 bit ELF executable using just standard D and some inline assembly code.</p>



<p>We are going to focus on creating the standard hello world executable popularized by Brian Kernighan. </p>



<p>In the standard D language, using the phobos library (the now only real standard library for D, previously there existed two competing standard libraries), we would write this as:</p>


<pre title="">import std.stdio;

int main(){
    write("Hello\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this:</p>



<pre><code>dmd basic_hello.d </code></pre>



<p>yields a 1.9M executable.</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./basic_hello
 1895528 ./basic_hello</code></pre>



<p>Using gdc brings it down to 28k. Note: gdc like gcc defaults to naming the executable ‘a.out’, whereas dmd names it after the file or module.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 28608 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So we get some improvement.  The biggest issue is that it is dynamically linking in a bunch of code we don’t need, including a bunch of machinery for exceptions we won’t throw, and code to handle cases we don’t need.  Really we just need to put a string to standard out, which is exactly what the C function puts is for.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;

int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this with gdc give us a small decrease in size.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 21296 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Running ldd on it we can see we still pull in the D runtime even though we don’t need it.</p>



<p>&gt; ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd02db8000)<br>libgphobos.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgphobos.so.1 (0x00007f4b1caa8000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f4b1ca8d000)<br>libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c947000)<br>libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f4b1c925000)<br>libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f4b1c91e000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c753000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4b1d09f000)</p>



<p>This is exactly what betterC mode is for! Let’s try it. We just need to modify our main function to be ‘extern(C)’.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;
extern(C):
int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>With gdc, betterC mode is called with the flag ‘no-druntime’.</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 20600 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So that is pretty good and we are down to just 20k. And we are only linking against the standard C library.</p>



<p>&gt;ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd119c7000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f447f734000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f447f569000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f447f783000)</p>



<p>We can run strip on it to save some space:</p>



<pre><code>strip -s ./a.out
wc -c ./a.out
 15016 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Now we are running into the limits of what we can do with linking to the C standard library without switching to musl.  And even there we are getting away from programming in D and instead just messing with optimizing C code, which is not the point of this article.</p>



<p>So how does the C standard library print a string to standard output?  In the end it performs a system call.  In modern Windows Microsoft makes it unreasonably hard to do this by changing the syscall numbers on every update.  This might stop some viruses that hardcode system calls, but makes it impossible to do any Windows programming without using the C standard library/Win32 API. So in this article we will focus on Linux in particular since the system call interface is explicitly blessed by the kernel developers.  FreeBSD and other Unices tend to prefer the usage of the C standard library API.  Here we will also just worry about the x86_64 architecture(being 2020, the only other architecture in major use that is widely supported by D compilers is AARCH64).</p>



<p>The system call interface for Linux is specified in the System V ABI document <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. In short, you just pass the syscall number in the RAX register, and the other arguments in rdi, rsi, rdx, etc.</p>



<p>The 3 main D language compilers, DMD, GDC, and LDC, all have slightly different ways you can include assembly code inline.  Just for fun I wrote a version for each using their features.  One thing I noticed is when using the LDC version of inline assembly it mentions needing a comma separated list for the constraints. I included some spaces in the list and received an invalid asm constraint error that was ridiculously tricky to track down.</p>



<p>One other thing to note is that the main function we have been using so far is based on the fact that in the end we link to the standard C library which also has a main function that is called from another entry point, by not using the standard C library and the start files from it (which basically help the C language runtime set up some scaffolding it needs for ‘atexit’ and such (side side note, the C language does have a runtime, you just usually don’t notice it)) we no longer have an entry point.  Most things assume the entry point is called ‘_start’, but this can be overridden in the linker. </p>



<p>Let’s write our syscall routines in a file called syscall.d:</p>


<pre title="">module syscall;
version (LDC)
{
    import ldc.llvmasm;
}

version (Posix)
{
extern (C):
pragma(inline, true):
    long syscall1(long number, long a1) @system @nogc nothrow

                mov ret, RAX;
            }
            return ret;
        }
        version (GNU)
        {

        {
            pragma(LDC_allow_inline);
            return __asm!long("syscall", "={rax},{rax},{rdi}
        ~{rcx},~{r11}", number, a1);
        }
    }
extern (C):

                mov RDI, a1[RBP];
                mov RSI, a2[RBP];
                mov RDX, a3[RBP];
                syscall;
                mov ret, RAX;
            }
            return ret;
        }
        version (GNU)
        {
            long ret;
            asm @system @nogc nothrow
            {
                "syscall" : "=a"(ret) : "a"(number), "D"(a1), "S"(a2), "d"(a3) : "rcx", "r11";
            }
            return ret;
        }
        version (LDC)
        {
            pragma(LDC_allow_inline);
            return __asm!long("syscall",
                    "={rax},{rax},{rdi},{rsi},{rdx},~{rcx},~{r11}", number, a1, a2, a3);
        }
    }



}

</pre>


<pre><code>And our _start entry point and some helper functions in hello.d:</code></pre>


<pre title="">import syscall;

immutable long SYS_WRITE = 1;
immutable long SYS_EXIT = 60;

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
pragma(inline, true):
size_t write(int fd, in char* buf, size_t count)
{
    return syscall3(SYS_WRITE, fd, cast(long) buf, count);
}

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
pragma(inline, true):
void exit(long exit_code){
     syscall1(SYS_EXIT, exit_code);
}

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
void _start()
{
    write(1, "Hello\n", 6);
    exit(0);
}
</pre>


<p>We also need to link this file ourselves so that we don’t pull in any libc dependencies, we do this by using the ‘ld’ command and by just compiling and not linking (the ‘-c’ flag).</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs hello.d syscall.d -c 
ld ./hello.o
ldd ./a.out
         not a dynamic executable</code></pre>



<p>Cool so we now have a statically linked executable that has no dependence on the standard C library! How much did we save?</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./a.out
 13672 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Ugh all that work and only 2k extra savings!  Lets see what is in the executable. We can get this by running ‘readelf -a’ on the executable. Our executable has 9 sections.</p>



<pre><code>[0]
[1] .text
[2] .rodata
[3] .eh_frame
[4] .data
[5] .comment
[6] .symtab
[7] .strtab
[8] .shstrtab</code></pre>



<p>The first that sticks out is the ‘.eh_frame’ section.  That is used for exception unwinding, stack cleanup and other assorted things we don’t need.  We can tell gdc that we don’t want those by adding two flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 9488 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Awesome we just saved 4k, but there is still fat to trim.  One thing we can learn from reading the info pages for ‘ld’ is that there is a flag to help pack executables if you don’t need shared libraries, ‘-n’. Using this saves us about 3k:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld -n ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 6112 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>If we look at the executable with readelf again we can see that the compiler outputs symbols for a lot of things we don’t need:</p>



<p>Symbol table ‘.symtab’ contains 21 entries:<br>Num: Value Size Type Bind Vis Ndx Name<br>0: 0000000000000000 0 NOTYPE LOCAL DEFAULT UND<br>1: 00000000004000b0 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 1<br>2: 00000000004002cf 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 2<br>3: 00000000004012d8 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 3<br>4: 0000000000000000 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 4<br>5: 0000000000000000 0 FILE LOCAL DEFAULT ABS test.d<br>6: 0000000000400187 32 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall0<br>7: 00000000004012e0 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test8SYS_EXITyl<br>8: 000000000040021d 83 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall5<br>9: 00000000004012d8 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test9SYS_WRITEyl<br>10: 00000000004001a7 51 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall2<br>11: 00000000004000b0 47 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 write<br>12: 0000000000400162 37 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 _start<br>13: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 __bss_start<br>14: 00000000004001da 67 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall4<br>15: 0000000000400137 43 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall1<br>16: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _edata<br>17: …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Use this template to ask the user interview questions that drive product and marketing decisions. </p><div><div><p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> Founders, product managers, and UX researchers conducting user research to guide the development of new or improved products.</p>
<p><strong>Why this exists:</strong> Too frequently I see founders and product managers start with a solution and then ask for feedback on it (UX researchers tend to get this right). This doesn’t work. As one user interviewee told me recently, “When I first conducted user interviews all I learned was that everyone loves your product if you ask stupid questions”. </p>
<h2>Template</h2>

<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t15p0nh3y83f/CeL5x9np6vyuBk73RwAV3/afb00c3a7580ec049bd72011a9bcbf19/user_interview_template.xlsx">User interview template</a></p>

<h2>How I Use The Template For User Interviews</h2>
<p>Here’s how I break up a 30-minute user interview:</p>
<p><strong>1. Background and rapport-building [5 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>A successful qualitative user interview should be sincere, vivid, and emotional. To achieve all three of these you need to build a solid foundation with your interviewee. When I'm on the other end of user interviews, I can always tell how experienced the interviewer is by how much they ask about me at the beginning. Experts spend more time getting to know me. We do this to build rapport and understand more about the segment we’re interviewing. For example, in my research, I’ve found that the role of a product manager varies so much between a large and small firms that they’re two completely different segments. Another thing I try to do is earn confidence from the interviewee by proving that I’m well prepared. For example, if I see that the user recently switched roles, or we have a shared connection or interest, I’ll sneak that into this portion.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Nothing. Don't skip this part. You’re about walk the tightrope between interrogation and interview; if you don’t build rapport early on, you’ll plummet into interrogation territory.</p>
<p>Do ask: Can you tell me a little about your role as a Product Manager at Acme Group?</p>
<p><strong>2. Detailed story-collecting questions [20 minutes] </strong></p>
<p>A successful user interview is one where you, as the interviewer, walk away with a collection of vivid stories. As humans, we don’t recognize issues until we talk about specific scenarios and we tend to be terrible at predicting how we will respond to future scenarios. The key to parseing these out is the follow-up questions you ask. One rule of thumb I use is the rule of five whys; try following up a user’s response with “why” until you’ve reached the core of a problem. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: What problems do you encounter when you do x?</p>
<p>Do ask: Tell me about the last time you did x.</p>
<p><strong>3. Product questions [3 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>Once I’ve collected some stories, if I have time, I’ll spend a few minutes describing the hypothesized product and asking questions about it. One of the best things you can do here is to parse out the expectations from the customer; that’s where the gold is. For example, I’ll give a somewhat vague description of the product, and the customer will say, “so does the thing do y”? Which is the perfect time to ask, “would you like it to do y? Why?” Another great question is, “what did you expect?” For example, a user sent me the following email the other day, “I signed up but I’m not quite sure if I was doing it correctly?” My response: “May I ask a question? What did you expect to see that you didn’t?” Turns out, the user expected to see a note that they would get notified when they got a match. During this portion, I'll usually ask questions on a one to ten scale because it forces the customer to examine why they gave a certain rating to something and parses out their hesitations to use the product. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: The product does x, would you use it?</p>
<p>Do ask: On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely) how likely would you be to use the product? Why? On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely), how likely would you be to use the product if it did x? Why?</p>
<p><strong>4. Flywheel-building questions [2 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>By now you’ve built rapport, have some user stories, and the user has a sense of what you’re working on. My favorite questions to ask here are: is there anything I haven’t asked that you think I should be asking? And: do you have any other concerns that we haven’t already talked about? On average, two out of eight respondents will have a question here; when they do it is usually gold because it uncovers something huge that I’ve neglected. Finally, I ask if there’s anyone else that I should be interviewing. This question helps open our blinders to new segments and sometimes leads to a referral for the next user interview.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Anything else?</p>
<p>Do ask: Is there anything I haven’t asked that I should be asking? Do you have any concerns that haven’t been brought up yet? Is there anyone else that you think I should be interviewing for this research?</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, I discuss how to conduct a user interview in the blog post, <a href="https://www.userinterviewexchange.com/blog/how-to-conduct-qualitative-user-interviews">How To Conduct Qualitative User Interviews For Customer Discovery</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>If you’ve ever seen a Kubernetes demo, it probably involved a terminal and someone typing commands using kubectl and arcane yaml configuration files. This might be a powerful workflow for experts, but in an age when everything has a slick web interface, it is not the most accessible user experience. It <strong>steepens the learning curve</strong> for those new to Kubernetes, and <strong>presents a barrier</strong> to occasional users.</p>
<p>Of course, there are several graphical user interfaces available for Kubernetes, including the <em>Kubernetes Dashboard</em> project that is part of upstream Kubernetes itself. However, when we researched the landscape, we couldn’t find a solution that covered everything we were looking for. Specifically, our criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% open source</li>
<li>Actively maintained</li>
<li>Generic, in the sense of not being tied to a specific vendor’s Kubernetes distro</li>
<li>Modular and extensible</li>
<li>Clean, modern user interface</li>
<li>Implemented using a stack that was familiar to our development team (Go, Javascript/Typescript, React)</li>
<li>An interactive UI that allows read-write operations, not just a read-only dashboard</li>
<li>Multi-cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the good number of alternatives, the reality is that none of the solutions we tested at the time really matched all the points in our criteria or was a good base to start from. So, in the time-honored tradition, we decided to build one ourselves…</p>

<p>Today, I am <strong>proud to announce the general availability of a new UI for Kubernetes</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp">Headlamp</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_overview.png" alt="Headlamp"></p>
<p>Headlamp is a generic and extensible Kubernetes UI that meets the criteria mentioned above. Of course, coming from Kinvolk, it is 100% open source. We hope many Kubernetes community members will not just enjoy using Headlamp, but also contribute back to the project.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick spin through some of its core features.</p>
<h2 id="extensible-ui">Extensible UI</h2>
<p>We want Headlamp to be used for as many different use-cases as possible. That includes not only novice Kubernetes users, but also experienced operators, as well as Kubernetes vendors with very different needs. Often, particularly for UI projects, such a breadth of use cases can only be addressed by downstream users maintaining their own fork. But keeping forks up to date becomes more challenging the deeper the changes are.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to have a plugin system. So Headlamp supports out-of-tree UI plugins: Javascript files that are loaded by Headlamp’s backend and passed to the client which dynamically loads them.</p>
<p>This opens up Headlamp to innovation, <strong>fostering a wealth of new functionality</strong>. For example, if you want to add a button to the Pod details view that will redirect the user to a service showing how much the Pod is costing to operate, that should be easy to implement.</p>
<p>We see Headlamp’s plug-in capabilities as a great opportunity for the community. We are eager to collaborate with others who want to develop new Headlamp plugins, or enhance the plugin system itself to support other use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="traceloop">Traceloop</h3>
<p>As an <strong>example of the power of the plug-in system</strong>, and an incredibly useful tool in its own right, we have developed a <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive-web-ui/tree/master/plugins/ig-traces">Headlamp plugin for the traceloop gadget</a> of our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget">Inspektor Gadget</a> project.</p>
<p>When Inspektor Gadget is installed in a cluster and the traceloop gadget is enabled, it <strong>records all syscalls from a pod</strong> into a ring buffer. This buffer can be seen in real-time as the pod is running, allowing a lens into what the pod is doing right now, but is also saved for terminated pods. This allows operators to see what caused a crash, after it happens – like a “flight data recorder” for your Kubernetes apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/traces.gif" alt="Traces plugin for Headlamp"></p>
<h2 id="role-aware-ui">Role-aware UI</h2>
<p>One problem with many read-write (CRUD) user interfaces is that they are not aware of underlying access controls. For example, displaying the update/delete buttons is misleading if the user has actually no permissions to modify the resource. So Headlamp checks Kubernetes RBAC settings and displays only those controls whose actions can be performed. So, if the user does not have permission to edit a resource, the edit button will not be displayed.</p>
<p>This results in a much better UX, because it is obvious to the operator what actions are available based on their permissions at the time. In particular, this is great for situations where time-limited credentials are granted to operators (e.g. temporary deletion permissions on a resource).</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_no_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<h2 id="design--user-interface">Design / User Interface</h2>
<p>We wanted Headlamp’s design to be as <strong>clean and modern</strong> as possible, yet without breaking with a more “traditional” Kubernetes UI or dashboard style. For example, we think that showing a familiar table-based view is very helpful, and we hope other visualizations, such as a graph-based representation of the cluster, can be implemented through plugins.</p>
<p>To implement Headlamp’s frontend, we chose to use React with the <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a> library, because it is modern, clean, and is well maintained with a large user community. It also has the advantage that it is the same technology stack that we use in our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/nebraska">Nebraska</a> project, enabling sharing of expertise and resources, and supporting a consistent UI across all our products.</p>
<h2 id="desktop-vs-in-cluster">Desktop vs In-cluster</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes UIs can be categorized as either a hosted (often in-cluster) backend, such as the original Kubernetes Dashboard, or a local desktop application, such as VMware’s <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant">Octant</a> project.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, when run as a hosted application, it’s very simple to just share a URL with users, and have them log in through OIDC. It’s available “everywhere”, and it’s easy to keep it up-to-date with the cluster version. Conversely, with a desktop application, there’s no need to host the UI application, keeping things more isolated, but the burden of keeping the app up to date falls on the user.</p>
<p>With Headlamp, you <strong>don’t have to choose</strong> between these two approaches, as we support both. It can be easily <strong>hosted in-cluster</strong> by using/adapting the YAML files we provide, or <strong>installed locally</strong> on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cluster-support">Multi-cluster support</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes deployments involve multiple clusters, even if that’s just to separate a development from a production environment. Thus, Headlamp <strong>allows you to access all your clusters</strong> - with the exact method depending on whether you’re running as a hosted, or a local (desktop), application.</p>
<p>When run locally, Headlamp will read the kube config and display the contexts available there, allowing the user to change when needed just by setting the local environment variable to the appropriate cluster.</p>
<p>The way the multi-cluster support works is straightforward: it creates a proxy for each configured cluster, and redirects requests from the UI (with the Kubernetes API calls) to the right cluster address. Shout-out here to the <a href="https://github.com/indeedeng/k8dash">K8dash</a> project, whose request/API management modules we reused in the development of Headlamp.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to mix this with running in-cluster, though this does require the cluster running the application to have API access to the other configured clusters.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_chooser.png" alt="Cluster Chooser" title="Cluster chooser dialog"></p>

<p>You may be aware that Kinvolk also has a Kubernetes distribution, <a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive">Lokomotive</a>. While Headlamp is of course used within Lokomotive as the basis for its web user interface, it is important to note that these are separate and independent projects. True to our goal of being independent of any particular distro, <strong>Headlamp is designed to support any conformant Kubernetes cluster</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy to try out Headlamp</strong>: just apply the deployment manifest to your cluster and point your browser to the Headlamp service, or download and install the desktop application for Windows, Mac, or Linux. For details, see the <a href="https://kinvolk.io/docs/headlamp/latest/installation">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Headlamp is fully open source, released under the Apache 2.0 terms and, as mentioned above, we created it to be a generic and vendor-independent Kubernetes UI that we hope can suit many use-cases. So we encourage anyone interested to take part.</p>
<p>If you want to participate, please check out our <a href="https://kinvolk.io/docs/headlamp/latest/contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We hope you enjoy Headlamp!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bland målen för amerikanska NSA:s avlyssning fanns Saab och den danska försvarskoncernen Terma. Enligt uppgifter till DR, från flera av varandra oberoende källor med insyn i granskningen av den pågående avlyssningsskandalen i Danmark, har NSA fått tillgång till fiberoptiska kablar och ett datacenter på Amager söder om Köpenhamn. Därifrån har man avlyssnat holländsk, norsk, fransk och tysk datatrafik, danska politiska institutioner och svenska försvarsintressen.</p><p>Flera källor pekar ut det svenska Gripen-programmet som ett av målen.</p><h4>Danmark upphandlade nya stridsflyg</h4><p>Det amerikanska spionaget ska, enligt Danmarks radios källor, ha skett samtidigt som den danska staten upphandlade nya stridsflygplan – där Saabs Gripen-plan var med i slutstriden. Danska staten köpte till sist 27 amerikanska F-35-stridsflygplan.</p><p>Danmarks radio har vare sig kunnat styrka eller avfärda att avlyssningen hade ett samband med mångmiljardaffären, detsamma gäller frågan huruvida någon känslig information har röjts. Men enligt experter som SVT och DR talat med kan det röra sig om ekonomiska motiv.</p><h4>Visselblåsare slog larm</h4><p>Den danska skandalen inleddes med att en anställd på FE upptäckte att NSA bedrev olagligt spioneri genom det dansk-amerikanska underrättelsesamarbetet. Efter flera misslyckade försök att uppmärksamma FE:s ledning på problematiken larmade visselblåsaren FE:s tillsynsmyndighet TET.</p><p><span>Myndigheten inledde en undersökning som resulterade i en fyra pärmar tjock rapport. </span><br><span>Materialet från visselblåsaren indikerar, enligt tillsynsmyndigheten TET:s pressmeddelande, att FE:s ledning ”underlåtit att följa upp eller närmare undersöka indikationer på spionage”. Den danska försvarsministern Trine Bramsen tvingade fem personer i FE:s ledning att lämna sina uppdrag.</span></p><h4>Sofistikerad programvara</h4><p>NSA hade fått tillgång till internationella fiberkablar som löper in och ut ur Danmark till bland annat Sverige, USA, England och Tyskland. Kablarna är nyckel i den storskaliga avlyssning som USA och deras allierade bedriver.</p><p>Enligt Danmarks radio har NSA på danska Amager under perioden 2012-2014 upprättat ett datacenter som använder systemet XKeyscore, avslöjat 2013 av Edward Snowden, en central funktion i hela NSA:s avlyssningsapparat. Programmet gör det möjligt att gå igenom stora datamängder i fiberkablar med hjälp av ”selektorer” – sökord som namn på personer i central ställning i intressanta organisationer.</p><p>Enligt källorna fanns selektorer direkt riktade mot Gripenprogrammet och andra försvarsindustriella objekt.</p><p>SVT har i flera omgångar varit i kontakt med Saab som vid ett första möte menade att spionaget inte var anmärkningsvärt och var då beredda att ställa upp på en intervju. Senare ändrade man sig med hänvisning till att man ansåg att uppgifterna kunde misstänkas vara en desinformationskampanj från främmande makt.</p><p>SVT har också varit i kontakt med den amerikanska underrättelsetjänsten NSA som väljer att inte kommentera uppgifterna.</p><p>SVT Nyheter har sökt försvarsminister Peter Hultqvist som avböjer att kommentera uppgifterna.</p><p><em>Vet du mer?

Programmet avslöjades för första gången i samband med Edward Snowden-affären och beskrivs som ett av världens mest sofistikerade övervakningssystem.</p><p>Genom en mycket omfattande datainsamling via bland annat kabelnätverk ger det NSA och deras partners möjlighet att övervaka och söka i information rörandes miljontals människor över hela världen.</p><p>Visselblåsaren Edward Snowden har själv arbetat med XKeyscore. I ett uttalande till The Guardian beskrev han programvaran så här:</p><p>”Jag, sittande vid mitt skrivbord kan avlyssna vem som helst, du eller din revisor, en domare eller till och med presidenten, bara jag har en personlig e-post”.</p><p>NSA:s egen hemliga träningsmanual beskriver hur operatörerna kan få tillgång till NSA:s enorma datalager och söka i vad NSA själva kallar det mest vittomspännande datatrålande system man har tillgång till. En NSA-presentation deklarerar att systemet täcker ”nästan allt en typisk användare gör på internet”.</p><p>Med hjälp av ”selektorer” har underrättelsetjänsterna sökt efter sina mål, däribland Saab.</p><p>Det kan röra sig om en e-postadress, ett telefonnummer eller en telefons id-nummer.</p><p>SVT har som ett av få mediebolag i världen haft mycket god tillgång till <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/referens/ug-referens-snowden-dokumenten-och-sverige">Snowdens läckta</a> material och presenterade det i december 2013. I materialet framgick att FRA liksom FE samarbetar med NSA som har personal och utrustning på plats även i Stockholm, bland annat Xkeyscore. Avslöjandet beskrev också hur NSA och FRA samarbetade med den kombination av spaning som utgör systemets storhet: Xkeyscore kartlade användares nättrafik, bland tekniker på belgiska teleoperatören Belgacom, och med hjälp av trojan-systemet Quantum inserts, där FRA var en viktig partner, sköt in trojaner för att få kontroll över Belgacoms system. Ett system som bland annat betjänar EU-kommissionen.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.svtplay.se/video/29111154/nyheter-direkt/stort-forsvarsavslojande?start=auto">Här kan du se hela direktsändningen på SVT Play. </a></em></p></div></section><section><a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/kallor-till-dr-usa-bedrev-spionage-mot-saab-med-hjalp-av-danska-underattelsetjansten" role="button"></a><div><p>Vet du mer?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Growing up, the only thing that put me off while learning software development, was the common occurrence of people who cared more about one upping others with their trivia knowledge rather than actually building things.</p>
<p>At the start of my career I had a difficult time differentiating between them and actual top performers because the industry still thought there was a strong correlation between jerks and highly productive people. Employers used to be afraid something will go wrong if they fired a mythical 10x engineer and no one else understood how to fix their systems.</p>
<p>After 15 years what I've learned is that engineers that produce orders of magnitude more than others exist<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but the way they are talked about is overly exaggerated. They’re usually not jerks either, at least not more than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>If you find a project where only one person know what is going on, chances are that person is not good at writing code for humans, not that is a coding god.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t often consider is that you don’t have to hire the very top of the field to find people that are orders better than the industry average. Even more important than finding great engineers is to avoid bad ones<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Being obsessed with finding a 10x engineer, is to be obsessed with shortcuts and Hail Marys. It will hurt you in the long run if you’re focusing on that instead of building solid fundamentals.</p>
<p>Ultimately I am convinced that focusing on building teams is more important than finding individual outliers. Of course the John Carmacks, the Jeff Deans, the Fabrice Bellards, of the industry exist, but your startup isn’t going to die if you don’t find one. It will die if you don’t build a good team.</p>
<h2>Good reads on individual and team performance</h2>

<li>McConnell also recognizes the aforementioned studies are not perfect in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/the-origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research/">“Origins of 10X – How Valid is the Underlying Research?”</a>. But the lack of studies contradicting the current findings and the abundance of anecdotal stories signals towards confirmation.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>NEW YORK -- 
	Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax: executives at several American laboratories developing COVID-19 vaccines have recently pocketed millions of dollars by selling shares in their companies -- raising questions about the propriety of such a move in the midst of a global health crisis.</p>
<p>
	On the very day that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced preliminary data showing its vaccine was 90 per cent effective against the coronavirus, its chief executive Albert Bourla sold shares worth US$5.6 million.</p>
<p>
	There was nothing illegal about this, Pfizer said: the sale took place according to rules allowing company heads to sell shares under predetermined criteria, at a date or for a price set in advance, to avoid any suspicion of insider training.</p>
<p>
	Under the same rules, several Moderna officials have sold shares worth more than $100 million in recent months.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank">Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	That company has not placed a single product on the market since its creation in 2010, but the federal government has committed to paying it up to $2.5 billion if its vaccine proves effective.</p>
<p>
	Moderna shares have soared from $19 at the beginning of the year to a current level of $90.</p>
<p>
	The boss of Novavax, for his part, sold $4.2 million in shares on August 18, just over a month after the announcement it would receive public financing of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>
	Accountable US, a nonpartisan taxpayers' advocacy group, has calculated that from the start of the federally coordinated effort to develop vaccines on May 15 until Aug. 31, officials at five pharmaceutical companies made more than $145 million by selling shares.</p>
<h3>
	'LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE'</h3>
<p>
	Executives at Pfizer and Moderna were operating under a rule put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to allow company employees to sell shares without facing insider-trading charges.</p>
<p>
	It allows them to set up a plan determining the trades of their shares at a price, amount or dates specified in advance, but only when they are not in possession of privileged information that could affect share prices.</p>
<p>
	Once such a sale is planned, it cannot be modified at the last minute, even if its timing might ultimately raise questions.</p>
<p>
	Still, this use of the rule by Pfizer and Moderna appears "legally questionable," according to Daniel Taylor, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, who has been studying the big pharma firms since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>
	"The question is, what did the executives know at the time that they pre-scheduled the trade?" he asked.</p>
<p>
	Bourla, according to Pfizer, had merely re-authorized on Aug. 19 a plan for a share sale originally authorized in February, "with the same price and volume terms."</p>
<p>
	But a day after that, the company issued a statement describing the preliminary results of its clinical trials as "positive."</p>
<h3>
	'LEVEL PLAYING FIELD'</h3>
<p>
	It is of course not just normal but desirable that laboratory heads should be encouraged to develop a safe and reliable vaccine as quickly as possible, Taylor said.</p>
<p>
	But "when they are going to sell their shares, they have to make sure that they are operating by the same level playing field, that they're not taking advantage of other investors by having more information," he said.</p>
<p>
	Taylor added a word of caution: "I don't think that companies have internalized the reputational risk to these trades" by selling shares even as COVID-19 cases have been spiraling upward around the world.</p>
<p>
	When a top executive needs to sell shares to pay for a yacht, a new house or his children's education, the public rarely is aware of it. But with the pandemic raging, the laboratories are under intense scrutiny.</p>
<h3>
	HONESTY WITH INVESTORS</h3>
<p>
	For Sanjai Bhagat, a professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder who specializes in corporate governance, top executives should simply not be allowed to sell company shares until a year or two after they leave the company.</p>
<p>
	"If they have a lot of vested stock and stock options, then they have an incentive to get the share price as high as they can, even by not being totally honest with the investing public," he said.</p>
<p>
	Bhagat believes corporate boards should eliminate any chance of temptation.</p>
<p>
	"Not having done anything illegal is not the standard by which they should be judged," he said. "Especially in these times, people are expecting them to act responsibly."</p>
<p>
	Contacted by AFP, the SEC would not say whether it was investigating any of the lab executives.</p>
<p>
	But in an interview in May on the CNBC network, SEC chairman Jay Clayton exhorted executives to respect best practices.</p>
<p>
	"Why would you want to even raise the question that you were doing something that was inappropriate?" he asked.</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p><time datetime="2020-11-16T19:40:14Z">Mon, Nov 16, 2020</time></p><p>A month or so ago, I ended up on on the Waze website – specifically, their “<a href="https://www.waze.com/en-GB/livemap">live map</a>".</p>
<p>As I often do, I found myself poking around Firefox’s developer tools, looking to see which API endpoints the webapp was
interacting with.</p>
<p>I noticed that this particular webapp called an which looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.waze.com/row-rtserver/web/TGeoRSS?bottom=40.73628084811186&amp;left=-74.11780357360841&amp;ma=200&amp;mj=100&amp;mu=20&amp;right=-73.85413169860841&amp;top=40.77825467049393&amp;types=alerts%2Ctraffic%2Cusers
</code></pre><p>The <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>top</code> URL parameters are fairly self explanatory (they define the bounding box over which the
API is queried). <code>types</code> defined the data that should be included in the API call response, and <code>ma</code>, <code>mj</code>, and <code>mu</code> seemed to
specify the maximum number of alerts, jams, and users to be returned.</p>
<p>As it often does, curiosity got the better of me. I tried defining a bounding box that covered the whole planet (by setting
<code>bottom=-90</code>, <code>top=90</code>, <code>left=-180</code> and <code>right=180</code>), and just like that, the API was returning 100+mb of JSON data. This JSON
data included planet-wide user-contributed alerts (excluding the US, which uses a different API endpoint but suffered the same
problem). These alerts are user-contributed notices of traffic jams, police, broken down cars, pot holes and the like.</p>
<p><img src="https://redfern.me/images/waze-alerts.jpeg" alt="Alerts across the planet"></p>
<p>It turned out that the <code>ma</code> parameter was being ignored – users and jams were capped at the specified value (which was limited
server-side at ~300), but there was no upper bound on the number of alerts being returned.</p>
<p>This issue probably doesn’t pose an issue to users, but wasn’t the intended behaviour of the API endpoint – competitors and
other interested parties could trivially harvest all user-contributed Waze data in a single API call.</p>
<p>Waze is owned by Google, so I reported the problem to them via their <a href="https://goo.gl/vulnz">preferred channels</a>. After an initial
misunderstanding about the nature of the issue, they agreed that it was an abuse risk and decided to award a $500 bounty!</p>
<p>The timeline was:</p>
<ul>
<li>09/10/2020: reported issue to Google.</li>
<li>12/10/2020: identified as Abuse Risk.</li>
<li>20/10/2020: issue closed and not tracked as security bug due to inclusion of rate limiting, followed by subsequent
clarification that only single request was needed and rate limiting wasn’t effective in this case.</li>
<li>28/10/2020: confirmation that this was a bug and that it would be filed as such – the issue was fixed within 24hrs of this.</li>
<li>10/11/2020: notification that panel had decided to award bounty of $500 USD.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn’t a very clever bug, nor was it a very severe one. However, it goes to show that minor issues which are fairly
inconsequential to end users can still be (somewhat) valuable to Google.</p>

<p>Many people, when digging into <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/" target="_blank">the PinePhone’s specs</a>,  complain about the low storage, the weak CPU, the lacklustre peripherals…</p>



<p>Naturally, they are missing the point. This is not a phone that you would buy to substitute the supercomputer/surveillance device you already carry around in your pocket. Yes, the memory is small; the pics from the camera are a bit grainy; the battery is removable and decent, but doesn’t last all that long. All this is true.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="542" src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-595x336.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-768x434.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-lazy-srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-595x336.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-768x434.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit.jpg 1500w" data-lazy-src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>The <em>PinePhone – KDE Community Edition with convergence package</em> (USD 199.99)  comes with a (red) cable for flashing and a dock to plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor into your phone (right). SIM and microSD cards not included.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But the specs are low because the manufacturer is working with developers to provide tried-and-tested hardware. “Tried-and-tested” usually also means “old”. Developing an OS and graphical environment is a huge balancing act in which you want to reduce the number of unknowns as much as possible. So you go for what is familiar, with what has been proven to work, with what is well-documented. This usually means hardware that other manufacturers don’t care about any more and that can be safely reverse engineered, has been reverse engineered by others, or has directly had its technical specifications disclosed.</p>



<p>The aim becomes to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kde.org/announcements/pinephone-plasma-mobile-edition/" target="_blank">Plasma Mobile running on basic, well-understood hardware and then build up from there</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this <strong>is</strong> the phone you would buy if you wanted to try out one or several of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.plasma-mobile.org/" target="_blank">fledgling</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ubports.com/" target="_blank">Free and Open Source</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.puri.sm/Librem5/Software_Reference/Environments/Phosh.html" target="_blank">mobile</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://postmarketos.org/" target="_blank">systems</a>. The PinePhone provides you with all the tools you need to try out all and every one of them in an afternoon, making booting and flashing child’s play. Maybe it will even encourage you to help build the future of mobile, be it with code, design ideas, or just bug reports. It is a phone that fosters grassroots, community-driven contributions.</p>



<p>This is by design.</p>



<p>Once a couple things get working reliably in Plasma Mobile, it is also the phone you would buy to protect your privacy, as ALL the software is free and open and can be audited in depth. Want to not worry about spying, leaking proprietary software? This is the phone for you. Plus it even comes with physical hardware kill switches that allow you to turn off its WiFi, microphone, cameras, etc..</p>



<p>Besides, when you use this phone,  you become a proud pioneer of the FLOSS wave that will, one day, take over the mobile world; providing you with a privileged (but affordable) view into what is to come.</p>



<p>So, sure, your friends may brag about their latest iPhones, with their sharp cameras, smooth-as-butter interfaces, and crystalline sounds, while they look down on your modest PinePhone. But the walled-garden, programmed obsolescence and expensive and spying software they have to endure on  devices they don’t even get to own don’t contribute to push the envelope for a better, more humane technology, or make their owners trailblazers in any shape or form. Quite the contrary, they just make them a bunch of deluded iChumps.</p>

Elements can shrink or expand to fit the available space, and are always aligned in a visually pleasing way.</p> <p>MakieLayout doesn't just use simple table layouts like CSS, e.g., because they only work well for simple box-like elements. The restriction to boxes is the main reason why researchers often struggle to make nicely aligned graphics.</p> <p>Instead, MakieLayout extends the table concept with <em>protrusions</em>, which describe the statically sized content "sticking out" of the main elements, like axis decorations. Protrusions become part of the gaps between cell columns by default and don't count when calculating aspect ratios or relative column sizes. This makes it easy to align different subplots along their axes, but also allows for unlimited tweaking, if this default mode is not the right answer.</p> <p>Grid layouts can be nested to arbitrary levels, and can follow aspect ratio, absolute, or relative sizing. This removes the need for a whole class of hacks often used to distribute elements of different sizes in visually pleasing ways.</p> <p>Legends and colorbars in MakieLayout are first-class elements that are not tied to specific axes and can be freely placed anywhere.</p> <p>The example at the beginning involved no layout-tweaking whatsoever. Elements were simply placed in appropriately nested grids, with small aesthetic adjustments of some default settings.</p> <h2 id="interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations"><a href="#interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations">Interactive and Dynamic Visualizations</a></h2> <p>Together with the interactive Makie plotting ecosystem, axes, sliders, buttons and other widgets can be combined to easily create useful applications for data visualization and exploration. The Julia language offers very high performance so interactions are smooth and responsive.</p> <p>In this short demonstration video, you can see how elements are added to and removed from a layout dynamically. Resizing the window recalculates the layout and elements are never overlapping or otherwise misaligned. Plots can be controlled with sliders and buttons, and via a textbox, dynamically calculated function plots are added by specifying the right half of the equation in valid Julia code:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5wsl0dxGhI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p> <h2 id="future_directions"><a href="#future_directions">Future Directions</a></h2> <p>As you can see, even though the Makie ecosystem is still in flux, MakieLayout can be used already to create professional and clean-looking graphics well-suited for publication. The dynamic plotting features based on Observables are easy to use and can save a lot of time when writing quick data exploration tools.</p> <p>In the future, we will focus on making the Makie ecosystem more feature complete and stable. Right now, MakieLayout has to be specifically imported, but we're planning to use it as the default infrastructure for all 2D plots, which should make using it less verbose as well. Although Makie can be compiled via PackageCompiler.jl, it is still a big goal to reduce the relatively long time to first plot, owing to the JIT compilation of Julia.</p> <p>To get started, check out the basic <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/basic-tutorial.html">Makie tutorial here</a>, and once you get the basics, have a look at the <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/makielayout/tutorial.html">MakieLayout tutorial here</a>.</p>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1931, a 25-year-old Kurt Gödel wrote a proof that turned mathematics upside down. The implication was so astounding, and his proof so elegant that it was...kind of funny. I wanted to share his discovery with you. Fair warning though, I’m not a mathematician; I’m a programmer. This means my understanding is intuitive and not exact. Hopefully, that will come to our advantage since I have no choice but to avoid formality 🙂. Let’s get to it.</p><p>For the last 300 years, mathematicians and scientists alike made startling discoveries, which led to one great pattern. The pattern was unification: ideas that were previously thought to be disparate and different consistently turned out to be one and the same!</p><p>Newton kicked this off for physicists when he discovered that what kept us rooted on the Earth was also what kept the Earth dancing around the sun. People thought that heat was a special type of energy, but it turned out that it could be explained with mechanics. People thought that electricity, magnetism, and light were different, but Maxwell discovered they could be explained by an electromagnetic field.</p><p>Darwin did the same for biologists. It turned out that our chins, the beautiful feathers of birds, deer antlers, different flowers, male and female sexes, the reason you like sugar so much, the reason whales swim differently...could all be explained by natural selection.</p><p>Mathematicians waged a similar battle for unification. They wanted to find the “core” principles of mathematics, from which they could derive all true theories. This would unite logic, arithmetic, and so on, all under one simple umbrella. To get a sense of what this is about, consider this question: How do we <em>know</em> that 3 is smaller than 5? Or that 1 comes before 2? Is this a “core” principle that we take on faith (the formal name for this is called an “axiom”) or can this be derived from some even more core principle? Are numbers fundamental concepts, or can they be derived from something even more fundamental?</p><p>Mathematicians made great progress in this battle for core principles. For example, a gentleman called Frege discovered that he could craft a theory of sets, which could represent just about everything. For numbers, for example, he could do something like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkyOTc0LWZhMTE3MjgwLTI4MGYtMTFlYi05MTM1LTVkYjRkZWFlZjgzYy5wbmc" alt="A demonstration of how to represent numbers with sets"></span></p><p>Here, he represents 0 the empty set. 1 as the set which contains the set for 0. 2 as the set that contains the set for 1 and 0. From this he could set a principle to get the “next” number: just wrap all previous numbers in a set. Pretty cool! Frege was able to take that and prove arithmetic rules like “1 + 1”, “numbers are infinite”, etc.</p><p>This looked formidable and cool, but Bertrand Russell came along and broke the theory in one fell swoop. </p><p>He used the rules that Frege laid out to make a valid but <em>nonsensical</em> statement. He proved something analogous to 1 + 1 = 3 <sup>1</sup>. This sounds innocuous; it was after-all just <em>one</em> statement. But nevertheless it was disastrous for a foundational theory of mathematics. If you could prove that 1 + 1 = 3, then you can’t really trust any true statement that results from this foundation. </p><p>This put mathematicians on a tail-spin. They even dubbed this period the “Foundational Crisis of Mathematics” </p><p>In an effort to solve this problem, a mathematician called Hilbert laid down some requirements for what a fundamental theory of mathematics had to look like <sup>2</sup>. He said that this theory must be a new language, with a set of rules that satisfied two primary constraints:</p><p>The theory would need to be able to prove <em>any</em> true mathematical statement. For example, imagine the statement 1 + 1 = 2. If this language can’t prove that statement, then it certainly can’t prove all of mathematics. Hilbert called this quality <strong>completeness.</strong> The language would need to be complete. </p><p>The second hard requirement, as we discussed earlier, was that it <em>could not</em> prove a false mathematical statement. If we could prove 1 + 1 = 3, then all was for naught. Hilbert called this <strong>consistency.</strong> The language would need to be consistent.</p><p>Bertrand Russell, the gentleman who broke Frege’s theory, worked together with Alfred North Whitehead to develop a theory of their own. They labored for years to craft an immense volume of work, called Principia Mathematica <sup>3</sup>.</p><p>They started by writing a new language (let’s call it PM) with a few simple rules. They took those rules,  and proceeded to prove a bunch of things. Russell and Whitehead took almost nothing on faith. For example, let’s look at this almost-impossible-to-read proof over here (don’t worry, you don’t need to understand the syntax for this essay):</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkzMDA0LTA0Y2MwNzgwLTI4MTAtMTFlYi05ZGJkLTRkMTlmYmQxMDM2My5wbmc" alt="An example, very hard-to-read proof from Principia Mathematica"></span></p><p>This proof showed that “1 + 1”, does indeed equal “2”. It took 2 volumes to get here.</p><p>Their language was dense and the work laborious, but they kept on proving a whole bunch of different truths in mathematics, and so far as anyone could tell at the time, there were no contradictions. It was imagined that at least in theory you could take this foundation and eventually expand it past mathematics: could you encode in pure logic how a dog behaves, or how humans think?</p><p>It certainly looked like Principia Mathematica could serve as the foundational theory for Mathematics. Until Gödel came along. </p><p>He proved that Principia Mathematica <em>did indeed have</em> true mathematical statements which <em>could not be proven</em> in the language. Principia Mathematica was incomplete.</p><p>This was startling, but his proof went even further. He showed that the entire enterprise behind Hilbert’s Program — to find a formal foundation for mathematics — could <em>never</em> work.</p><p>It’s hard to believe that a person could really prove that something can “never” happen — imagine if someone told you that we could never travel farther than our solar system — you’d look at them with suspicion.</p><p>Yet here Gödel was...a 25 year-old who proved beyond a doubt that this enterprise was impossible. He did this by showing that if a language could represent numbers, then unprovable statements would necessarily pop up.</p><p>Let’s think about that for a second: Numbers seem so quaint and easy to prove —  just “1”, “2”, “3”...so on. People thought we could eventually write down how humans think — imagine how shocked they must have been to see that we couldn’t prove all truths about...numbers.</p><p>Let’s see how Gödel did it.</p><p>Now Russel and Whitehead’s language was hard to read. There’s no harm done in changing some of their symbols around. Let’s map their language to something more amenable to programmers: Lisp! </p><p>You can imagine that Russell and Whitehead came up with a lisp-like language. Here’s how their syntax looked:</p><p>First, they had a few symbols for arithmetic.</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>zero</p></td><td><p><code>0</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>next</p></td><td><p>the next successor</p></td><td><p><code>(next 0)</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>plus</p></td><td><p><code>(+ 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>*</p></td><td><p>times</p></td><td><p><code>(* 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>=</p></td><td><p>equals</p></td><td><p><code>(= 0 (* 0 (next 0)))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Just from these symbols, they could represent all natural numbers. If they proved that the symbol <code>0</code> worked like 0. and the symbol <code>next</code> worked like a successor function, then <code>(next 0)</code> could represent 1, <code>(next (next 0))</code> could represent 2, and so on. </p><p>Here’s how they could write <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>+</span><span> (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>) (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)) </span>
<span>   (</span><span>next</span><span> (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)))</span></code></pre><p>Now, for the purpose of this essay, I’ll add one rule. If you ever see me using a natural number inside PM-Lisp other than 0 (i.e “15”), you can imagine it’s shorthand to writing <code>(next (next (next ...))))</code> that many times. In this case, “15” means <code>next</code> applied to 0, 15 times</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>&lt;natural-number&gt;</code></p></td><td><p><code>(next (next ...))</code> applied to <code>0</code> <code>&lt;natual-number&gt;</code> times</p></td><td><div><p><code>3</code></p><p><em>means</em> <code>(next (next (next 0)))</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>(Next (pun-intended)), they came up with some symbols to represent logic: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>not</p></td><td><p>not</p></td><td><p><code>(not (= 0 1))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>or</p></td><td><p>or</p></td><td><p><code>(or (= 0 1) (not (= 0 1)))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>when</p></td><td><p>when ... then ..</p></td><td><div><p><code>(when 0 (or 0 1))</code></p><p><em>when 0, then there is either 0 or 1</em></p></div></td></tr><tr><td><p>there-is</p></td><td><p>there is ... such that ...</p></td><td><p><code>(there-is x (= 4 (* x 2))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These symbols map closely to the logical statements we are used to in programming. The most unusual one is <code>there-is</code>. Let’s see one of those for an example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>there-is</span><span> x (</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span> (</span><span>*</span><span> x </span><span>2</span><span>)))</span></code></pre><p>This is making a statement, that there is some number <code>x</code>, such that <code>(* x 2)</code> equals 4.  Well, that is indeed true: <code>x = 2</code>. That’s pretty cool — we’ve just made a general arithmetic statement. </p><p>Where did the <code>x</code> come from though? Oops, we need to account for that in our language:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>a...z, A...Z</p></td><td><p>variable</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In order to represent general truths, Russell and Whitehead introduced variables. Here’s how they could derive <code>and</code> for example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>not</span><span> (</span><span>or</span><span> (</span><span>not</span><span> A) (</span><span>not</span><span> B)))</span></code></pre><p>When this statement is <code>true</code>, both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> must be true! </p><p>Very cool. One more trick for our essay. To make it a bit easier to read, sometimes I’ll introduce new symbols. They won’t actually be a part of the language, but it can make good shorthand for us in the essay</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Form</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(def &lt;name&gt; &lt;formula&gt;)</code></p></td><td><p>define <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> to represent <code>&lt;formula&gt;</code></p></td><td><div><p><code>(def and (not (or (not A) (not B)))</code></p><p><em>same as</em> <code>(and &lt;var-a&gt; &lt;var-b&gt;...)</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now we can write <code>(and 1 2)</code> 🙂</p><p>All we saw above were <em>symbols.</em> They had no meaning yet. </p><p>Russell and Whitehead needed to prove that <code>0</code> works like zero, and that <code>=</code> works like equals. In order to breathe life into those symbols, they started off with some core principles — the axioms. </p><p>Here’s what they chose: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Axiom</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p p) p)</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or apples, then apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when p (or p q))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples, then either apples or bananas</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p q) (or q p))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or bananas, then either bananas or apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p (or q r)) (or q (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples, bananas, or pears, then either bananas, apples, or pears</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (when q r) (when (or p q) (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples are a fruit, then bananas or apples implies bananas or fruits</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>That’s it. This is all we needed to take them on faith for. They took these rules and laboriously combined them in intricate ways to derive everything else. </p><p>For example, here’s how they derived <code>=</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> = (</span><span>and</span><span> (</span><span>when</span><span> A B) (</span><span>when</span><span> B A)))</span></code></pre><p>If A implies B, and B implies A, they <em>must</em> be equal! Imagine this done for hundreds and hundreds of pages. </p><p>Note something essential here: their rules are so precise that there is no room for human judgement; a computer could run them. This was a key component for …</p></span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.community.com/">Community</a> we use <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, a lot. It’s the infrastructure backbone that allows our services (over fourty at this point) to communicate with each other. That mostly happens through <strong>events</strong> (since we have an event-sourced system), but in some cases what we need is a <em>request-response</em> interaction between two services. This is the best tool in a few use cases, like retrieving data on the fly or asking a service to do something and return a response. An industry standard for such interactions is HTTP, but we are not big fans of that. Instead, since RabbitMQ is so ubiquitous in our system, we settled on using it for request-response interactions as well in the form of <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPCs). In this post, I’ll go over the architecture of such interactions, the RabbitMQ topologies we use to make them work, the benefits around reliability and the compromises around performance, and finally how this all implemented to be as fault-tolerant as possible with Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpc">What is an RPC</h2>

<p>An RPC can be seen as a function call across sytem boundaries, instead of at the code execution level. An RPC allows you to call a <em>procedure</em> on another service and treat it mostly like a local function call (with the additional error handling to account for the network interaction).</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of caller and receiver of an RPC" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-30-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rpc-definition.png"></p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail about RPCs themselves, but you’re probably familiar with a common form of RPC: HTTP. HTTP request-response interactions between services in a service-oriented architecture are essentially RPCs, they’re just less explicit on the fact that they’re <em>calling a procedure</em>. One of the benefits of RPCs is, like HTTP, that they are agnostic of technologies. A services written in Elixir can make an RPC (or HTTP request) to a service written in Go, for example. If you want to read more about RPCs, their definition, their benefits, and more, guess where I’ll link you to? Exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, I will refer to the services involved in an RPC as the <strong>caller service</strong> and the <strong>receiver service</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-rpcs-over-rabbitmq">Why RPCs over RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>At Community, we chose to do RPCs over RabbitMQ, instead of the common service-to-service communication via HTTP, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we want to use message queues as often as possible. When you have a queue-based message broker between services that talk to each other, the availability requirements of the services can be less demanding. If you have two services that communicate over HTTP, then if the receiver service is down it means that the requester service will not get a response and will have to implement request retries in order to increase the chances of a successful request. With RabbitMQ in the middle, if the receiver is down then the RPC is queued and can be picked up once the receiver comes back up.</p>

<p>Another important reason that influenced our decision is that we make heavy use of RabbitMQ for all sorts of things. This means our engineer know it well, our infrastructure is solid, and we have good systems to trace and observe messages flowing through it.</p>

<p>One compromise we had to make is that, generally speaking, RPCs over RabbitMQ tend to be <em>slower</em> than direct service-to-service communication (such as HTTP). This is hard to avoid given that in our case we have a message broker sitting between the caller service and the receiver service. That means that you’ll <em>at least</em> have twice the RTT (round-trip time) on the network, since the messages you’re sending and receiving need to jump through one more hop than if you do direct service-to-service communication. However, when we do RPCs the bottleneck is rarely the network or the message broker, and instead tends to be the processing of the RPC itself. So, we’re fine with the compromise here.</p>

<h2 id="rabbitmq-topology">RabbitMQ topology</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>RabbitMQ topology</strong> that powers our RPC system. We have the following components in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>headers</em> exchange called <code>rpc</code>. Caller services publish RPCs to this exchange with two headers, <code>destination</code> (the receiver service name) and <code>procedure</code> (the procedure name).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Per-service queues where RPCs end up. Their name usually looks like <code>receiver_service.rpcs</code>. A single queue is shared across multiple <em>instances</em> (nodes) of the same service. All the running instances of the receiver service consume from this queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binding between each per-service queue and the <code>rpc</code> exchange. Since <code>rpc</code> is a headers exchange, the binding happens on the headers. Most commonly, receiver services bind their queue to the <code>rpc</code> exchange on the <code>destination: receiver_service_name</code> header, but sometimes we can be more flexible and specific by also using the <code>procedure</code> header.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A per-instance <em>response queue</em> where responses to RPCs are published by the receiver service. Each <em>instance</em> of the caller service consumes from its dedicated response queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an artistic representation of the RabbitMQ topology. This one is for you, my visual friends.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of RabbitMQ topology" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-30-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rabbitmq-topology.png"></p>

<h2 id="caller-architecture">Caller architecture</h2>

<p>Our focus when designing this architecture <em>was not</em> performance. Since our system is event-sourced, when services need to access data <em>fast</em>, we usually have alternatives to RPCs. In those cases, instead of fetching data from another service via RPC, a service can usually build a “local” data store (usually Redis, but whatever fits best) by consuming events and have fast access to that data store. However, this doesn’t cover use cases where a service wants to ask another service to do something and return a result. This can be usually also be done via asynchronous events, but sometimes it really can’t and in any case we like the agility of RPCs for when we’re moving fast and don’t want to commit to particular data exchanges in the long term.</p>

<p>Instead, we heavily focused on reliability and resource utilization. We want our RPCs to succeed whenever they can. We also want to limit RabbitMQ resource utilization as much as possible, since the message broker architecture shares the broker between all the services that use it.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we came up with the topology described above. In the sketch below, I’m focusing on the caller service perspective.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of the architecture of the sender service" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-30-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-caller-architecture.png"></p>

<p>This is what happens, step by step, when a service makes an RPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The caller assigns a new UUID to the request and encodes the request (we happen to use Protobuf, but anything would work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller includes the name of the <em>response queue</em> in the <code>reply_to</code> metadata field of the RabbitMQ message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller publishes the request on the main RPC exchange (<code>rpc</code>) using headers to specify the <code>destination</code> and <code>procedure</code> to call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If publishing the request is successful, the caller stores the request in an in-memory key-value store (ETS for Elixir and Erlang folks), storing the mapping from request ID to caller process. This is used to map responses back to requests when they come back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller has a pool of AMQP channels also consuming from the response queue. When the response comes back on such queue, a consumer channel picks it up, finds the corresponding caller process from the in-memory key-value store, and hands the caller process the response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From a code standpoint, an RPC really does look like a function call. The main difference is that an RPC can <em>definitely</em> fail due to the network interaction, so we always make sure to return a successful value or an error value. In Elixir, that translates to <code>{:ok, response}</code> or <code>{:error, reason}</code> tuples. In a typed language (say Haskell) it would be the “either” type. In Elixir-flavoured pseudocode, this is what an RPC looks like from the caller side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>RPCPool</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>"my_receiver_svc"</span><span>,</span> <span>"add"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"args"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]})</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"result"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>result</span><span>}}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>#=&gt; 13</span>

  <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>reason</span><span>}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>"failed because: </span><span>#{</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>reason</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>#=&gt; such as :timeout</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-response-queue">The response queue</h3>

<p>It’s worth focusing on the <strong>response queue</strong>. This queue is declared by all AMQP channels in the caller pool when they start up. This is a common pattern in RabbitMQ since declaring resources (queues, exchanges, and bindings) is <em>idempotent</em>, that is, you can do it as many times as you want and the resource is declared only once.</p>

<p>The response queue is declared with a key property: <code>auto_delete</code>. When this property is present, a queue is deleted as soon as there are no channels consuming from it anymore. This is exactly the behavior we want: as long as a caller pool is “up and running”, there’s gonna be at least one channel consuming from the queue and handing responses over to caller processes. However, if the whole pool or the whole node for the caller goes down then the queue will be deleted. This works perfectly, because if the caller node goes down, then we likely lost the “context” of the requests, and even if the node will come back up then it won’t know what to do with the responses anymore. As <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">one RabbitMQ documentation page</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reply messages sent using [RPC] are in general not fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that published the original request subsequently disconnects. The assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit another request in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, we allow RabbitMQ to clean itself up and avoid leaving garbage in it, without writing any code to do so.</p>

<p>The code for each AMQP channel that consumes responses goes something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>channel</span> <span>=</span> <span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Channel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>amqp_connection</span><span>)</span>

<span># "response_queue" is determined per-pool.</span>
<span># Usually it looks like: "caller_service.#{UUID.generate()}"</span>
<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Queue</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>,</span> <span>auto_delete:</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Basic</span><span>.</span><span>consume</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a response comes back, the caller does a key lookup on the response’s request ID in the in-memory key-value data store to retrieve the original request and moreover the process that’s waiting on the response. It looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>handle_rabbitmq_message</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>decode!</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>
  <span>caller_process</span> <span>=</span> <span>KVStore</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>re…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> is probably the most unintuitive scientific theory in the history of humankind—nothing behaves like we are used to. In this essay, we will try to get back some intuition of how to think about quantum mechanics, more specifically the quantum random walk. No worries, there are going to be <em>no equations</em>—this is not a scientific paper. The main purpose of this essay is to make the reader curious by showing how weird our reality is and how this knowledge might help us in the future.</p><p>Most people are familiar with the classical random walk which is a mathematical framework used to describe a lot of phenomena—e.g. Stock-prices and Brownian motion. The quantum random walk is less known and not as useful for explanations, but there are some interesting fields it might get more important in. The most notable cases are quantum computing—specifically Grover’s Algorithm—and quantum biology. The later field is the study of how and why quantum mechanics is important for explaining biology and it is still a pretty new and often controversial field.</p><h2 id="classical">Classical</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">classical random walk</a> in one dimension can be thought of as flipping a coin and going one step forward (+1) if it shows heads and one step backward (-1) if it shows tails. This is the simplest version of the random walk but it is sufficient to illustrate some important concepts.</p><p>The first thing to note is that probabilities approach a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> (Gaussian). After one coin flip—T=1 steps—we find ourselves with the probability of 1/2 at 1 and with the probability of 1/2 at -1. After T=2 steps we find ourselves with a probability of 1/4 at 2, with the probability of 1/4 at -2, and with the probability of 1/2 at 0 (Figure 3). By continuing this sequence, we can see the normal distribution emerging.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586508603527-Q4JJL2080G6VZWKF1M1Q/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIjS6q4cv5cYFkTz_escvjFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVHk1kd5ZhDKaoPBq5dMMgNiLIFqjsmkQkqMmAV2uYMQkty480UlKOY0DP3Mqxn-Omk/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w" alt="The random walk can be visualized with Galton’s Board."></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509218902-IQ5G4Z3K1RGD1VFKIV0J/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC4WqmtwEkHAKs-GAMAt7IJZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIMY-uRSxFfrlmpPcZO_V5RxeWyHosL0CxVv30qiNAUhM/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.00.08.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a classical random walk"></figure><p>One important but counter-intuitive fact is that after T steps the average distance from our starting point (0) is not 0. You might expect that if we always move +1 or -1, we would on average not move way from the start (0), but that is not the case. The average distance from our start after T steps is roughly √(T). We will not prove this fact since I promised not to use equations but we will at least see why 0 is the wrong answer.</p><p>The distance from our starting point can never be negative—a distance is only ever be positive. Even if we find ourselves after T=2 at the point -2, the distance to our starting point (0) is not -2 but 2. Put differently, it does not matter in which direction you go, you cannot be -5 meters away from your home (try it at home). Starting from this point, the interested reader can figure out (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#One-dimensional_random_walk">or lookup</a>) why the average distance is of the order of √(T).</p><h2 id="quantum">Quantum</h2><p>For a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk">quantum random walk</a>, we need what I will call a “quantum coin”; it is a fair coin that just like the classical one has the probability of 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails. Note that this quantum coin does not exist and in reality and the “coin flip” is a mathematically defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_transformation_(quantum_mechanics)">unitary operation</a> manipulating the state of a system—spin—in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>. We will use the balanced—fair—quantum coin named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk#Discrete_time">Hadamard coin</a> for our example. The most important thing to understand here is that we have defined this coin to be fair. When we flip it, we get heads half of the time and tails the other half of the time. As with our classical coin, we will move one step forward (+1) if it lands on heads and one step backward (-1) if it lands on tails. After T=1 flips (or steps) we will be at 1 with the probability of 1/2 and at -1 with the probability of 1/2. So far, so good—everything is behaving “classically.”</p><p>Now comes the weird part, instead of measuring after each step, we will measure only at the end—let us say, after T=5 flips. This represents, in a way, the quantum version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine">Galton’s Board</a>. If everything behaved classically, it would not make a difference if we looked—i.e. measured—after every step or just at the end, but since we are dealing with weird quantum mechanics it makes a huge difference. The probability distribution looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509307347-UCS5QF91ZOP00Q86H56T/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJOa5YPqCmGvzx7mCN2r0EdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIsiIvZpik36d-7psP9EKVUlUUi2YiCCZOvvpVrdTT-CE/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.01.06.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a quantum walk"></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586526747838-SHOBBHF1UHDH1H2UI1LD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOLb81ARpkFxFMv5Mbr56oVZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVEEkvzdRL4CfH2OmtAD12M-DuTV5gn_3pnKAHtbVSWOI91lH3P2bFZvTItROhWrBJ0/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution visualized"></figure><p>Keep in mind that to measure the probabilities for T=5, we are only allowed to measure after those 5 flips—never in-between. To get the probabilities for the other steps we need to measure only after e.g. T=3 but we cannot continue the experiment afterward and measure T=5.</p><p>Looking at the table (Figure 4), we can see a couple of interesting things. First, the distribution starts to differ from the classical one after T=3. Second, the distribution is not symmetric; in this case, it is skewed to the left (negative) side. This is the case because we started with the initial state “spin down”. In our coin analogy, this corresponds to which side is facing upwards <em>before</em> you flip the coin. Take a moment to appreciate how unbelievable this is.</p><p>We defined the coin so it has exactly 1/2 chance of landing on heads and 1/2 of landing on tails; and if we look after one flip, it works perfectly and it does not matter in which initial condition the coin was—i.e. which side was facing upward before the flip. But if we only look after T=5 flips, it matters a lot in which initial condition the coin was; it is suddenly important which side of the coin was facing upwards before we flipped it. This is because of a phenomenon at the heart of Quantum Mechanics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference">interference</a>.</p><p>If we do the experiment with our system having “spin up” we will get the same distribution skewed to the right. To get a symmetrical distribution, we have to put the system into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a> of the two states “spin up” and “spin down.” Superposition means that the system is in both states at the same time and only when we “measure” it, the system decides the state. In our analogy, we have to prepare the coin so that it lies with heads up and tails up at the same time. This is, obviously, not possible with a real coin but doable with a quantum system.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586529134138-8UG2L02UHXH0YUZI861S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGsLnSpN9SmgRY0kKOgjdudZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVFCeGs_oZuelCVw0HtcXhz3OCHUHA_lcJEJorkwU3xVcmbSd6kfRtgWHgNMDgGnmDY/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a Hamard walk with a superposition of initial conditions"></figure><p>The most interesting and useful feature of the quantum walk is that in contrast to the classical walk, the expected distance from the origin is not √(T) but T. This means that a quantum walk is quadratically faster than a classical random walk. In T flips—steps—we expect to find ourselves at the distance T from the start. This is incredible. One cannot understand this feature by thinking “classically.” We can only imagine that the quantum random walk is not going +1 <em>or</em> -1 at each step but rather <em>both</em> at the same time and the system only decides on one alternative when being measured (this mixture of superposition and interference makes everything extremely counter intuitive). Now, let us see why is it useful to know about this weird quantum random walk.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: another big difference to the classical random walk can be seen by adding an absorption barrier. While the classical walk has the probability of p=1 to be eventually absorbed, the quantum walk has, as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">this paper</a>, a chance of escaping to infinity.)</p><h2 id="grover-s-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h2><p>Searching through lists and sorting them is one of the most popular tasks computers nowadays perform. Finding fast search and sorting algorithms is getting increasingly important because the amount of available data is skyrocketing and unsearchable or unsorted databases are mostly useless. This is where—in theory—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> comes in; it is a quantum algorithm for searching an item in an unsorted list. Only in theory because a good enough quantum computer has not been build yet and scaling up from the ones we have already build is not trivial.</p><p>If you want to find a particular item in a list with N items classically, you need to check all N items—N evaluations—because the item you are searching for could be the last in the list. (If you are sure that the item is in the list, the correct number of evaluations is N-1, but this does not matter much here.) This means searching through an unsorted database with N entries takes—classically—N steps. However, with Grover’s quantum algorithm—which can be viewed as a quantum random walk—it takes √(N) steps. It allows for the same quadric speedup as the quantum random walk. For large databases—lists with big N— this can mean a lot fewer evaluations.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: it is sadly (or luckily?) not possible to solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time with this algorithm.)</p><h2 id="photosynthesis">Photosynthesis</h2><p>In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge</a>, Johnjoe McFadden and Jim Al-Khalili argue that quantum physics is needed to explain biological phenomena. One of the most important processes in biology is photosynthesis which, according to the authors, probably relies on the quantum random walk since such efficient transportation seems difficult to explain otherwise. However, quantum biology is a new and often controversial field and I am sadly not in the position to judge the credibility of this claim because my knowledge of biology is rudimentary at best.</p><p>Some people believe that uncovering this mechanism of nature can help us build technologies that more efficiently convert the energy of sunlight into electric energy and I hope they are right. For those who are interested, I can highly recommend the already mentioned book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge.</a></p><h2 id="curious">Curious?</h2><p>I hope this essay has shown the reader how weird our world at the smallest scale behaves without asking for many technical prerequisites. I have done my best to keep the explanations as intuitive as possible which is why I had to omit many details. For the interested reader, I would suggest “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">Quantum random walks: An introductory overview</a>” by J. Kempe as a further reading—it is also the source for most of the figures. Keep in mind that you will need a decent amount of mathematical and physical background knowledge to understand it though. Having said this, I hope that my essay made some people curious about our world and that is all I can ask for.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

		<p>From The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/">The Next Decade Could Be Even Worse: A historian believes he has discovered iron laws that predict the rise and fall of societies. He has bad news.</a></p>
<p>Turchin’s core argument ,based on data mining and mathematical modeling, is that an overproduction of elites will lead to societal unrest and collapse in the US, that should unfold soon. This occurs in cycles of 50 or so years.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Certain aspects of this cyclical view require relearning portions of American history, with special attention paid to the numbers of elites. The industrialization of the North, starting in the mid-19th century, Turchin says, made huge numbers of people rich. The elite herd was culled during the Civil War, which killed off or impoverished the southern slaveholding class, and during Reconstruction, when America experienced a wave of assassinations of Republican politicians. (The most famous of these was the assassination of James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, by a lawyer who had demanded but not received a political appointment.) It wasn’t until the Progressive reforms of the 1920s, and later the New Deal, that elite overproduction actually slowed, at least for a time.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
This oscillation between violence and peace, with elite over­production as the first horseman of the recurring American apocalypse, inspired Turchin’s 2020 prediction. In 2010, when Nature surveyed scientists about their predictions for the coming decade, most took the survey as an invitation to self-promote and rhapsodize, dreamily, about coming advances in their fields. Turchin retorted with his prophecy of doom and said that nothing short of fundamental change would stop another violent turn.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t agree with his forecasts at all, and I take the opposite position that  America is in a prolonged   period of  prosperity,  peace, and  dominance (esepcially relative to the rest of the world since 2008) that may last indefinitely. By investing in US stocks, you are making an indirect bet in this trend continuing, but if Turchin is right, the best investment would probably be treasury bonds, which are yielding very little now (so there is very little profit potential). But I can say with 100% certainty that my forecast is way more likely to be accurate than Turchin’s. Shorting the market is not an option , owing to path tendency and possible insolvency from being ‘too early’. </p>
<p>Turchin blames an ‘over-production of elites’ for impending unrest, yet it is not so much that all college grads aspire to elite positions but rather seek the higher wages and nicer lifestyle that a college degree bestows. And as long as the college wage premium keep widening, we should expect more college grads and higher tuition costs. If the premium was to suddenly contract, then college enrolment would fall and there would be fewer production of these elites. </p>
<p>Even if empires cyclically rise and fall within certain fixed or predictable intervals, there are many factors protecting the US from such collapse, and when such factors are combined make the possibly far more remote than quantitative historical analysis would suggest:</p>
<p>1. Considerable ethnic, cultural, religious, and economic diversity , which makes it harder to foment revolution and increases political and economic stability even if such diversity leads to local tensions, such as black-on-white crime. </p>
<p>Vox Day and others argue that increased diversity will lead to unrest and the break-up of America, but I have <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/does-diversity-proximity-lead-to-war-probably-not-as-far-as-the-us-is-concerned/">argued</a> it is a prophylactic against such unrest. Civil wars and revolution are typically engendered by homogenous groups against a second group cut from the same ethnic and racial cloth. The Revolutionary War pitted New England against Britain. The Civil War pitted Anglo Protestants up North against Anglo Protestants from the South. The Iranian revolution pitted anti-Western Iranian religious fundamentalists against pro-Western Iranian rulers.   </p>
<p>Also, if diversity is supposed to be destabilizing, why would elites push for it? Why would elites support policy that would lead to their undoing and loss of power and wealth as the US collapses due to war arising from such diversity? That makes no sense. This is an obvious logical contradiction that many dissidents such as Vox and others cannot account for. </p>
<p>Although small, homogenous countries can prosper for a long time (the Nordic countries for example), I believe that homogeneity makes such countries more vulnerable if the right conditions are met (economic downturns, war, indebtedness, inflation, etc.). This was the case during the French and Russian revolutions, in which debts due to war caused high unemployment and basic needs not being met for large swaths of the population.</p>
<p>2. Highly productive and large ‘smart fraction’ (discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/the-iq-debate/">earlier</a>) under optimal economic and social conditions, which is a major contributing factor for America’s economic dominance and strength, especially since 2008. </p>
<p>3. Large geographic size. Similar to #1, this makes it hard for aggrieved, disenfranchised groups to collectively rise up, as everyone is literally all spread out.</p>
<p>4. Unparalleled, unrivaled  military and economic dominance relative to the rest of the developed world, even China. The British Empire, during its height in the early 20th century, was in  relatively much weaker position than the US is in now, and faced major competitors such as France, Germany, The Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, etc. The only major possible competitor or comparable strength is China, which does not have imperial ambitions. </p>
<p>5. Foreign competitors have no imperial ambitions, unlike centuries ago when Spain, France, the Netherlands, England, Germany, Portugal, Ottoman Empire, etc. were all vying for control (especially of India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America):</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/debitage.net/humangeography/images/Colonialism_1914.png"></p>
<p>In spite of all the sabre rattling, China has no imperial ambitions.  So many people are predicting an imminent ‘clash of the civilizations’ between the US and China. I think nothing of that sort will happen and there will be continued peace, with the occasional tough talk and posturing and threats such as Trump’s tariffs and ‘trade war’ (which was more media hype than a war) that gets a lot of media coverage, but nothing substantive happens. In regard to purported expansionism, China has done very little actual expansion. The annexation of Tibet was 70 years ago. The last incident of expansion could technically be in in 1997 when Hong Kong was transferred to China from Britain.</p>
<p>6. America’s large bureaucracy and its constitutional republic composed to hundreds of Congressmen and Senators creates a lot of redundancy and limits the damage any one individual can do, unlike aristocracies and nobilities, which are more centralized and have point of failure. Yet at the same time, in spite of this large federal government and also numerous state governments, the private sector has a lot of autonomy, with the federal government only interceding during crisis but otherwise tending to keep an hands-off approach, although the Covid shutdowns are a possible exception to this.  </p>
<p>7. A large middle class and high standards of living, further making revolution and mass unrest unlikely even if there are occasional outbursts such as BLM protests. </p>
<p>I don’t think Turchin’s research is of any useful predictive value. I don’t know why his ideas have gotten so much attention when there are so many obvious methodological problems and dubious assumptions, such as that history must cycle or that empires must fall. The problem with making such inferences based on historical trends and patterns is that the circumstances for each country, throughout history, are unique and it is hard to generalize. You can say “going back 2000 years, empires and regimes on average last 200-400 years,” but there is no immutable law that says it must be less than 400 years. It can be 4,000 or 40,000 under the right circumstances, for all we know.  Because the conditions are so vague and the time frames are so long, it is hard to quantifiably and objectively test Turchin’s ideas. Mathematics typically tries to make things precise, yet history is imprecise in nature, so attempting to merge these things probably yields the worst of both. </p>

And they’re all accessible - just 280 characters away.</p><h4>LinkedIn</h4><p>LinkedIn is a content-deficient platform - there’s more demand for quality content than supply.</p><p>And pretty much all product and engineering leaders spend time on the platform.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjones4413/">Feel free to connect</a> and shoot me a message! 🙂</p><h4>SEO</h4><p>In the early days, I can hustle my way to 20-30% month-over-month growth.</p><p>But when 20% growth requires adding 20+ new companies, I need to be able to rely on more scalable channels.</p><p>I’m optimistic that SEO will be my best sustainable growth driver in the long-term.</p><h4>The product</h4><p>Eventbrite’s product was inherently viral.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>T</span>he wind shifts. The stench of rotten eggs makes it nearly impossible to breathe and the hot fog clouds my view. I hold my breath and close my eyes, imagining the fog growing thicker, crushing me. Then without warning the wind clears and Iâ€™m enveloped once again in the cold, dry air. The heat feels like a lost dream. I shiver as I analyze my surroundings.</p>

<p>Before me lies a steaming blue spring with concentric rings of green, yellow and dark red. I turn around to see another pool. But the rising fog is so dense, I can only guess at the existence of blue water below. Sometimes I glimpse bubbles boiling from some unknown source. The pools are a small sampling of the 10,000 geothermal features that dot Yellowstoneâ€™s caldera and hint at a mysterious hot spot beneath the crust.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s this alien landscape that makes it surprisingly easy to believe that northwestern Wyoming sits directly above a supervolcano—a behemoth far more powerful than your average volcano, with the capacity to eject more than 240 cubic miles of material.</p>
<p>But why do scientists believe there is a supervolcano hidden below? When I asked Henry Heasler, a park geologist at Yellowstone this question, he waxed philosophical. â€œGood science is nothing more than a progress report,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s what we know at a certain time with the data that we have.â€�</p>
<p>Scientists provided one of the most impressive&nbsp;progress reports yet:&nbsp;They peered deep beneath the Earthâ€™s surface and created the first three-dimensional image of the supervolcanoâ€™s plumbing. Although they had already imaged a plume, which brings molten rock up from deep below the mantle to a region about 60 kilometers below the surface, and a magma chamber about 10 kilometers below the surface, the new work had found the missing link between the two.</p>
<p>A second, 11,200-cubic-mile magma chamber connects the plume to the shallower magma chamber. Itâ€™s 4.5 times larger than its shallow companion and has enough hot rock to fill the Grand Canyon nearly 14 times.</p>
<p>Hsin-Hua Huang, a seismologist from the University of Utah and his colleagues used earthquake data to capture this astonishing image. Itâ€™s similar to an ultrasound, said Heasler. â€œWe have the skin of a surface—of a person—but we want to see whatâ€™s inside.â€� When earthquakes travel through dense, hot spots they slow down. So if a seismic wave reaches a sensor later than expected, scientists know thereâ€™s a low-velocity, and hence denser and hotter, region hidden deep within the Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œIf we were just using one pathway—so one earthquake and one seismometer—we couldnâ€™t be able to tell where along that path that low velocity body was. Weâ€™d have no idea,â€� said co-author Jamie Farrell from the University of Utah. Thatâ€™s where multiple earthquakes and sensors come into play. Huangâ€™s team used 4,849 earthquakes, originating from all parts of the earth, plus 80 seismographs across Yellowstone and beyond, to create a rough three-dimensional picture.</p>
<p>Their study was also the first to combine both worldwide and local earthquakes. Distant earthquakes allow scientists to image deep structures (any earthquakes originating under India or China will first travel through the Earthâ€™s core before reaching the U.S.) and local earthquakes allow for shallow structures. Combining the two let the team image the deep magma chamber for the first time. Given that natural earthquakes, however, are relatively rare events—even in one of the most active areas in the world—they had to collect 30 years worth of data.</p>
<p>But seismic tomography isnâ€™t the only way to peer deep underground. GPS satellites can scour the area searching for any ground movement; gravity satellites can look for any changes in the density below; and ground instruments can sample the heat and gases rising from the geothermal features.</p>

<p><span>A</span>ll methods point to a supervolcano thatâ€™s very much alive. From 1976 to 1984, GPS satellite data showed that the caldera floor was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB092iB13p13753/abstract">swelling upwardgravity data</a>. To a satellite orbiting directly above the inflow, the Earth will seem to pull on it a little less than expected. Meanwhile ground instruments measured increasing heat and gases rising from the active features.</p>
<p>Then from 1985 to 1995 the caldera sunk back down about 5.5 inches. Magma was either moving out of the system laterally or the shallow reservoir was simply cooling and contracting, letting gases seep through the surface. Later measurements show that the caldera floor is continuing to swell and sink. But scientists still donâ€™t understand the complex interplay between the supervolcanoâ€™s moving parts.</p>
<p>â€œI think our next step—hopefully—is to be able to look at some smaller scale features of how these bigger features are connected to each other,â€� said Farrell. If scientists can determine how the large magma chambers interact with each other, they will better understand how fluids and heat move the Earth. â€œThen we can start looking at how long it would take for enough material to get from the deep to the shallow [reservoirs] and maybe where we are in the volcanic cycle of eruptions. But weâ€™re not quite there yet.â€�</p>
<p>Although past eruptions dot the Earthâ€™s surface from Oregon to Wyoming, itâ€™s hard to infer anything about a future eruption. And Farrell isnâ€™t convinced another super-eruption will happen at all. â€œThe system might be dying,â€� he said. â€œThe Yellowstone hot spot is moving into thicker, colder continental crust. And it takes a lot more energy to burn through that crust than it did the thinner crust that itâ€™s been burning through for the last 17 million years.â€�</p>
<p>But as I watch Yellowstoneâ€™s surface boil over before my very eyes itâ€™s hard to believe that the system deep beneath my feet might one day fade away. And as a geyser before me erupts, shooting steam and water tens of feet into the air, I have to wonder if itâ€™s instead slowly building toward another super-eruption. After all, despite Farrellâ€™s uncertainty, he continued to say: â€œItâ€™s happened in the past, it could happen in the future.â€�</p>

        <p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get C up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal C “runtime” (typically called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0"><code>crt0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>Compared to other popular programming languages, which require substantial
runtime machinery to operate (e.g: Java’s virtual machine, Go’s garbage
collector, etc…), C’s extremely minimal approach to language design has
allowed it to run on just about any platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while C is effectively dependency free at the <em>language</em> level,
the same can’t be said about its <em>standard library</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the original title of this post was “C Is Not Dependency Free”. This
title didn’t reflect the actual message I was trying to convey (namely, that
it can be tricky for beginners getting started with freestanding C to know
which methods they can and can’t use), and was disingenuous at best, and
actively misleading at worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep things simple, I’ll be focusing exclusively on C, though it should be
noted that everything here applies to C++ as well. While not a strict superset
of C, C++ inherits most of C’s language design and standard library, making it
equally susceptible to the issues outlined below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owing to its strong UNIX heritage, the C standard library includes many
functions and features which assume the existence of some sort of underlying OS.
For example, even the humble and ubiquitous <code>printf</code> function relies on the
existence of the <code>write</code> syscall, the idea of file descriptors, the <code>stdout</code>
stream, etc…</p>
<p>When writing bare-metal C code, beginners often absent-mindedly
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> in an effort to do some quick-and-dirty <code>printf</code> debugging.
Unfortunately, while it might appear as though everything is working fine when
compiling individual translation units, things will inevitably come crashing
down at link time. Raise your hand if you’ve ever been hit with a linker error
that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-writer.o): In function `_write_r':
    writer.c:(.text._write_r+0x20): undefined reference to `_write'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-readr.o): In function `_read_r':
    readr.c:(.text._read_r+0x24): undefined reference to `_read'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-exit.o): In function `exit':
    exit.c:(.text.exit+0x2c): undefined reference to `_exit'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-isattyr.o): In function `_isatty_r':
    isattyr.c:(.text._isatty_r+0x18): undefined reference to `_isatty'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-sbrkr.o): In function `_sbrk_r':
    sbrkr.c:(.text._sbrk_r+0x14): undefined reference to `_sbrk'

gcc: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre><p>Oops! Turns out those <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> methods rely on the existence of some
underlying syscalls, but because this is bare-metal code, they’re nowhere to be
found!</p>
<p>But wait, what about
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17692428/what-is-ffreestanding-option-in-gcc"><code>-ffreestanding</code></a>?
Unfortunately, it doesn’t actually mitigate the problem much. Sure, the compiler
won’t use its built-in versions of common standard library routines, but it
won’t stop you from writing <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and trying to use them anyways!</p>
<p>Now, this certainly isn’t the end of the world. It’s entirely possible to
appease the linker by stubbing out
<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Porting_Newlib#newlib.2Flibc.2Fsys.2Fmyos.2Fsyscalls.c">these syscalls</a>
with some sort of panicking implementation, and working backwards from a crash
to determine which standard library method can’t be used. If you’re lucky, your
toolchain might even include some
<a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/tools-software/tools/f/arm-compilers-forum/44223/what-are-the-compile-option-differences-between---specs-nosys-specs-and---specs-rdimon-specs-in-arm-none-eabi-gcc">built-in</a>
syscall stubs.</p>
<p>In this particular case, it’s pretty obvious why the <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> functions
wouldn’t work when writing bare-metal software. Unfortunately, things aren’t
always so simple.</p>
<p>For example, consider this (admittedly contrived) <code>greet</code> function that only
calls <code>malloc</code> if the input buffer is too small to fit the resulting
string:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;string.h&gt;</span><span>

    <span>const</span> size_t greeting_len <span>=</span> strlen(greeting);
    <span>const</span> size_t name_len <span>=</span> strlen(name);

    <span>const</span> size_t final_size <span>=</span> name_len <span>+</span> greeting_len <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;

</span><span></span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s entirely possible that the code will work 99% of the time, but occasionally
fail in the rare case when the buffer is too small, and <code>malloc</code> ends up getting
called. <code>malloc</code> typically relies on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sbrk"><code>sbrk</code></a> syscall, which in this case, would
be stubbed out. Depending on how <code>sbrk</code> was stubbed out, The program might crash
with an <code>unimplemented syscall</code> error, or <code>malloc</code> might return a null pointer,
which this code (naively) doesn’t check for (after all, when was the last time
<code>malloc</code> failed on your work PC? /s).</p>
<p>One classic workaround for these sorts of footguns is to forgo the C standard
library entirely, and rewrite every method from scratch. After all, how hard can
it be to
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17591624/understanding-the-source-code-of-memcpy">implement <code>memcpy</code></a>
anyway? And sure, this approach might work fine for the simpler methods, but do
you <em>really</em> want to re-implement something like <code>sprintf</code> yourself? Probably
not.</p>
<p>Things get even hairier when using external C libraries. While many C libraries
proudly market themselves as “dependency-free”, they quite often implicitly mean
that they are <em>external</em> dependency-free, and still rely on the C standard
library internally. That’s not to say that there aren’t any <em>truly</em> dependency
free C libraries as well, there most certainly are. Unfortunately, for a
beginner systems programmer, the distinction between being “external” dependency
free and “truly” dependency free may not always be so obvious.</p>
<p>And so, it’s often the case the C programmers are left with one of two options:
use the standard library and be <em>very careful</em> not to use any methods with
hidden syscall dependencies, or forgo the standard library entirely and re-write
any bits of functionality they require themselves. Neither one of these options
is particularly “ergonomic”, and are far from beginner friendly.</p>
<p>If only the C standard library had a clear “line” between all the
platform-agnostic, dependency free bits of code, and all the platform-specific,
“requires an OS” bits of code…</p>

<p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get Rust up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal Rust “runtime” (cheekily called
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/r0"><code>r0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Just like C, this extremely minimal approach to language design allows Rust to
run on just about any platform (well, assuming there’s
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compiler support</a>
for it).</p>
<p>Where Rust differs from C is with respect to its standard library. Learning from
the mistakes of C, the Rust language team made the excellent decision to split
the standard library into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html"><code>std</code></a>: The full-fledged Rust
standard library, “[offering] core types, like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>,
library-defined operations on language primitives, standard macros, I/O and
multithreading, among many other things.”</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/"><code>core</code></a>: The small <em>dependency-free</em>
foundation of Rust language. <code>core</code> “isn’t even aware of heap allocation,
nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require platform
integration, and [the <code>core</code>] library is platform-agnostic.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This seemingly innocuous implementation detail turns out to be absolutely
<em>incredible</em> for bare-metal programmers, as it makes it possible to entirely
“opt-out” of all the OS-dependent bits of the standard library. By relying on
the <code>core</code> library directly, it’s possible to write truly portable bare-metal
code free of any and all “hidden” syscalls!</p>
<p>Unlike C, which allows separate item declarations and implementations (e.g:
declaring a method in a <code>.h</code> header file, and implementing it in a <code>.c</code> file),
Rust requires that items are implemented at the same time as they are declared,
making it <em>impossible</em> to get a linker error when writing typical Rust
code.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>So, how does a “crate” (Rust lingo for library/binary) opt out of the <code>std</code>
standard library? Why, using the handy-dandy top-level <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute!</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute signals to the Rust compiler
that the crate shouldn’t link directly with <code>std</code>, and that it should instead
link with the <code>core</code> library directly.</p>
<p><del><code>#![no_std]</code> is also transitive down the dependency graph, so accidentally
including a dependency that relies on <code>std</code> within a <code>no_std</code> project will be
rejected by the compiler</del><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. This transitive properly makes
it possible to use <code>cargo</code> (Rust’s built-in package manager) to integrate
external dependencies from <code>crate.io</code>, and be confident that if it compiles, it
won’t inadvertently panic at runtime due to a stubbed out “hidden” syscall
dependency. With Rust, using external dependencies with bare-metal code is not
only possible, but thanks to <code>cargo</code>’s best-in-class dependency management
story, it’s incredibly ergonomic as well!</p>
<p>To really show you the power of <code>no_std</code>, lets revisit the <code>greet</code> function from
the last section. Consider the following Rust implementation, which goes out of
it’s way to be as <code>unsafe</code> and un-idiomatic as possible. This could very well be
a “first pass” implementation from a C programmer just getting their feet wet
with Rust:</p>

<p>If you need to bring a lot of data into your app, a data pipeline can help. This article describes how to build a simple data pipeline with Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq, Redis, and Postgres.</p>



<h2>What’s a data pipeline?</h2>



<p>A data pipeline takes information from one place and puts it somewhere else. It likely transforms that data along the way. In enterprise circles, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>, or extract-transform-load.</p>



<p>Generally, data pipelines:</p>



<ol><li>Ingest a lot of data at once</li><li>Ingest new or updated data on a schedule</li></ol>



<h2>Splitting data into small jobs</h2>



<p>A reliable pipeline starts big and reduces data into small slices that can be independently processed. Bigger jobs “fan out” into small ones. The smallest jobs, handling one record each, do most of the work.</p>



<p>Breaking work into smaller jobs helps handle failure. If the pipeline ingests 1,000,000 records, chances are that a few of them are invalid. If those invalid records are processing in their own jobs, then then they can fail without impacting other records. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.lobbyfocus.com/">Lobby Focus</a>, a project of mine, ingests <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm">United States lobbying data from the U.S. Senate</a>. There are about 1,000,000 lobbying records from 2010-2020. Processing them all in a single job would be risky, as the entire job would fail if even one record triggered an error. Instead, Lobby Focus breaks down data into small slices and ends up processing each record in its own job. To bring in 1,000,000 lobbying records, it takes 1,001,041 jobs.</p>



<p>Pipelines can handle a ton of jobs with ease. Splitting up work into many small jobs offers advantages:</p>



<ol><li>Most jobs deal with only one record. If a job fails, it’s easy to pin down the problematic record, fix it, and retry it. The rest of the pipeline continues uninterrupted.</li><li>The pipeline can ingest data in parallel, with many small jobs running at once. </li><li>It’s easy to track progress by looking at how many jobs succeeded and how many remain.</li></ol>



<h2>A Ruby on Rails pipeline stack</h2>



<p>This stack, used in the example below, makes for a solid data pipeline:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></strong> interfaces with all the pieces below and has a strong ecosystem of libraries.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a></strong> manages data pipeline jobs, providing visibility into progress and errors.</li><li><strong><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a></strong> backs Sidekiq and stores the job queue.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a></strong> stores intermediate and final data.</li><li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></strong> serves as a staging area for source data.</li></ul>



<p>Managed platforms like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://www.cloud66.com/">Cloud 66</a> are good hosting options for this stack.</p>



<h2>Real-world example: U.S. Senate lobbying data</h2>



<p><a href="https://lobbyfocus.com/">Lobby Focus</a> ingests lobbying data from the U.S. Senate and makes it accessible to users. Here’s a peek into its data pipeline, which breaks data into small jobs and uses the stack above.</p>



<h3>Step 1: Scrape</h3>



<p><strong>1 Sidekiq job</strong> deals with <strong>1,000,000 records</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> None</p>



<ul><li>Gathers a list of ZIP files from the U.S. Senate, using <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty">HTTParty</a> to retrieve the webpage and <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri">Nokogiri</a> to parse it</li><li>Launches a download job for each ZIP file. To ingest lobbying data from 2010 to 2020, it will launch 40 <strong>download</strong> jobs for 40 ZIP’s.</li></ul>



<h3>Step 2: Download</h3>



<p><strong>40 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>25,000 records</strong> <strong>each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> ZIP file URL</p>



<ul><li>Checks the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified">last-modified</a> header to see if the current version was already processed. If so, aborts the job.</li><li>Downloads the ZIP and unzips its contents into Amazon S3, using <a href="https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip">rubyzip</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby">aws-s3-sdk</a>.</li><li>Launches a <strong>process</strong> job for each XML file in the ZIP. </li></ul>



<h3>Step 3: Process</h3>



<p><strong>1,000 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>1,000 records each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> XML file URL (S3)</p>



<ul><li>Parses the XML with <a href="https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html">Nokogiri</a></li><li>Adds the content of each record in the XML file to Postgres, as a raw XML string. </li><li>Launches a <strong>load</strong> job for each record in the XML file, passing the Postgres record ID. </li></ul>



<p>Postgres can bear a high volume of record inserts. The pipeline uses it as an intermediate data store. The next job, <strong>load</strong>, receives the Postgres record ID and accesses it to get the XML string. Using Postgres to pass the XML avoids passing giant parameters between jobs. Sidekiq <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">recommends small job parameters</a> to keep the queue lean and preserve Redis memory.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Load</h3>



<p><strong>1,000,000 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>1 record each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> Postgres record ID</p>



<ul><li>Retrieves the XML string from Postgres and parses it with <a href="https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html">Nokogiri</a></li><li>Validates data and aborts the job with an error if there is an issue</li><li>Upserts final data record into Postgres</li></ul>



<h2>Staying resilient</h2>



<p>Breaking out data loads into small jobs is key to a resilient pipeline. Here are some more tips:</p>



<h3>Make jobs idempotent</h3>



<p>Any job should be able to run twice without duplicating data. In other words, jobs should be idempotent.</p>



<p>Look for a unique key in the source data and use it to avoid writing duplicate data. </p>



<p>For instance, you can set a Postgres unique index on the key. Then,  use Rails’ <a href="https://blog.bigbinary.com/2019/03/25/rails-6-adds-create_or_find_by.html">create_or_find_by</a> method to create or update a record, depending on whether the key already exists.</p>



<h3>Use constraints to reject invalid data</h3>



<p>Set constraints to stop invalid data from coming in. If a field should always have a value, use a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/ddl-constraints.html">Postgres constraint</a> to require that field. Use Ruby’s strict <a href="https://avdi.codes/a-ruby-conversion-idiom/">conversion methods</a> to throw an error and abort a job if you’re expecting one data type (say, an integer like 3) but get another (say, a string like “n/a”).</p>



<p>Data is never perfect. If you catch invalid data errors early, you can adjust your pipeline to handle unexpected values.</p>



<h2>What to read next</h2>



<p>A job management library like Sidekiq is critical to a data pipeline. Read more about <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, the backbone of this example. Its <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">best practices docs</a> are small and useful. If you’re not using Ruby, find the top job management libraries for your language.</p>



<p>To practice creating a pipeline, find a public dataset that interests you and build a pipeline for it. The United States Government, for instance, lists its open government data on <a href="https://data.gov/">data.gov</a>. Datasets range from <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare">physician comparison data</a> and a <a href="https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/ords/f?p=105:19:7020640354040::NO:::">database of every dam in the U.S</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, check out managed solutions like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Dataflow</a> for particularly large pipelines.</p>

<p><code>offchain::ipfs</code> is <a href="https://substrate.io/">Substrate</a>, infused with <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Substrate</strong> is a blockchain framework built in Rust, with off-chain worker capabilities.
<br><strong>IPFS</strong> is a distributed file storage network, connecting peers and their content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By including <a href="https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ifps">the Rust implementation IPFS</a> in the native
Substrate runtime, and by allowing pass-through wasm calls via Substrate's
<a href="https://www.substrate.io/kb/learn-substrate/off-chain-workers">Off-chain Workers</a>, we enable a powerful and familiar subset of the IPFS APIs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ipfs add</code> - Write data to IPFS</li>
<li><code>ipfs cat</code> - Read data from IPFS</li>
<li><code>ipfs dht findpeer</code> - Discover peers</li>
<li><code>ipfs dht findprovs</code> - Discover content</li>
<li><code>ipfs swarm connect</code> / <code>disconnect</code> - Swarm with other IPFS peers</li>
<li><code>ipfs pin add</code> / <code>rm</code> - Pin and unpin content</li>
</ul>
<p><code>offchain::ipfs</code> allows you to account for your data transactions and DHT status in the blockchain.
These on-chain insights can serve as a foundation for incentivized data storage and replication.
This means <em>no separate executable</em>: both blockchain and distributed storage are together in one.</p>
<p>The <code>offchain::ipfs</code> Manual is the documentation of our efforts, as well as useful explanations
and code examples to get you started using this technology. Due to <code>offchain::ipfs</code> being a
well-maintained fork of <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate">paritytech/substrate</a>, this manual also stands in as typical
documentation, such as docs.rs and README.md files.</p>
<p>This manual is presented by: <a href="https://github.com/koivunej">@koivunej</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ljedrz">@ljedrz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/whalelephant">@whalelephant</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/aphelionz">@aphelionz</a></p>
<h2><a href="#disclaimers" id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</a></h2>
<p>You should still consider this an <strong>alpha preview</strong>.</p>
<p>The primary value of this work is the embedded IPFS node itself. The pallet included in the
<code>node-template</code> binary is only meant as a showcase, and is just one of many possible realizations
of <code>offchain::ipfs</code>.</p>

<p>You’ve installed PostgreSQL. Now what? I assume you’ve been given a task that 
uses <code>psql</code> and you want to learn the absolute minimum to
get the job done.</p>

<p>This is both a brief tutorial and a 
quick reference for the absolute least you need to know about <code>psql</code>. 
I assume you’re familiar with the command line and have a rough idea about
what database administration tasks, but aren’t familiar with how to
use <code>psql</code> to do the basics.</p>

<p>View on <a href="https://tomcam.github.io/postgres/">GitHub Pages</a> or directly on <a href="https://github.com/tomcam/postgres/">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/">PostgreSQL documentation</a> is incredibly 
well written and thorough, but frankly, I didn’t know where to start reading. This
is my answer to that problem.</p>

<p>If you have any complaints or suggestions please let me know by 
sending your feedback to tomcampbell@gmail.com.</p>

<p>It shows how to do the following at the <code>psql</code> prompt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#opening-a-connection-locally">Start and quit <code>psql</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="#h-help">Get help</a></li>
  <li><a href="#getting-information-about-databases">Get information about databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-database">Create databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-table-create-table">CREATE TABLEs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#adding-a-record-insert-into">INSERT, or add records to a table</a></li>
  <li><a href="#select">SELECT, to do simple queries</a></li>
  <li><a href="#reference">Reference</a> pointing to the official PostgreSQL documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have access to a live PostgreSQL installation at the moment we still have your back.
You can follow through the examples and the output is shown as if you
did type everything out.</p>

<h2 id="the-psql-command-line-utility">The psql command line utility</h2>

<p>Many administrative tasks can or should be done on your local machine, 
even though if database lives on the cloud.
You can do some of them through a visual user interface, but that’s not covered here. 
Knowing how to perform these operations on the command line means you can script them,
and scripting means you can automate tests, check errors, and do data entry on the command line.</p>

<p>This section isn’t a full cheat sheet for <code>psql</code>.
It covers the most common operations and shows them roughly in sequence, 
as you’d use them in a typical work session.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>

<p>Before using this section, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user name and password for your PostgreSQL database</li>
  <li>The IP address of your remote instance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="command-line-prompts-on-the-operating-system">Command-line prompts on the operating system</h3>

<p>The <code>$</code> starting a command line in the examples below represents your operating system prompt. 
Prompts are configurable so it may well not look like this. 
On Windows it might look like <code>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL&gt;</code> but Windows prompts are also configurable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ psql -U sampleuser -h localhost
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A line starting with <code>#</code> represents a comment. Same for everything to the right of a <code>#</code>. 
If you accidentally type it or copy and paste it in, don’t worry. Nothing will happen.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>This worked to connect to Postgres on DigitalOcean
<span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>
<span># -p is the port where the database listens to connections. Default is 5432.</span>
<span># -d is the name of the database to connect to. I think DO generated this for me, or maybe PostgreSQL.</span>
<span># Password when asked is csizllepewdypieiib</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> doadmin <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 25060 <span>-d</span> mydb

<span># Open a database in a remote location.</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> sampleuser <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 21334
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="using-psql">Using psql</h2>

<p>You’ll use <code>psql</code> (aka the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">PostgreSQL interactive terminal</a>) most of all because it’s used to create databases and tables, show information about tables, and even to enter information (records) into the database.</p>

<h3 id="quitting-pqsql">Quitting pqsql</h3>

<p>Before we learn anything else, here’s how to quit <code>psql</code> and return to the operating system prompt.
You type backslash, the letter <code>q</code>, and then you press the Enter or return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Press enter after typing \q
# Remember this is backslash, not forward slash
postgres=# \q
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes you back out to the operating system prompt.</p>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-locally">Opening a connection locally</h3>

<p>A common case during development is opening a connection to a local database (one on your own machine).
Run <code>psql</code> with <code>-U</code> (for user name) followed by the name of the database, <code>postgres</code> in this example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># Log into Postgres as the user named postgres
$ psql -U postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-remotely">Opening a connection remotely</h3>

<p>To connect your remote PostgreSQL instance from your local machine, use <code>psql</code> at your operating system command line.
Here’s a typical connection.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>
<span># -p is the port where the database listens to connections. Default is 5432.</span>
<span># -d is the name of the database to connect to. I think DO generated this for me, or maybe PostgreSQL.</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> doadmin <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 25060 <span>-d</span> defaultdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you’d enter the password. In case someone is peering over your shoulder, the characters are hidden. After you’ve entered your information properly you’ll get this message (truncated for clarity):</p>

<h3 id="looking-at-the-psql-prompt">Looking at the psql prompt</h3>
<p>A few things appear, then the <code>psql</code> prompt is displayed.
The name of the current database appears before the prompt.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>psql (11.1, server 11.0)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point you’re expected to type commands and parameters into the command line.</p>

<h3 id="psql-vs-sql-commands">psql vs SQL commands</h3>

<p><code>psql</code> has two different kinds of commands. Those starting with a backslash
are for <code>psql</code> itself, as illustrated by the use of <code>\q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>Those starting with valid SQL are of course interactive SQL used to
create and modify PostgreSQL databases.</p>

<h3 id="warning-sql-commands-end-with-a-semicolon">Warning: SQL commands end with a semicolon!</h3>

<p>One gotcha is that almost all SQL commands you enter into <code>psql</code> must end in a semicolon.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example,suppose you want to remove a table named <code>sample_property_5</code>. You’d enter this command:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easy to forget. If you do forget the semicolon, you’ll see this perplexing prompt.
Note that a <code>[</code> has been inserted before the username portion of the prompt, and another
prompt appears below it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=#

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you do, just remember to finish it off with that semicolon:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=# ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="scrolling-through-the-command-history">Scrolling through the command history</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the up and down arrow keys to move backwards and forwards through the command history.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-information-about-databases">Getting information about databases</h2>

<p>These aren’t SQL commands so just press Enter after them. Remember that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When there’s more output than fits the screen, it pauses. Press space to continue</li>
  <li>If you want to halt the output, press <code>q</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-help">\h Help</h3>

<div><div><pre><code># Get help. Note it's a backslash, not a forward slash.
postgres=# \h
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You’ll get a long list of commands, then output is paused:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Available help:
  ABORT                            CREATE USER
  ...
  ALTER AGGREGATE                  CREATE USER MAPPING
  ALTER PROCEDURE                  DROP INDEX
:
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Press space to continue, or <code>q</code> to stop the output.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get help on a particular item by listing it after the <code>\h</code> command.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to get help on <code>DROP TABLE</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \h drop table
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll get help on just tha item:</p>

<pre><code>Command:     DROP TABLE
Description: remove a table
Syntax:
DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="l-list-databases">\l List databases</h3>

<p>What most people think of as a database (say, a list of customers) is actually a table. A database is a set of tables, information about those tables, information about users and their permissions, and much more. Some of these databases (and the tables within) are updated automatically by PostgreSQL as you use them.</p>

<p>To get a list of all databases:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 visitor   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 markets   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 tom       | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 

</code></pre>

<p>You can get info on a single database by following the <code>\l</code> prompt with its name.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to view information about the <code>template0</code> database:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l template0
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
</code></pre>

<h3 id="l-list-databases-with-size-tablespace-and-description">\l+ List databases with size, tablespace, and description</h3>

<p>To get additional information on the space consumed by database tables
and comments describing those tables, use <code>\l+</code>:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l+
</code></pre>

<h3 id="x-expandnarrow-table-lists">\x Expand/narrow table lists</h3>

<p>Use <code>\x</code> (X for eXpanded listing) to control 
whether table listings use a wide or narrow format.</p>

choose where to live independently of where they work and save a lot of time and
money on sometimes long commutes (which is also great for the climate â€“ with all
the focus currently being on Covid 19 we must not forget about the real
existential crisis humanity is facing after all). Companies also benefit as they
can attract the best talent from anywhere and are not limited in terms of who
they can hire by their location.</p>
<p>Yet, even as employees and companies alike are eager to adopt remote work and in
theory all the required infrastructure and tools are available, it is still not
easy to get right. Many teams and companies are struggling to go remote and
yearn for the return of the days of the office. The reality is those days are
not going to come back in many industries though and making remote work a
success is going to be one of the key challenges many companies will be facing
in the coming years.</p>
<p>We have run simplabs as a remote company since the beginning. In the early days,
we faced many of the same challenges other teams are struggling with now. Over
time, we overcame each one, and learned a lot along the way. Today, we have team
members in six countries across Europe with people working from co-working
offices in Berlin, kitchens in Augsburg, sheds in Dublin, or even from a
sailboat in Portugal. And we're not the only ones enjoying the many advantages
of working remotely â€“ 90% of remote workers say they plan to remain remote for
the rest of their careers and 94% would even encourage others to work remotely
as well according to
<a href="https://buffer.com/resources/state-remote-work-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study by Buffer</a> that
was conducted in 2018.</p>
<h2 id="a-remote-culture">A remote culture</h2>
<p>Adopting a remote working model does not necessarily have to mean for everyone
to go remote immediately. It can of course be adopted completely and for
everyone but also partially or incrementally as an option only while still
keeping the office for everyone who likes to continue working from it. However,
it is an allâ€“orâ€“nothing kind of change in terms of working culture regardless of
how many team members will actually be working remotely. Remote work requires
fundamentally different practices when it comes to collaboration and management
and a lot of attention to aspects that are less relevant when the entire team
works from the same location.</p>
<p>Possibly the single most important of these aspects is transparency and the flow
and sharing of information. While diagrams, concepts, or calendars pinned to the
wall (or the sticky-notes sprint board that has turned into a status symbol for
teams that "do agile" in the past years) are reasonable and probably good tools
for sharing information among people that all work from the same location, in a
remote environment, these practices don't work. All information shared in such
ways will be completely invisible for everyone who is not in the office,
excluding remote team members from participating in decision-making processes
and preventing them from effectively contributing to the common goal.</p>
<figure><img alt="Burn down your sticky notes walls" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@1000-79f1f215bf9f7d20d95247c1363bcd23.jpg 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@2000-224accf0036ced2f3423fcb4d8bc2ccc.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>While direct communication in the office is not something anyone should
prohibit, all the information and decisions that are made in any conversations
must be made transparent to the entire team. Writing summaries and protocols of
face-to-face conversations or communicating via a chat tool although sitting at
the desk next to the person one is having a conversation with feels strange in
the beginning. It is however a necessary prerequisite for making remote work
work at all and failing to do it properly will alienate remote teammates. In
that way, the pandemic that forced teams to go fully remote all at once at the
same time might even have made the transition easier rather than harder for them
because everyone was in the same position and shared the same perspective.</p>
<h3 id="cultivating-trust">Cultivating Trust</h3>
<p>Another very important cultural aspect to consider when a team goes fully or
partly remote is trust. Many managers' first reaction, when faced with their
teams working remotely, is asking</p>
<p><em>"How can I know my team actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"</em></p>
<p>Just because managers cannot <strong>see</strong> the work happening does not mean it does
not happen. Managers' desire to micro-manage teams is an equally bad habit
regardless of whether the team is remote or not â€“ yet, remote teams seem to
increase that desire, often resulting in managers being on everyone's back
constantly and consistently even more than with all of the team working from the
office. However, the occasional check-in for a status update is just as
interruptive remotely as it is in the office.</p>
<figure><img alt="Direct messages are interruptive and keep people from working" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@1000-3d75f68182ec16f78066993a31c4d5d6.png 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@2000-c665229d789cffd7a3165c4c44f77a26.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>The reality is that remote workers are likely more productive rather than less
as they will find it easier to focus and be less stressed according to the
<a href="https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/Owl%20Labs%202019%20State%20of%20Remote%20Work%20Report%20PDF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Remote Work 2019 report by OWLLabs</a>.
Building up that trust and allowing people uninterrupted time to focus while
giving up on micro-management practices is going to be a task for many managers
to learn over the next years.</p>

<p>Working remotely requires adapting a number of infrastructure and tooling. There
are a plethora of great tools available and many companies are even using some
of them already. Which exact tools a team uses is not even so relevant and there
are plenty of options available â€“ mostly those fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>tools for ad-hoc, real-time communication</li>
<li>tools for knowledge management and sharing</li>
<li>tools for organizing work and communicating status</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is important to have tools for all of these use cases, it is equally
important to keep the total number of tools in use to a minimum to prevent
chaos. There is always going to be the new hip tool that everyone wants to try
and doing so often silently makes that new tool part of the de-facto toolset a
team uses, growing that little by little over time. Eventually, teams then end
up with entire landscapes of tools, where nobody knows what kind of information
goes where and although each tool is perfectly good in isolation, in combination
they cause more confusion than they support the team.</p>

<p>Team chat tools like Slack (or Microsoft Teams for the more classic companies)
have seen widespread adoption over the past years and there are only a few
companies that don't use any of those at this point. They have developed into
the backbone for remote work for many teams. While in an office environment,
sending someone or a group of people a chat message saves you having to walk
over to a separate room or building, in a remote environment it is the <strong>only</strong>
way to reach out to someone directly (unless you call the person but who does
phone calls anymore?). What's easy to forget is how interruptive these tools can
be. Sending someone a chat message always implies urgency. Even if we all know
the majority of chat messages we get are in fact not urgent, it's hard to ignore
someone who just starts talking (writing) to you.</p>
<p>While most remote workers experience it is easier to focus, a liberal
communication style on team chat can demolish a lot of that increased focus
again. For effective communication, it is important to be respectful of other
people's time and need to focus on their work. Not everything is urgent all of
the time and justifies notifying a coworker or even a group of people. The fact
that you feel like you need something now doesn't necessarily mean someone else
should stop what they are currently doing to answer you. In many cases, sending
a good old email that is going to be less intrusive and more respectful of the
recipient's time is the better communication option compared to sending the
person a message on team chat asking for something that could totally wait until
tomorrow as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to keep people in the loop and ensure
transparency of communication when using any kind of communication tool.
Communication that happens via direct messages between two people is invisible
to everyone else, while it might actually be relevant to others as well. As a
rule of thumb, we recommend keeping everything in public channels unless the
topic is strictly confidential or private in nature.</p>
<p>Although the information in public channels will be accessible to everyone, it
is important to understand any real-time communication tool is essentially
ephemeral in nature. While that is not technically correct and most tools do in
fact store all communication indefinitely, even with built-in search
functionality it is practically impossible to find a piece of information you
are looking for that was discussed for example in some Slack channel (you likely
don't even remember which one) the day before. So while team chat is a good
mechanism to communicate among the team in a low effort, informal way, any
information or decisions that are made via it need to eventually make their way
into other, more permanent, and organized systems.</p>
<h4 id="video-conferencing">Video Conferencing</h4>
<p>Besides text-based communication systems, of course, video conferences play a
major role in remote work as well. That way of communication has seen a huge
boost in adoption during the pandemic with everyone isolating at home and many
people using video calls for the first time even (I'm sure everyone had their
<em>"Dad, the camera is pointing on the floor"</em> moments). While late adopters
expectedly struggled with the technology, many remote teams experience similar
problems during their daily work lives. Poor audio or video quality, dogs
barking in the background, calls starting 10min late until everyone has figured
out their setup, etc. are common problems for many teams and have a severe
negative effect on meeting efficiency.</p>
<p>All these problems are easy to prevent when following a number of simple
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>There needs to be proper audio and video hardware in place. For two or more
people joining a call together that means a proper conference speaker that
ensures people on the other end will be able to hear everyone in the room even
if more than one person …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Terrains are at the heart of every Computer Game - be it Counter-Strike, Age of Empires, or even Minecraft. The virtual world that these games generate is the key to a great gaming experience. Generating terrain, manually, requires a ton of effort and hence it makes sense to auto-generate a pseudorandom terrain using some procedure. In this essay, we take a detailed look into generating pseudorandom one-dimensional terrain that is very close to real ones.</p>

<p>A one-dimensional terrain is a bunch of heights defined at every point along the X-axis. An example of this could be seen in games like Flappy Bird, Galaxy, and many more. Such terrain could also be traced as the skylines of mountain ranges.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows a one-dimensional terrain and is taken as a sketch of a distant mountain range. The procedure we define should generate terrains as close to natural ones as possible.</p>

<p>A naive solution to generate a random terrain is by using the <code>random</code> function for each point along the X-axis. The <code>random</code> function yields random values in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>, and we map these values to the required height, for example <code>[0, 100]</code>.  The 1D terrain generation algorithm using the default random function is thus defined as</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>mapv</span><span>(v, ol, oh, nl, nh)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""maps the value `v` from old range [ol, oh] to new range [nl, nh]
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> nl + (v * ((nh - nl) / (oh - ol)))

<span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_naive</span><span>(count)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""returns the list of integers representing height at each point.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> [
        mapv(random.random(), <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>100</span>)
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(count)
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mapv</code> function defined above comes in very handy as it helps us to map value from a source range to a target range. The terrain generation function <code>terrain_naive</code> takes in <code>count</code> as input, suggesting the number of points along the X-axis, and it returns a list of float values representing height at each of the <code>count</code> number of points along the terrain.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png"></p>
<p>The above illustration shows the plot of the one-dimensional terrain using the above <code>terrain_naive</code> function. The terrain generated using this procedure has a lot of spikes and abrupt changes in height and it clearly does not mimic the terrains in the real world. Real-world terrains, although random, does not have a lot of sharp spikes, instead, the changes in height are very gradual and ensure some degree of smoothness.</p>
<p>In order to bring smoothness to <code>terrain_naive</code> generated terrains, we take a look at a famous estimation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolation</a> which estimates intermediate values given a bunch of known points.</p>

<p>Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within a range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation methods estimate the intermediate data points ensuring a "smoothened" transition from one known point to another. There are several interpolation methods but we restrict our focus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">Linear</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation">Cosine</a> interpolation methods.</p>
<h3>Linear Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation estimates the intermediate points between the known points assuming collinearity. Thus given two known points <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, using linear interpolation, we estimate an intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from <code>a</code> using the function defined below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>linp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu) + b * mu
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the parameter <code>mu</code> ranges in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code> where <code>0</code> implies the point being estimated and interpolated is at <code>a</code> while <code>1</code> implies it is at the second point <code>b</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png"></p>
<h3>Cosine Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation is not always desirable as the plot sees a lot of discontinuous and sharp transitions. When the plot is expected to be smoother, it is where the Cosine Interpolation comes in handy. Instead of assuming intermediate points are collinear with the known ones, Cosine Interpolation, plots them on a cosine curve passing through the known points, providing a much smoother transition. This is could be seen in the illustration above.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> math

<span><span>def</span> <span>cosp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    mu2 = (<span>1</span> - math.cos(mu * math.pi)) / <span>2</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu2) + b * mu2
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet computes and estimates intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from the first point <code>a</code> using Cosine Interpolation. Note there are other interpolation methods, but we can solve all major of our use cases using these two.</p>

<p>We can apply interpolation to our naively generated terrain and make transitions smoother leading to fewer spikes. In the real-world, the transitions in the terrain are gradual with peaks being widespread; we can mimic the pattern by sampling <code>k</code> points from the naive terrain which could become our desired peaks, and interpolate the rest of the points lying between them.</p>
<p>This should ideally help us reduce the sudden spikes and make the terrain look much closer to really like. A simple python code that outputs linearly interpolated terrain that samples every <code>sample</code> points from the naive one is as follows</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, sample=<span>4</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated terrain on sample data.
    """</span>
    terrain = []

    
    sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]

    
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

        
        terrain.append(sample_points[i])

        
        
        <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
            
            mu = (j + <span>1</span>)/sample
          
            
            a = sample_points[i]
            b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
            v = linp(a, b, mu)

            

    
    <span>return</span> terrain
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet generates intermediate points using Linear Interpolation but we can very easily change the interpolation function to Cosine Interpolation and see the effect in action. The sampling and interpolating on a naively generated terrain for different values of sample is as shown below</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png"></p>
<p>For each interpolation, the 5 plots shown above are sampled for every <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> points respectively. We can clearly see the plots of Cosine Interpolation are much smoother than Linear Interpolated ones. The technique does a good job over naive implementation but it still does not mimic what we see in the real world. To make things as close to the real-world as possible we use the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle">Superposition</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling and Interpolation are effective in reducing the spikes and making transitions gradual. The concern with this approach is that sudden changes are not really gone. In order to address this situation, we use the principle of Superposition upon multiple such sampled terrains.</p>
<p>The approach we take here is to generate <code>k</code> such terrains with different sampling frequencies and then perform a normalized weighted sum. This way we get the best of both worlds i.e smoothness from the terrain with the least sampled points and aberrations from the one with the most sampled points.</p>
<p>Now the only piece that remains is choosing the weights. The weights and sampling frequency varies by the power of <code>2</code>. The number of terrains to be sampled depends on the kind of terrain needed and is to be left for experimentation, but we can assume it to be 6 for most use cases.</p>
<p>The terrain that samples all the points should be given the least weight as it aims to contribute sudden spikes; and as we increase the sampling frequency by the power of <code>2</code> we increase the weight by the power of <code>2</code> as well. Hence for the first terrain, the scale is <code>0.03125</code> where were sample all the points <code>256</code>, the next terrain is sampled with <code>128</code> points and has a scale of <code>0.0625</code>, and so on till we reach sampled points to be <code>8</code> with scale as <code>1</code>, giving it the highest weight.</p>
<p>Once these terrains are generated we perform a normalized weighted sum and generate the final terrain as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows 6 scaled sampled terrains with different sampling frequencies along with the final super-positioned terrain generated from the procedure. It is very clear that the terrain generated using this procedure is much more closer to the real world terrain than any other we have seen before. Python code that generated the above terrain is as below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_superpos_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, iterations=<span>8</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates

        sample = <span>1</span> &lt;&lt; (iterations - z)

        
        sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]
        
        weight_sum += weight

        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

            
            terrain.append(weight * sample_points[i])

            
            
            <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
                
                mu = (j + <span>1</span>) / sample

                
                a = sample_points[i]
                b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
                v = linp(a, b, mu)

                
                terrain.append(weight * v)

        
        
        terrains.append(terrain)

    
    
    <span>return</span> [sum(x)/weight_sum <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> zip(*terrains)]
</code></pre>
<p>If the terrain to be generated is needed to be smoother then instead of using Linear Interpolation switch to Cosine Interpolation and the resultant terrain will be much smoother and curvier as seen in the illustration below.</p>

    </undefined></p><p>The idea behind this pattern is very simple: <strong>Failures are inevitable, and trying to prevent them altogether is not realistic</strong>. </p><p>A way to handle these failures is by wrapping these operations into some kind of proxy. This proxy is responsible for monitoring recent failures, and using this information to decide whether to allow the operation to proceed or return an early failure instead. </p><p>This proxy is typically implemented as a state machine that mimics the functionality of a physical <strong>circuit breaker</strong> which my have 3 states:</p><ul><li><strong>Closed:</strong> In this state the circuit breaker lets all the requests go through while keeping track of the number of recent failures, and if the number of failures exceeds a specific threshold within a specific time frame, it will switch to the <strong>Open</strong> state.</li><li><strong>Open:</strong> In this state, any requests are not sent to the external service. Instead we either fail immediately returning an extension, or fall back to a secondary system like a cache.  </li><li><strong>Half-Open:</strong> In this state, a limited number of requests from the application are allowed to pass-through and call our external service. Depending on the result of these requests the <strong>circuit breaker</strong> will either flip to a Closed state or go back to the Open state resetting the counter before trying to open again. </li></ul><p>The Circuit Breaker pattern offers a few key advantages worth noting:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Half-Open</strong> state gives the external system time to recover without getting flooded.</li><li>The <strong>Open</strong> state implementation gives options for how we want to handle failure, whether failing right away or falling back to a caching layer or secondary system. </li><li>This pattern can also be leveraged to help to maintain response times by <strong>quickly rejecting calls</strong> that are likely to fail or timeout. </li></ul><h2>Example</h2><p>For our example, let’s imagine that we have the following scenario:</p><blockquote><p>We are running a job board aggregator that will consume job postings from Github and other sources. However, since we are consuming a few different APIs we run the risk that we will hit a request limit or that an API will be down. </p></blockquote><p>Let’s start by creating an example API connector to <strong>Github Jobs</strong> that retrieves the latest 50 jobs posted:</p><div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> CircuitBreaker<span>.</span>Api<span>.</span>GithubJobs <span>do</span>

<p>If you want to learn about state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms (HPO), in this article I’ll tell you what they are and how they work.</p>



<p>As an ML researcher I’ve read about and used state-of-the-art HPO algorithms quite a bit and in the next few sections I’m going to share with you what I’ve discovered so far.</p>



<p>Hope you like it!&nbsp;</p>








<h2 id="Approaches">A bit about HPO approaches</h2>



<p>HPO is a method that helps solve the challenge of tuning hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outstanding ML algorithms have multiple, distinct and complex hyperparameters that generate an enormous search space. Plenty of start-ups choose to use deep learning in the core of their pipelines, and search space in deep learning methods is even larger than traditional ML algorithms.&nbsp;Tuning on a massive search space is a tough challenge.</p>



<p>To solve HPO problems, we need to use data-driven methods. Manual methods are not effective.</p>



<p>Many approaches have been proposed to tackle the HPO problem:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="513" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1024%2C513&amp;ssl=1" alt="HPO" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1024%2C513&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1536%2C770&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automated Machine Learning: State-of-The-Art and Open Challenges</a></em></p>



<p>We will discuss four main, most effective methods.</p>






<h2 id="Bayesian-Optimization">Bayesian Optimization&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To understand BO, we should know a bit about the Grid search and random search methods (explained nicely in <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this paper</a>). I’m just going to summarize these methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say that our search space consists of only two hyperparameters, one is significant and the other is unimportant. We want to tune them to improve the accuracy of the model. If each of them has 3 distinct values, the whole search space would be 9 possible choices. We could try each of them to find the best value for both hyperparameters.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="325" height="352" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/grid-layout.png?resize=325%2C352&amp;ssl=1" alt="grid layout" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/grid-layout.png?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/grid-layout.png?resize=277%2C300&amp;ssl=1 277w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization</a></em></p>



<p>But as you can see in the figure above, Grid search was unable to find the best value for the important hyperparameter. One solution for this may be to go through the search space at random, much like the figure below.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="309" height="360" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/random-layout.png?resize=309%2C360&amp;ssl=1" alt="random layout" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/random-layout.png?w=309&amp;ssl=1 309w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/random-layout.png?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization</a></em></p>






<h3><strong>Why is Bayesian Optimization effective?</strong></h3>



<p>The Random search eventually converges to the optimal answer, but this method is just such a blind search! Is there a smarter way to search? Yes – Bayesian optimization, suggested by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-38527-2_55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">J.Močkus</a>. You can find more information about BO in this <a href="https://static.sigopt.com/b/20a144d208ef255d3b981ce419667ec25d8412e2/static/pdf/SigOpt_Bayesian_Optimization_Primer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bayesian Optimization Primer</a>, and in <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms</a>.</p>



<p>In essence, Bayesian optimization is a probability model that wants to learn an expensive objective function by learning based on previous observation. It has two powerful features: surrogate model, and acquisition function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the figure above, you can see a nice explanation for Bayesian optimization based on the Hyperparameter Optimization chapter in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05318-5_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automated Machine Learning</a>. In this figure, we want to find the true objective function which is shown as a dashed line. Imagine we have one continuous hyperparameter, and in the second iteration we observed two black points, then we fitted a surrogate model (regression model) that is the black line. The blue tube around the black line is our uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also have an acquisition function, which is the way we explore the search space for finding the new observation optimum value. In other words, the acquisition function helps us improve our surrogate model and select the next value. In the image above, the acquisition function is shown as an orange curve. An acquisition max means where the uncertainty is max and predicted value is low.</p>






<h3><strong>Pros and cons of Bayesian Optimization</strong></h3>



<p>The most important advantage for bayesian optimization is that it can operate very well with black box function. BO is also data efficient and robust with noise. But it can’t work well with parallel resources duo, because&nbsp;the optimization process is sequential.</p>

<h2 id="Algorithms">Multi Fidelity Optimization</h2>



<p>In the Bayesian method, estimation of the objective function is very expensive. Is there any cheaper way to estimate the objective function? Multi Fidelity optimization methods are the answer. I’ll tell you about:</p>



<ol><li>Successive halving</li><li>HyperBand</li><li>BOHB</li></ol>



<p>As an extra resource, in the following video Andreas Mueller explained multi fidelity optimization methods very nicely.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqtTHRwa8dE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>

<h2>Successive halving</h2>



<p>Successive halving tries to give the most budget to the most promising methods. It assumes all configuration could be stopped early and validation score could be obtained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine you have N different configurations and ß budget (for example time). In each iteration, as you can see in the below image, successive halving keeps the best halve of the configurations and discards half of the algorithms that are not good. It will continue until we have just one single configuration. This method will be finished when it reaches the maximum of its budget.</p>

<p><em>Figure from <a href="https://www.automl.org/blog-2nd-automl-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">automl.org</a></em></p>



<p>Successive halving was originally proposed in <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/jamieson16.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Non-stochastic Best Arm Identification and Hyperparameter Optimization</a>, written by Kevin Jamieson and&nbsp;Ameet Talwalkar.</p>



<h3><strong>What is the problem with successive halving?</strong></h3>



<p>In successive halving there is a trade-off between how many configurations we need to select at start and how many cuts we need. In the next section you’ll see how Hyperband solves this issue.</p>






<h2>HyperBand&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This method is an extension on top of successive halving algorithms, suggested as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Novel Bandit-Based Approach to Hyperparameter Optimization</a> by Lisha Li and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mentioned that the successive halving method suffers from a trade off between selecting the number configurations and allocating the budget. To solve this problem, HyperBand proposed to frequently perform the successive halving method with different budgets to find the best configurations. In the below figure you can see HyperBand has better performance in comparison with random search.</p>

<h2>BOHB</h2>



<p>BOHB is a state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithm, proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale</a>, written by Stefan Falkner, Aaron Klein, and Frank Hutter. The idea behind the BOHB algorithm is based on one simple question – why do we run successive halving repeatedly?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of a blind repetition method on top of successive halving, BOHB uses the Bayesian Optimization algorithm. In fact, BOHB combines HyperBand and BO to use both of these algorithms in an efficient way. Dan Ryan explains the BOHB method in his presentation perfectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IqQT8se9ofQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Add it to your watch list</a>.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqQT8se9ofQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>

<p><em>A great <a href="https://youtu.be/IqQT8se9ofQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presentation</a> by Dan Ryan about Efficient and Flexible Hyperparameter Optimization on PyData Miami 2019</em></p>



<p>BOHB is a multi fidelity optimization method, and these methods depend on budget, so finding a consequential budget is important. On the other hand, BOHB is robust, flexible, and scalable. If you need more detailed info, you may want to check the official <a href="https://www.automl.org/blog_bohb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about BOHB by André Biedenkapp and Frank Hutter.</p>



<p>In addition, <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> is a nice implementation of BOHB and HyperBand. You can find its documentation <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/optimizers/bohb.html">here</a>.</p>






<h2 id="Comparison">Random Search vs HyperBand vs BOHB + Results comparison in Neptune</h2>



<p>Now that we know the descriptions and are familiar with the methods, let’s use <a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/mjbahmani/HyperBand-BOHB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neptune</a> to make some experiments and comparisons based on these methods.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along with me:</p>



<ul><li>Install <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> on your machine</li><li>Use the example from <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/auto_examples/example_5_mnist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this link</a>.</li><li>Set your configuration budget.</li><li>Do the same experiment for each optimizer.</li><li><a href="https://docs.neptune.ai/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Track the experiments with Neptune.</a></li></ul>



<p>Since I decided to do the experiment on an equal basis, I used <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> which has an implementation for BOHB, with HyperBand and RandomSearch as an optimizer. An official example can be found <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/auto_examples/example_5_mnist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. Based on this example, we have a small CNN in Pytorch which will be tuned for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MNIST</a> dataset. I ran this example based on three different optimizers:</p>



<ol><li>BOHB&nbsp;</li><li>HyperBand&nbsp;</li><li>RandomSearch.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>For each optimizer I used the following budgets:</p>




<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Configurations</th>
    <th>Range value</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Min budget</td>
    <td>[1]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Max budget</td>
    <td>[1,2,3,4,5]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of iteration</td>
    <td>[1,2,3,4,8,10]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>






<p>It means that we have run different combinations, at least 26 experiments to examine the capabilities of optimizers (BOHB, Hyperband, Random Search). In addition, through this example we want to find the best configuration for CNN based on the following hyperparameters.</p>




<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Range</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Learning rate</td>
    <td>[1e-6, 1e-2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of conv layers</td>
    <td>[1,3]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of filters in the first conf layer</td>
    <td>[4, 64]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dropout rate</td>
    <td>[0, 0.9]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of hidden units in fully connected layer</td>
    <td>[8,256]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>After running these experiments with various configurations in Neptune, I got some insightful results.</p>

<p>Here you can see a nice contrast between those optimizers for n_iteration=3 and max_budget=3. I find that if I increase the number of iterations, all optimizers finally get best performance, but when the budget is significant, BOHB could do it better.</p>

November 16, 2020 | https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who doesn’t love a good stack teardown? Ever since I saw <a href="https://cushionapp.com/running-costs/">Cushion’s running costs</a> page, I’ve been low key addicted to reading about how other apps are built.</p>
<p>I work on an app called <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> that helps musicians and podcasters make videos for social media. So in the spirit of the teardown, here are the tools and services I use to run it!</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list — I’ve omitted some obvious ones (like HTML) and ones that are implied by other tooling choices (like HCL for Terraform).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> — A superset of JavaScript with static types. I fell in love with this language when I first tried it a few years ago, and it’s only gotten better since then. I use it for both the frontend and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> — A superset of CSS with cool features like mixins and nesting. I use it for both the marketing site and — with <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS modules</a> — the web app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-systems-and-frameworks">Build Systems and Frameworks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> — The frontend is a single-page app built with React, which has been a great choice — it gets out of the way and lets me just work on the app. There might be other frameworks out there that are quote unquote better, but the sheer size of the React community means I basically never run into any uncharted territory.</li>
<li><a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> — A batteries-included build system for React. The first time I made a React app, I cobbled together the configuration for Webpack/Babel/etc myself. Create React App hides all that — with the option to “eject” and get the full configuration if I ever need to do something it doesn’t support.</li>
<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> — A Node.js server-side framework. Just like with React, I chose it because it’s the most popular by far. As for why I chose Node.js rather than another language, it’s because I need to run the same video rendering code in the browser and on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> — A fast static site generator written, used to build the marketing site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>This list is also not exhaustive, but there are too many libraries to name them all here, so I’ve tried to keep it to the most notable or interesting ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction">immer</a> — An intuitive, performant way to do immutability. It can also serialize patches you make to an object, so it’s fairly easy to implement undo functionality as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.downshift-js.com/">downshift</a> — A React library for building accessible dropdowns and multi-selects. Easy to style, and you get accessibility for free.</li>
<li><a href="https://popper.js.org/">popper</a> — A nifty little tooltip positioning library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas">node-canvas</a> — Node library for using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas API</a> on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> — Swiss army knife audio and video library. I use this to on the server convert audio files to WAV and to combine individual frames into users' videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> — Domain name registrar. Don’t get turned off by the slightly sketchy name — they’re my favorite registrar that I’ve used.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> — Provides DNS, SSL termination and DDOS protection for the websites and API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> — Hosts static files for the app frontend and marketing site. It’s really easy to use and there’s a generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> — Cloud infrastructure provider, but with plain Linux servers rather than proprietary services. I use them for servers, databases, and object storage to host users' file uploads and videos. Their web UI and API are both really easy to use; I never want to go back to AWS. <a href="https://m.do.co/c/e506b6f94e20">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> — Transactional email provider. I switched from <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> when I exceeded their free tier and couldn’t get in touch with support, and boy am I glad I did. Postmark’s delivery rate is better, and the dashboard is faster and easier to use. If you’re a bootstrapped startup, they’ll give you a <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/for/bootstrapped-startups">$75 credit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> — Relational database for persisting the app’s data. I briefly considered <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as well, but PostgreSQL has a bunch of really nice features like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/dml-returning.html">returning data from modified rows</a>. I did not consider non-relational databases like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> — Key/value store, only used for a task queue. Usually I would put this part off and just build a monolith, but CPU-intensive video rendering needs its own server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> — Time-series database for storing metrics. See the section on <a href="#monitoring">monitoring</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="servers">Servers</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> — The Linux distribution that the servers run. Like other parts of the stack, I chose it because it’s one of the most popular.</li>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> — A web server and reverse proxy, used here as a load balancer for the API servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a> — A daemon that manages the processes&nbsp;on the server, like Node.js and nginx. <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/">pm2</a> is another popular one, but it’s Node-specific.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>
<p>I’ve previously written about how I deploy SongRender, so you can <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/bluegreen-deploys-and-immutable-infrastructure-with-terraform/">read about it in more depth</a> if you’re interested. If you just want the high level, these are the tools involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> — An “infrastructure as code” tool, where you describe the infrastructure you want and it diffs with the infrastructure that actually exists. Kind of like React, but for configuration management. I love Terraform, and I use it to manage any infrastructure it supports.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> — A tool for building machine images. This makes it easy to deploy servers with Terraform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sentry.io/organizations/songrender/issues/">Sentry</a> — Error tracking. Picks up any uncaught exceptions in the client- and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">Statuscake</a> — Uptime monitoring, making sure the website and API don’t go down. Chosen for its generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.papertrail.com/">Papertrail</a> — Log management. It forwards system log messages using <code>rsyslog</code>, so I can just use <code>console.log</code> in my server-side code and have it picked up. At some point I might try to switch to a service that supports structured logs, like <a href="https://timber.io/">Timber</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/">Telegraf</a> — Agent that collects metrics from the servers and forwards them to InfluxDB. It makes it very easy to get metrics on CPU/memory/etc without paying an arm and a leg for something like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> — Metrics dashboard that displays data from InfluxDB and PostgreSQL. It’s easy to set up and use, and its visualizations are pretty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.indicative.com/">Indicative</a> — App analytics. I was using <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>, but I ended up exceeding their free tier — which was a shame, because I liked them a lot more. Might check out <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a> when I have time.</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> — Website visitor stats for the marketing page and app. It’s simpler than Google Analytics and only $15 per month for small sites. <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/WBX5G9">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search console</a> — Analytics about Google searches for which SongRender has shown up in the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> — Credit card processing and subscriptions. I <strong>love</strong> using Stripe. Their APIs are so well thought-out, the developer tooling is great and their documentation and dashboard are beautiful and easy to use. Their support is also responsive and helpful. I had such a positive experience with them that I registered SongRender LLC with Stripe Atlas, even though it cost a bit more than doing it manually.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> — Additional payment option. As happy as I am with Stripe, I’m that unhappy with PayPal: their tooling is lackluster, their documentation is not comprehensive and their website is slow. It’s also clearly not meant as a payment option for in-app purchases — for example, if you’re a new merchant, they’ll hold payments for a few weeks unless you upload a shipping label, which I obviously can’t do. People seem to like having it as a payment option, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> — My business bank. One of the three options Stripe recommended as part of Atlas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> — Vector graphics editor. I designed the SongRender logo using this, and I touch up icons with it too. I tend to go back and forth between this and <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, which I also really like — but there’s still an appeal to using a <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2020/10/26/part-of-your-world-why-we-re-proud-to-build-a-truly-native-mac-app/">native app</a> that doesn’t store all my data in the nebulous cloud.</li>
<li><a href="https://nucleoapp.com/">Nucleo</a> — Library of SVG icons. I bought the lifetime package years ago and have used it in basically every project since. <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/?ref=427">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">SVGOMG</a> — Nifty web app that cleans up and compresses SVGs. It’s basically a frontend for <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://squoosh.app/">squoosh</a> — Nitfy web app that compresses PNGs and JPGs; the raster image counterpart to SVGOMG.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> — Not quite a text editor, not quite an IDE. Probably the best Electron app I’ve ever used. I keep checking out <a href="https://nova.app/">Nova</a> out of a love for all things Panic, but it’s not quite there yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://postgresapp.com/">Postgres.app</a> — Simple free local PostgreSQL server for macOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate">dbmate</a> — Language- and database-agnostic migration tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> — Source code hosting and versioning.</li>
<li><a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> — Code formatter for JavaScript, HTML and CSS. If you’ve never used a code formatter before, do it now. It’ll change your life.</li>
<li><a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> — Test runner for JavaScript. Bundled with Create React App.</li>
<li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> — Alternative package manager for Node.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> — SongRender doesn’t need to be compiled, so this is just a task runner. <a href="https://www.thapaliya.com/en/writings/well-documented-makefiles/">Self-documenting Makefile snippets</a> are super helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> — Great indie Mac app for querying Postgres databases.</li>
<li><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> — HTTP client. I use this sometimes when I’m working on the API and don’t want to worry about the browser. I also use it as a very crude admin dashboard: the API has a few admin endpoints for things like retrying a failed render, which I hit directly from Insomnia. <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a non-Electron alternative that I’ll spend the $50 on at some point.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> — File transfer app. I use this whenever I need to poke around object storage, since it’s much easier than using DigitalOcean’s web-based file browser.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crisp.chat/">Crisp</a> — In-app support chat. It’s the slickest, least obtrusive one I could find with a free tier. I’d like to switch to <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> but can’t justify the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> — A kanban board for keeping track of bugs and features. A killer feature for me is the ability to add checklists to cards. Before I deploy a feature, I make an exhaustive checklist of cases to test. I’ve caught so many bugs this way; checklists should be a crucial tool in any developer’s QA arsenal. <a href="https://blog.nuclino.com/the-simple-genius-of-checklists-from-b-17-to-the-apollo-missions">Checklists work</a>! <a href="https://trello.com/jakelazaroff/recommend">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> — A repository for less structured note-taking.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> — The email provider I use <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/giving-up-google">instead of Gmail</a>. <a href="https://ref.fm/u20086848">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> — Raster&nbsp;image editor. I mostly use it as a lightweight Photoshop alternative when I need to tweak screenshots.</li>
<li><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> — Markdown …</li></ul></div></div>

<p><span>Maybe it came via email, or a direct message on social media. But the message is always the same: “I’ve found a great opportunity to make money, and I can get you in, too.”</span></p>
<p><span>Now, in the social media age, most of us know that </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/10-million-women-pitched-by-mlms/"><span>being approached with a message like that</span></a><span> usually means that someone wants us to join their multi level marketing scheme, or MLM. But what many people </span><i><span>don’t</span></i><span> know is that the message could mean something more sinister: That you’re being recruited for an illegal pyramid scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Many people refer to MLMs as pyramid schemes, and there’s a lot of confusion online about the difference between the two. So how do you know if that friend or family member is approaching you with a legitimate business opportunity, an outright scam, or something that lives in the gray area in between those two options?</span></p>

It’s no wonder —&nbsp;they have a lot of traits in common.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the Federal Trade Commission, a </span><b>pyramid scheme</b><span> is a scam that can look a lot like a legitimate business opportunity or an MLM, but the main difference is that pyramid schemes are set up to keep a constant flow of new recruits (and their money) coming into the business. Because of this, participants will often be heavily encouraged to recruit others (often their friends or family) to join.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a common misconception that if you’re asked to buy or sell a product, it’s not a pyramid scheme, but that isn’t true —&nbsp;pyramid scheme members are often asked to pay fees or consistently buy small amounts of product to keep their standing in the scheme, even if they still have a large amount of inventory they’ve been unable to sell.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A </span><b>multi level marketing scheme</b><span>, on the other hand, is not illegal. MLM companies sell products or services, and </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/the-mlm-epidemic-in-13-jaw-dropping-maps-2019-11-8/"><span>recruit salespeople</span></a><span> to market and sell them directly to their friends, families, and networks. MLM participants are usually referred to as “distributors,” “participants,” or “contractors,” and they are </span><b>not</b><span> employed by the MLM company —&nbsp;they work as independent contractors.</span></p>
<p><span>Participants in MLMs often also struggle to sell enough products to clear their inventory or reach sales goals that will earn them advertised rewards. But according to the FTC, what sets an MLM apart from a pyramid scheme is that, in an MLM, the company will pay its participants </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> for selling products, and while recruiting new members might help them earn more money, it’s not a requirement for membership.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll go into more detail below about how to recognize a pyramid scheme or MLM, what red flags to look out for, and how to protect yourself from scams and bad business opportunities.</span></p>

Luckily, the FTC provides a list on its website of possible warning signs.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters make extravagant promises about how much money you can earn</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Whether it’s a pyramid scheme or MLM, your earning potential can be limited by many factors outside of your control, and anyone promising you’ll earn a certain amount is not being truthful.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to join</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Often, they’ll play on your emotions (“You’d be a bad dad if you didn’t take advantage of this opportunity to support your family”) or create a false sense of urgency (“This deal will be off the table if you don’t join today”). These kinds of tactics are employed to get people to join without taking the time to research the company. A legitimate business opportunity won’t require you to make any hasty decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>If participants buy more products than they can use or sell, </b><span>it might be a pyramid scheme. Participants will be required to buy a certain amount to stay “active” in the organization, and so even if they already have an excess of inventory, they’ll be forced to buy more. If you see this happening, it’s a major red flag.</span></p>
<h3><span>What To Do If You Encounter a Pyramid Scheme</span></h3>
<p><span>If you ever encounter what you suspect to be a pyramid scheme (even if you aren’t 100 percent sure), you can report it to the FTC so they can investigate.</span></p>
<p><span>FTC reports can be made online at </span><a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&amp;panel1-1"><span>ftccomplaintassistant.gov</span></a><span>. Click “Education, Jobs, and Making Money,” and then select the option to submit a report about “Multi Level Marketing or Pyramid Schemes.” You’ll be taken to a series of forms where you can include all the details you know, so the FTC can decide whether it needs to launch a formal investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that the FTC won’t help you resolve an individual dispute, so if you’re looking to get money back after being recruited into a pyramid scheme, this avenue might not help you. But you have options for that, which we’ll explore more below.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to Recognize Multi Level Marketing (MLM)</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference that distinguishes multi level marketing (also called MLM or direct sales) is that members of an MLM won’t be strictly </span><i><span>required</span></i><span> to recruit new members in order to get paid. They should be paid for selling the company’s products or services, regardless of whether or not they recruit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How MLM Participants Make Money</span></h3>
<p><span>Often, MLMs are set up so participants receive a commission from the products they sell themselves, and then, often a smaller commission from the products sold by participants they’ve recruited (called their downline).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this makes it possible to earn money only from the commissions from your own product sales, making a significant amount of money would require selling massive amounts of products, and most people just don’t have customer networks that can support that. And so, in some of these companies, the only way to make significant amounts of money is to recruit many, many people and collect commissions on their sales, too.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though MLMs aren’t illegal, the FTC </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0065-multi-level-marketing-businesses-and-pyramid-schemes"><span>warns on its website</span></a><span> that </span><b>most of the people who join them make very little money</b><span>, and some even lose money. MLMs are structured so that only a small number of people who join the organization early on can typically recruit enough participants to reach high levels of income and rewards.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/5bpek0/within_15_cycles_you_run_out_of_people_the_math/"><span>where a Reddit user did the math</span></a><span>: Because of the way MLMs are structured, there simply aren’t enough people on earth to support enough recruitment for people outside of the top 2 or 3 levels to reach the highest status, income, and rewards offered by MLM companies. As that Reddit user’s spreadsheet shows, if each member recruited only five new members, within 15 cycles, they’d surpass the entire population of the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you’re lucky enough to be one of the first few sellers/recruiters to join an MLM, you might amass enough of a downline to earn a good living. Any later than that, and it may be actually impossible for you to recruit enough to make a significant income.</span></p>
<h3><span>Are MLMs Illegal?</span></h3>
<p><span>According to the FTC, truly legitimate MLMs are not scams or pyramid schemes, and are not illegal.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the FTC has </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/11/ftc-alleges-neora-formerly-known-nerium-operates-illegal"><span>filed numerous lawsuits</span></a><span>, including several </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/10/ftc-settlement-ends-advocares-alleged-pyramid-scheme-bans"><span>in the last few years</span></a><span>, against MLM companies that it says crossed the line and operated as pyramid schemes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This highlights an important lesson for anyone considering joining an MLM: </span><b>Just because an MLM company has been operating for a long time or seems legitimate, doesn’t mean it’s not a pyramid scheme</b><span>. It’s important to carefully research these companies before joining them, and to temper any expectations you might have about quick success or extravagant earnings.</span></p>
<p><span>That isn’t to say that MLMs are bad for </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> people. Some early joiners do make a lot of money. And some people join just to buy products they love at a discount, or to sell small amounts of product for a side income. MLMs should be approached with caution, and before joining one, you have to be OK with the possibility that you could lose money, or make very little.</span></p>
<h2><span>Have You Fallen Victim to a Pyramid Scheme or a Scammy MLM?</span></h2>
<p><span>If you encounter a pyramid scheme, you should </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/reports"><span>report it to the FTC</span></a><span> right away. And if you encounter an MLM that’s using shady sales tactics or misleading its members, you should report that, too.</span></p>
<p><span>But what about you? If you’ve lost money, or you’re looking for justice after a bad experience with these kinds of schemes, what legal options do you have?</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A year or so ago when I started my yourney into embedded development (to build a PID controller for my coffee machine) I bought a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_RGB_OLED_Module">1.5 inch RGB OLED display</a>, which uses a SSD1351 controller. I got lucky, because a display driver for it <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ssd1351">already existed</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, very recently it stopped working and I’m not sure why. Okay, maybe I tightened those screws a bit too much. Anyways, since I did not need a color display, I bought a very similar <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">1.5 inch OLED display</a>. After plugging it in and not seeing anything rendered on the screen (and not touching my screwdriver), I realized that it uses a different controller: the SSD1327. This time I wasn’t as lucky, because there happened to be no embedded rust driver out there yet.</p>
<p>When life gives you lemons, write a display driver for them - and then blog about it so everyone gets to learn maybe a thing or two.</p>
<p><img src="https://nitschinger.at/img/display-clean.jpg" alt="Display with Text"></p>
<p>The basic driver we are going to implement in this post works, but is neither flexible nor configurable. The full driver (which is still evolving) is goint to be a bit more complex and can be found <a href="https://github.com/daschl/ssd1327">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we dive in, we first need to figure out how to talk to the display and what protocol to use. The <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/a/ac/SSD1327-datasheet.pdf">Datasheet</a> is very handy and I recommend to keep it open in a separate tab while working on the code.</p>
<p>The controller supports different modes of communication: 4-wire SPI, 3-wire SPI, I2C, Parallel 6800 and Parallel 8080. In this blog post we’ll use 4-wire SPI which is the one the display comes preconfigured with. The bytes we send over SPI can either be commands (for example to turn the display on or off) or actual pixel data to render on the screen. The datasheet thankfully has all that info, but it can be a little tough to digest at first if you need to start from zero.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don’t need to start from zero. There are two very useful codebases out there which will help us hit the ground running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the demo code from the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">Waveshare Website</a>, which contains C code we can look at, which is very helpful especially to understand what commands we need to send during startup.</li>
<li>A controller driver for the very similar <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306">ssd1306</a> exists, and it is very well written. We can borrow some concepts like the command structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>We could directly talk to our hardware SPI interface, but that is not going to be very portable. Ideally we want to plug this display driver into the established embedded rust ecosystem and benefit from code reuse and portability. For our purpose, three crates are important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/therealprof/display-interface">display-interface</a>: traits that bridge between a bus driver (i.e. SPI) and a display driver (our ssd1327). By using this crate, we also open the door to support I2C later.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics">embedded-graphics</a>: once we can talk to the device, we also need to render pixels. This crate will make it super easy to render text, lines and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal">embedded-hal</a>: this is the main hardware abstraction layer crate and we’ll use it to talk to specific hardware pins and use time delay functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to make use of all three in the next sections.</p>

<p>Before we can render pixels on the screen, we need to initialize our display. The datasheet contains <em>a lot</em> of different commands, many of them are hardware oriented and it is pretty hard to figure out what we need. Thankfully, if we peek into the waveshare sample code, we can see a function like this:</p>
<div><div>

  Driver_Delay_ms(<span>200</span>);

  <span>//Turn on the OLED display
</span><span></span>  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xAF</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This gives us a first idea: we need to reset the display, then initialize it, sleep and then write <code>0xAF</code>. Searching for <code>AF</code> in the datasheet tells us that this command will turn the display on. Alright, let’s start with reset:</p>

  OLED_RST_1;
  Driver_Delay_ms(<span>100</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The code sets the RST (“reset”) pin from our display to high, then low and then high again, sleeping 100ms in between. So how would we translate that to rust?</p>

</div><p>The <code>embedded-hal</code> crate defines two important traits: one for an <code>OutputPin</code> and one to <code>Delay</code> for a certain number of milliseconds. The actual implementation comes from your board HAL (hardware abstraction layer), one of which we’ll see later. Also note that error handling is omitted here to simplify the code for this blog post.</p>
<p>Next up, we need to initialize the display. The C code is not very well documented, but we can see that a sequence of commands is sent to the display:</p>

  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xfd</span>);
  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0x12</span>);

}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For our rust code we want to turn those commands into an actual <code>enum</code> so it is easier to understand. We also need to implement the equivalent of <code>OLED_WriteReg</code>, which will send those commands to the display. This is where the <code>display-interface</code> crate comes in. The <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait it defines abstracts the actual low level communication for us and we just need to call the implementation of the trait.</p>
<p>The idea of the following code is shamelessly taken from the excellent <code>ssd1306</code> crate. Every command gets its own enum variant and we can <code>send</code> it to our display:</p>

    }
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For the actual driver we need more commands, but the approach is always the same. On <code>send</code> we match on the enum variant and turn it into a byte slice which is then sent over the connection through the <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait.</p>
<p><em>If you wonder why it specifies the length and data in such a weird way (as I did): if you try to return the array in the match arms rust will complain that the match arms have different array sizes. So the workaround by <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles">jamwaffles</a> is to always return a byte array with the same length, but then pass a slice of the correct size to the display. This makes the compiler happy and keeps the implementation short.</em></p>
<p>Before we can glue it all together, we need to figure out how we can send the pixel information to the display.</p>

<p>Our display has 128 rows and 128 colums with a potential of 16 colors each. 16 colors are represented by 4 bits, which is why the internal graphic display data RAM (GDDRAM) contains a buffer of <code>128 * 128 * 4 = 65536</code> bits. This allows to store all information for our 16384 pixels. Since rust does not have a <code>u4</code> datatype, we’ll use a single byte <code>u8</code> representation instead. This allows us to store the information of two pixels in one byte, so we need a buffer size of <code>65536 / 8 = 8192</code> bytes.</p>
<p>This is where <code>embedded-graphics</code> comes in. It defines a <code>DrawTarget</code> trait which we need to implement for our display. All we need to tell it is how to draw a pixel and what our display size is, and it will figure out the rest for us (i.e. drawing text or a shape):</p>

</div><p>The first thing to note is <code>Gray4</code> on the <code>DrawTarget</code>. Since this trait supports all kinds of displays, we need to tell it which pixel colors we support. <code>Gray4</code> indicates 4 bit grayscale, so exactly what we need. This is also highlights how we utilize rust’s type system to our benefit. We will only accept pixel colors that our device actually supports, any attempts to pass in i.e. a red color will fail at compile time.</p>
<p>In the <code>draw_pixel</code> method, we extract the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the pixel as well as its color through the <code>luma()</code> method. We first need to calculate the actual absolute position in our buffer based on the coordinates and then set the color on the element. Since we store 2 colors per byte the code needs to perform some bitshifting and either set the high or low 4 bits of the byte. This code has been taken from the waveshare C code and ported over to rust.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we have the answer to the NVIDIA A100 GPU from its chief (current) competitor, the AMD Instinct MI100. While the NVIDIA A100 GPU is getting a bump from 40GB to 80GB today, AMD is touting a new architecture specifically to deliver a lot of HPC flops at a low cost. Let us get into the new CDNA offering. <strong>Update</strong>: AMD let us know there is no “Radeon” in the product name since it is CDNA so we are updating the article to reflect that.<span id="more-48498"></span></p>
<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Background</h2>
<p>Keeping the background brief, the AMD Instinct MI100 is an architecture designed differently. AMD realized that traditional GPUs, insofar as they are “graphics” processing, are inefficient by including the logic that helps quickly render games. As a result, AMD split their GPU efforts into RDNA for the gaming community, as we covered in the recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-6800-xt-6800-rdna-2/">AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT 6800 XT and 6800 Launch</a>. For the data center, we have CDNA.</p>

<p>In all of these background slides, there are not so subtle jabs at NVIDIA. For example, above, we have “General Purpose” which is effectively NVIDIA’s Ampere design. Below, AMD is pointing out that it has public DoE exascale wins. Intel does as well (although perhaps HPE-Cray was the big winner here) and NVIDIA did not win in that first round of exascale contracts.</p>

<p>NVIDIA is doing more than high-performance computing for supercomputers with its chips, instead of focusing on AI acceleration with features such as supporting sparsity. As a result, the raw FP64 performance gains are not as large enough to meet exascale needs per AMD.</p>

<p>We can see that we have a 11.5 TFLOP (peak) GPU that fits into a standard PCIe Gen4 x16 slot. Something that we wanted to mention is that Infinity Fabric Link. The Instinct MI100 is designed to run in four GPU “hives” as shown in this article’s cover image. AMD is using Infinity Fabric to provide more performance than PCIe Gen4 for GPU-to-GPU communication much like NVIDIA NVLink. We asked AMD about the 32GB HBM2 capacity given NVIDIA was already at 40GB before the 80GB is being simultaneously announced with the MI100. AMD said it was a sweet spot to control costs for HPC customers much like HPC customers often care more about filling memory channels than with hitting high memory capacity on CPUs.</p>

<p>A lot of the speedup comes from the new pipeline. Here is what the “Enhanced Compute Unit” looks like. We have some readers that will skip this, other that will want to see details. AMD has a new whitepaper out with more details but otherwise, feel free to read the chart if you want to understand more about what AMD is doing at a very low level.</p>

<p>The net impact is that the AMD Instinct MI100 is a single 300W PCIe card that is 11.5 TFLOPs peak. AMD did an obligatory comparison of its new 300W PCIe GPU to the 2000 #1 supercomputer using 6MW and occupying many racks. 2000 was a long time ago in computing terms and back when Intel Pentium was still a premium brand.</p>

<p>A bit part of what AMD is discussing is compute per dollar and performance per dollar. Having less memory onboard its new 7nm GPU helps with 32GB of HBM2 versus 40GB or 80GB from NVIDIA. At the same time, with the new NVIDIA A100 80GB, NVIDIA can push the 40GB model pricing down which will have a big impact on the chart below.</p>

We will note that AMD is comparing to the MI60 here not the MI50 as it did above. AMD is also comparing to the NVIDIA V100, not the current generation A100.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the buyers of these supercomputers are very smart individuals. Clearly what AMD showed them with the MI100 and future generations was good enough that NVIDIA did not win these contracts. Of course, AMD is looking to future generations of GPUs for its exascale plans, but it needs to get industry software running on its GPUs. For that, AMD has ROCm which is updated as well.</p>
<h2>AMD ROCm 4.0 Updates</h2>
<p>Part of the news is that AMD ROCm 4.0 is out. With each generation of ROCm, the company is covering more use cases and scenarios. The company has a big task where GPU compute was largely pioneered on CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs. ROCm allows AMD and its customers to easily port CUDA applications and other components to run on AMD GPUs.</p>

<p>Next year with ROCm 5.0 we will likely see a bit more about how ROCm 4.0 is incomplete but ROCm 5.0 has complete coverage. At least that is what we have been trained to expect over the past few generations. ROCm 4.0 is delivering larger performance gains which makes porting less painful for existing GPU compute users.</p>

<p>This is an area where those exascale DoE contracts are helping. Part of the contracts were going beyond hardware but also for developing tooling around the next-gen systems. AMD is investing in ROCm to ensure the software can run on its flagship systems as they start arriving. Intel has been talking about the benefits of <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/great-2021-intel-xeon-sapphire-rapids-with-xe-ponte-vecchio-gpu-and-oneapi-at-sc19/">OneAPI</a>, but there is a good chance AMD will power the first exascale system.</p>
<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Partners</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, AMD’s design centers around a 4x GPU to CPU ratio. Here AMD is showing four AMD Instinct MI100 GPUs per “hive” and one hive per AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” CPU.</p>

<p>Supporting these designs are systems from HPE, Dell, Supermicro, and Gigabyte. The Dell EMC PowerEdge R7525 you may have seen in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-and-amd-showcase-future-of-servers-160-pcie-lane-design/">Dell and AMD Showcase Future of Servers 160 PCIe Lane Design</a> article. We expect these platforms to support the AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” generation as well.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>AMD is a few quarters behind NVIDIA launching the MI100 but well ahead of Intel’s Xe HPC part. With the big headliners of two major exascale supercomputers moving to AMD, we can imagine other smaller installations will look at what AMD is offering more seriously. It is good to see that AMD has a plan to close the software and capability gap with NVIDIA.</p>

<p>In a data sensitive application debugging is the most critical and time consuming especially if requests traffic is tremendously high, when it comes to debugging every developer’s last resort is application logs and debugging in large logs file is not an easy task.</p>



<div><p>In this post I will brief you about how we can make rails logs searchable, Using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat">Filebeat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic Stack</a>&nbsp;for making debugging fast and easy via&nbsp;UI enabled log search. Wait…, Filebeat is not a separate entity it falls under an elastic stack only which is a lightweight log shipper which will not hoard your resources.</p><p>This post will cover following&nbsp;</p></div>



<ul id="block-98606f77-5ee5-4d34-b8d1-5a5a51fb1195"><li>Brief intro to Elastic Stack</li><li>Filebeat configuration and setup</li><li>Custom Index Template with rollover for application logs</li><li>Lograge setup to output logs into JSON format</li><li>Demo Rails application&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pramodshinde/efk-rails">refer this repository</a></li></ul>



<h2>Brief&nbsp;about Elastic Stack</h2>



<p>Elastic stack comprises of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html">Elasticsearch</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana">Kibana</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/">Beats</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/logstash">Logstash</a>&nbsp;formerly known as the ELK Stack which is used to monitor, visualize, search and analyse the applications data in realtime and Filebeat is a lightweight data shipper belonging&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/">Beats family</a>&nbsp;which is mainly used to ship data from files.</p>



<h2>Filebeat setup and configuration</h2>



<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>



<p>Installation of filebeat is dead simple. You can follow simple steps described in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html">official documentation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Sample filebeat.yml</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<code>/usr/local/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml</code></p>



<pre>#---------- Filebeat inputs ----------
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  json:
    message_key: message
    keys_under_root: true
    overwrite_keys: true
  paths:
    - /Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log
#ElasticSearch template setting 
setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"
#---------- Kibana ----------
setup.kibana:
  host: "0.0.0.0:5601"
#---------- Elasticsearch output ----------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["0.0.0.0:9200"]
  index: "sync-log-dev"</pre>



<p>In above configuration file we have configured following options&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>inputs – Used for specifying input for filebeat, here we have configured input as rails log file&nbsp;<em><code>/Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log</code></em>&nbsp;with JSON option which will decode logs structured as JSON messages&nbsp;</li><li>output – Used to set the output for filebeat, here we will write to elasticsearch indexes.&nbsp;</li><li>setup.kibana – the Kibana endpoint which will load the kibana dashboard</li></ul>



<h2>Custom Index Template with rollover</h2>



<p>We off course can use the default&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-template.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/ilm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover</a>&nbsp;options but you cannot use the custom index template names, this is specially needed if you want the setup environment&nbsp;wise kibana dashboards on a single kibana and elasticsearch instances and this is what we needed in most of the Rails applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here we will use the custom template and index lifecycle management (ilm) for rotating our logs indexes as per different rails environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To enable a custom index template name and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/set-up-lifecycle-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover policy</a>&nbsp;you need to follow the following steps</p>



<ol><li>Setup a ilm enabled to false, add custom template name and pattern with following options</li></ol>



<pre>setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"</pre>



<p>Above config will tell filebeat to use&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-*</code>&nbsp;name and index pattern respectively, It’s a common practice to specify the index pattern rather than using index name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Create a life cycle policy using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _ilm/policy/sync-log
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "min_age": "0ms",
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_age": "3d",
            "max_size": "100mb"
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "2d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>Above will create a index lifecycle policy which will rollover indexes if its size reaches to 100mb or index age is 3 days whichever turns first true.</p>



<p>3. Create template pattern using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _template/efk-rails-sync-dev
{
  "index_patterns": ["efk-rails-sync-dev-*"], 
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "index.lifecycle.name": "sync-log", 
    "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "sync-log-dev" 
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create a template&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;with index alias&nbsp;<code>sync-log-dev</code>&nbsp;and attach lifecycle policy&nbsp;<code>sync-log</code>that created in step 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. In last step we will create the first index managed by a policy that uses the rollover action and designate it as the write index</p>



<pre>PUT efk-rails-sync-dev-000001 
{
  "aliases": {
    "sync-log-dev":{
      "is_write_index": true
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create initial index&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-000001</code>&nbsp;which will be used by filebeat to write output of application.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Application logs in JSON format&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you create index life cycle policy, template and first rollover index which will capture logs from filebeat harvester. You need make your application logs to output in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>To output rails logs into JSON format, we are using&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/roidrage/lograge" target="_blank">lograge</a>&nbsp;gem once you add it in Gemfile and bundle install it will be available to use in you application.&nbsp;</p><p>For demo purpose, We will be logging only single controller actions into JSON and search via Kibana.&nbsp;</p><p>Following lograge configuration will output logs in JSON for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>$config/initializers/lograge.rb</p>



<pre>Rails.application.configure do
  config.lograge.enabled = true
  config.lograge.keep_original_rails_log = true
  config.lograge.base_controller_class = 'ActionController::API'
  config.lograge.logger = ActiveSupport::Logger.new "#{Rails.root}/log/sync_#{Rails.env}.log"
  config.lograge.formatter = Lograge::Formatters::Json.new
  config.lograge.ignore_custom = lambda do |event|
    # return true here if you want to ignore based on the event
    return false if event.payload[:controller].include?("SyncController") &amp;&amp;
     ['index', 'create'].include?(event.payload[:action])
    return true
  end
  config.lograge.custom_payload do |controller|
    if controller.class.name.include?('SyncController')
      SyncLogger.new(controller).log_data
    end
  end
end</pre>



<p>SyncLogger service to add some meta data to logger file</p>



<p>$app/services/sync_logger.rb</p>



<pre>class SyncLogger
  def initialize(controller)
    @controller = controller
  end
  def log_data
    request_type = @controller.request.method
    username = @controller.current_user.try(:username) || 'guest'
    r_data = request_type == 'GET' ? JSON.parse(@controller.response.body) : @controller.request.parameters
    log_data = {
      u_agent: @controller.request.user_agent,
      request_time: Time.now.to_s(:number),
      search_key: "#{request_type}_#{username}_#{Time.zone.now.to_s(:number)}",
      ip: @controller.request.ip,
      user_id: @controller.current_user.try(:id),
      username: username,
      data: r_data
    }
  end
end</pre>



<p>Above service will create JSON output for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action in following format&nbsp;</p>



<p>$log/sync_development.log</p>



<pre>{"method":"GET","path":"/sync","format":"*/*","controller":"SyncController","action":"index","status":200,"duration":16.64,"view":1.18,"db":0.2,"u_agent":"PostmanRuntime/7.26.1","request_time":"20200818210529","search_key":"GET_pramod_20200818153529","ip":"127.0.0.1","user_id":1,"username":"pramod","data":[{"username":"pramod"},{"username":"pramdo1"}]}
{"method":"GET","path":"/sync","format":"*/*","controller":"SyncController","action":"index","status":200,"duration":15.82,"view":0.48,"db":0.93,"u_agent":"PostmanRuntime/7.26.1","request_time":"20200818210647","search_key":"GET_pramod_20200818153647","ip":"127.0.0.1","user_id":1,"username":"pramod","data":[{"username":"pramod"},{"username":"pramdo1"}]}</pre>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-starting.html" target="_blank">Starting filebeat</a>&nbsp;to ship above logs to elasticsearch by executing following command from the root of the filebeat if you have downloaded the tar and extracted it or if you have installed filebeat as a service you can start filebeat as a service</p>



<pre>./filebeat -e
or 
sudo service filebeat start</pre>



<p>You should see following filebeat logs on successful</p>

<h2>Kibana in Action</h2>



<p>If above all is set correctly, We can search logs via Kibana by creating index pattern. You should see `efk-rails-sync-dev-000001` index in kibana index management, Using same index you can create index pattern for search.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



		<div>



			
<p>In Denmark it is possible to register domains with funny characters such as æ, ø and å. And we do. One prominent example is our national portal for booking Covid-19 tests at <a href="https://xn--coronaprver-ngb.dk/">https://coronaprøver.dk</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">Wikipedia calls these beasts Internationalised domain names</a>, so they must indeed exist.</p>



<p>Recently I quit my job (have a new one now, luckily) and found myself making posts on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">social network known as LinkedIn</a> to improve my prospects.</p>



<p>One of these posts was about about a hobby project I made called <a href="https://wishlist.dk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wishlist.dk">wishlist.dk</a>, an ad free wish registry. The big player on the Danish wish registry market (what a market: it seems every novice web developer in Denmark has launched one of these) is <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/">https://<strong>ø</strong>nskeskyen.dk</a>.</p>



<p>What I wanted to let my network know was something like:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I have launched wishlist.dk – a gratis, ad and surveilance free alternative to evil wish list giant ønskeskyen.dk”</p><cite>– Morten Helmstedt, job seeker</cite></blockquote>



<p>Alas, LinkedIn’s URL parser breaks in many ways when trying to express your career news and feelings through internationalised domain names.</p>



<h3>How do thee fail? Let me count the ways.</h3>



<p>When making a post on LinkedIn with an URL, LinkedIn will try to:</p>



<ul><li>Create a preview of the first URL in the post</li><li>Create a short link for all URLs in the post containing a path (e.g. https://lindkedin.com/<em>path</em>), not for top level domains and subdomains without a path. It will generally look like and point to something like <em>https://lnkd.in/eCTD8Q9</em></li></ul>



<p>Here are the bugs I noticed in action:</p>



<h4>Posting like a sane person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="545" height="352" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png 545w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"><figcaption>Trying to post an internationalised domain name like any sane person would. Post preview fails to load. The link in the post itself works as expected, though.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Posting like a LinkedIn person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="550" height="648" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png 550w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2-255x300.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><figcaption>Whois’ing the “real” domain name and posting it like no true Dane would. Post preview succeeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Things go from bad to worse when trying to post an internationalised domain name with a path such as <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://ønskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a>.</p>



<p>If I just post that URL, I get a post like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png" alt="" width="540" height="142" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png 540w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>LinkedIn shortens the link to make it more readable and to be able to track our smallest actions on the world wide web.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What happens when I click the link is this:</p>



<h4>INVALID REDIRECT</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="773" height="319" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png 773w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-300x124.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px"><figcaption>An error! (Invalid redirect)</figcaption></figure>



<p>My browser (Firefox) tries to GET the URL and is redirected to <em>linkedin.com/slink</em>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="374" height="235" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png 374w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px"><figcaption>A 301 redirect in action!</figcaption></figure>



<p>And then:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="357" height="381" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png 357w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px"><figcaption>The submitted URL is stored, but the location should probably be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://%C3%B8nskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a> or maybe even <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies</a>. Who knows? It’s complicated. LinkedIn engineers should definitely look into this!</figcaption></figure>



<h2>How I tried to fix this mess</h2>



<p>Well, I contacted LinkedIn on Twitter (WHAT!), tried e-mailing their security e-mail (no reply, of course, but only e-mail I could find) and got in touch with a very understanding Member Support Consultant named Vegard who tried his/her best:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="797" height="508" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png 797w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-300x191.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px"><figcaption>Pretty impressive response after describing the problem.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>If our URL parser doesn’t work, just change your URL</h4>



<p>But then the engineering team told me that I should just stop posting internationalised domain names to LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png" alt="" width="610" height="471" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png 808w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-300x232.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-768x593.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"><figcaption>True for Chrome, not for Firefox, not from a usability perspective</figcaption></figure>



<p>I tried to have Vegard tell the engineers at LinkedIn to read up on internationalised domain names, but no such luck: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="793" height="571" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png 793w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-300x216.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-768x553.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"><figcaption>The sorry end.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>THE END</h2>



<h2>An aside:</h2>



<p>As another hobby project, I created <a href="https://lnk.dk/">lnk.dk</a>, a very simple short link generator (like wish registries, it seems every aspiring web developer in Denmark has made one of these). Using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>‘s built in <code>URLField</code> I can validate, store and correctly redirect internationalised domain names with hardly any work at all on my part.</p>



<p><em>If only tools like that were available for the engineers at LinkedIn to use for their URL parsing and shortening…</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>tldr: it’s back now!</p>



<p>At 00:42 in the early morning of November 16 (my time, Central European Time), I received an email saying that “someone” logged into my twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/bagder">@bagder</a> from a new device. The email said it was done from Stockholm, Sweden and it was “Chrome on Windows”. (I live Stockholm)</p>



<p>I didn’t do it. I don’t normally use Windows and I typically don’t run Chrome. I didn’t react immediately on the email however, as I was debugging curl code at the moment it arrived. Just a few moments later I was forcibly logged out from my twitter sessions (using tweetdeck in my Firefox on Linux and on my phone).</p>



<p>Whoa! What was that? I tried to login again in the browser tab, but Twitter claimed my password was invalid. Huh? Did I perhaps have the wrong password? I selected “restore my password” and then learned that Twitter doesn’t even know about my email anymore (in spite of having emailed me on it just minutes ago).</p>



<p>At 00:50 I reported the issue to Twitter. At 00:51 I replied to their confirmation email and provided them with additional information, such as my phone number I have (had?) associated with my account.</p>



<p>I’ve since followed up with two additional emails to Twitter with further details about this but I have yet to hear something from them. I cannot access my account.</p>



<p><strong>November 17</strong>: (30 hours since it happened). The name of my account changed to Elon Musk (with a few funny unicode letters that only look similar to the Latin letters) and pushed for bitcoin scams.</p>



<p>Also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25120918">mentioned on hacker news</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jvor6q/daniel_stenbergs_curl_twitter_account_compromised/">reddit</a>.</p>



<p>At 20:56 on November 17 I received the email with the notice the account had been restored back to my email address and ownership.</p>



<p>Left now are the very sad DM responses in my account from desperate and ruined people who cry out for help and mercy from the scammers after they’ve fallen for the scam and lost large sums of money.</p>



<h2>How?</h2>



<p>A lot of people ask me how this was done. The simple answer is that I don’t know. At. All. Maybe I will later on but right now, it all went down as described above and it does not tell how the attacker managed to perform this. Maybe I messed up somewhere? I don’t know and I refuse to speculate without having more information.</p>



<p>I’m convinced I had 2fa enabled on the account, but I’m starting to doubt if perhaps I am mistaking myself?</p>



<h2>Why me?</h2>



<p>Probably because I have a “verified” account (with a blue check-mark) with almost 24.000 followers.</p>



<h2>Other accounts</h2>



<p>I have not found any attacks, take-overs or breaches in any other online accounts and I have no traces of anyone attacking my local computer or other accounts of mine with value. I don’t see any reason to be alarmed to suspect that source code or github project I’m involved with should be “in danger”.</p>

    <div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>Last Friday, Apple released <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/">Big Sur,</a> the latest version of macOS. While everyone else was busy downloading GBs of data from Apple’s servers, I took a different, less beaten path. Meet my new best friend, Ubuntu:</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://preslav.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 600w, https://preslav.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 1000w, https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Those who follow this blog would recall that I have been <a href="https://preslav.me/2020/08/02/in-search-of-a-new-laptop/">looking for</a> an alternative to an Apple-dominated ecosystem for quite some time. While I tried different laptops, I never really got the same feeling of attachment that I have to my model 2015 MacBook Pro. It turns out, I like and respect older Apple hardware. There are tons of it out there, still in perfect working condition, waiting to be repurposed and made usable again. Yet, every newer generation of macOS would offer less and less of its capabilities. Sometimes, even intentionally hampering what one could tinker around within the name of “safety and integrity protection”.</p><p>In my view, 2015 was the last year any robust and sustainable laptops came out of there. You don’t have to agree with me.</p><p>So, I ran around looking for other options. An obvious choice would have been running Windows 10 on Bootcamp and trying to get my Linux experience with the WSL2. I am sure that it would have worked fine. But again, we are speaking about slightly older hardware here that we still want to use for writing software. Running Linux inside a VM, even as lightweight as the WSL2 was not an option, I’d be happy with. There was only one other option to get the Linux experience I wanted …</p><h2 id="running-linux-on-a-mac-does-that-even-work">Running Linux on a Mac? Does that even work?</h2><p>It does better than I and probably many of you would have expected. Both visually and under the hood, I am getting more out of the hardware than Catalina (ugh), or possibly, Big Sur would have managed to squeeze. If you use apps that have support or alternatives on other platforms and choose to go for a no-brainer distribution like Ubuntu, you won’t feel a difference in your end experience at all. Ubuntu’s default GUI is modern and snappy. Some even claim that Big Sur looks a lot more like Gnome or KDE than any previous version of macOS. Of course, Linux being open, if the default environment feels heavy for your hardware, one can always choose one from the myriads of other GUI options available on the Linux Universe.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-installation-process">What about the installation process?</h2><p>In my case, the installation was super smooth as well. I baked an Ubuntu image on a Micro SD card (works too, if you don’t have a USB stick) using <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balenaEtcher</a>. Before the installation, one has the option to try Ubuntu live by directly booting off the Micro SD (or USB stick). Simply,press Alt during boot, wait a few seconds and choose “EFI Boot” from the available options. I highly recommend to anyone to spend as much time as possible playing around before installing. I had written down a huge checklist of things I wanted to make sure I check before I even go and prepare my SSD for the installation. Make sure you have tested your WiFi, sound, Bluetooth, etc. I was lucky enough that my WiFi worked out of the box, but this might not be the case with other Macs. A working Internet connection is very important during the installation, so if your WiFi doesn’t happen to work, make sure you grab an Ethernet cable (and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter if necessary) before you move on.</p><p>I will be brief about the rest of the process since everything is explained in detail in the guide I followed:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/how-to-install-linux-on-a-macintosh-computer/">How to install Linux on a Macintosh and dual boot with macOS</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><br>If you only have 256 GB SSD or less and want to keep your existing macOS available, be prepared for a lot of space freeing and partitioning your drive. I freed up 100 GB for Ubuntu and left some 4 GB for a swap partition. I intend to be able to reduce my macOS partition even further, eventually increasing the size of my Linux storage.</p><p>Once partitions were in place, installation and booting from Linux were no problem at all. In case they happen to be, the guide above explains how to set up a more advanced boot loader.</p><h2 id="what-i-am-still-struggling-with">What I am still struggling with</h2><p>Surprisingly little. Bigger things are the sound coming out of the audio jack (though speakers work perfectly), and maintaining proper scaling across my laptop’s screen and my external monitor. The latter one is more of a general issue on pretty much all OSes. I was positively surprised that Ubuntu picked up the native resolutions of both displays, so my picture was crystal sharp, albeit very small,and required adjusting some scaling. More minor issues include not being able to scroll with my Magic Mouse, and of course, having to learn to use Ctrl instead of Cmd for pretty much all things. I am sure though that given time, I will find appropriate solutions for all those things. None of them bothers me nearly enough to make me switch back.</p><p>I will try to report more on my experience after some time has passed. For now, I am more than happy.</p></div>

</header>
<p>In this article we are going to talk continuous testing and packaging in Common Lisp. The goal is to automate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Report coding errors on every push, including pull requests. This prevents unseen, long-standing breakages, and also helps with pull requests since the system will automatically report failing tests, compilation warnings, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Ease the release process by automating package builds. This allows us to release often with a higher level of guarantees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since Nyxt is currently hosted on GitHub, we are leveraging GitHub Actions for our continuous integration. Even though we are using GitHub Actions, we've designed our process to be platform independent. As a result, our GitHub-specific code remains small and trivial.</p>

<p>Some Common Lisp compilers are particularly good at code analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No false positives, all warnings are meaningful.</p></li>
<li><p>They catch many errors at compile time, including typing errors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> and <a href="https://ccl.clozure.com/">CCL</a> are two high-quality compilers that fit the bill. While only SBCL is officially supported to build Nyxt, CCL proves useful in catching some error and warning classes that SBCL misses. In particular, CCL is better at type-checking class slots.</p>
<p>Let's review what we want to automate to increase our quality assurance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Build: The project compiles with all compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing: All test suites pass with all compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Code checking: No warnings are reported with any compiler.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the last two points suffice since the code checking is done by building the project.</p>
<p>Allow me to emphasize the importance of code checking: since the compilers don't report false positives, this forces us to have warning-free code at all time, which is a big boost for quality assurance!</p>
<h2 id="automatic-build">Automatic build</h2>
<p>First we need to set up the GitHub action in this <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/.github/workflows/tests.yml">YAML file</a>.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We install the Nyxt dependencies using the image package manager, here APT.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we install <a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">Roswell</a>, a tool that will allow us to easily install the desired Common Lisp compilers since the host system package managers may not have them. Roswell includes <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, so we will leverage this to install all the Common Lisp dependencies of Nyxt.</p></li>
<li><p>Some dependencies are missing from Quicklisp, so we fetch them via our Makefile dedicated rule, then register their location as per the <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/Configuration-DSL.html#Configuration-DSL">ASDF API</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automatic-testing">Automatic testing</h2>
<p>Finally, we run the following:</p>

<p>We load the tests which builds Nyxt itself. If the Nyxt build fails, the error is reported as part of the workflow.</p>
<p>We exit with a custom non-zero error code, here 17. This can help identify the cause of the error in case the output gets confusing.</p>
<p>The rest of the test controls happens in the <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/nyxt.asd">nyxt.asd</a> file. Our main <code>:nyxt</code> system lists all the tests so that call <code>(asdf:test-system :nyxt)</code> effectively runs the whole test suite.</p>
<p>Each individual test system is specified in the following form:</p>

<p>We've rolled out our own helper function <code>nyxt-run-test</code> to factor some recurring code.</p>

<p>We've added some knobs that we can control externally:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the <code>NYXT_TESTS_NO_NETWORK</code> environment variable is set, the test is not run. This is useful to disable tests require a network connection. Some build systems (like Guix) disable network connectivity during builds.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>NXYT_TESTS_ERROR_ON_FAIL</code> is set, the process will exit with a non-zero error code, which will cause the build system, or the integration pipeline to fail and report. This is necessary because otherwise the ASDF test operation does not "fail" in the sense that the process returns the 0 error code by default.</p>
<p>In the YAML file, we set this variable to <code>yes</code>, thus externally commanding our test suite to reflect its error on the pipeline.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automatic-code-checking">Automatic code checking</h2>
<p>Finally, our last step in our YAML file is very simple: it loads a file and executes the <code>compilation-conditions</code> function on systems we want to test, here <code>nyxt</code> and the renderers.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/report-warnings.lisp">this file</a> more closely:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First <code>compilation-conditions</code> calls <code>load-system-silently</code> on the recursive dependencies of the system as returned by <code>list-dependencies</code>.</p>
<p>We do this to <em>pre-compile</em> the Nyxt dependencies, thus ensuring that when we compile Nyxt the compiler only reports warnings related to Nyxt and not its dependencies.</p>
<p><code>load-system-silently</code> is like ASDF's <code>load-system</code> but muffles the output to keep the pipeline output shorter.</p></li>
<li><p>An amazing feature of Common Lisp is that the <code>compile</code> function is built into the language, which allows us to control the compilation process in Common Lisp itself!</p>
<p>Thus we collect all conditions that are not redefinitions:</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/comments/jadiv0/how_can_i_report_compilation_warnings_in_ci/g8s5oj4/"><span data-cites="phoe">@phoe</span></a> for this tip!</p>
<p>Note to the attentive reader: <code>redefinition-p</code> is not the proper way to check if a condition is a redefinition. The redefinition condition type is not portable, so the code should be different between SBCL and CCL, but it turns out that this "hack" works in our case.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we report the conditions to the standard output (which will display in the continuous testing web interface) and return a custom non-zero error code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since none of us at Atlas are using a Debian-based distribution such as Ubuntu, and since these distributions are among the most popular platforms, it has become increasingly necessary to automate the process of distributing a pre-built <code>.deb</code> package</p>
<p>Automating packaging is no simple task, for this we leverage the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ralt/linux-packaging">linux-packaging</a> Common Lisp library, which itself is based on <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a>.</p>
<p>Beside wrapping <code>fpm</code>, <code>linux-packaging</code> automatically guesses the operating system dependencies for the FFI libraries and statically links the FFI-generated objects into the Lisp image. No more problem distributing <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/osicat/">Osicat</a>!</p>
<p>As for continuous testing, we have a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/.github/workflows/package-ubuntu.yml">YAML file</a> which has roughly the same steps except that we don't leverage Roswell here because we are going to build our own SBCL compiler: indeed, <code>linux-packaging</code> requires SBCL to be built with the non-default <code>--with-sb-linkable-runtime</code> option.</p>
<p>Notice the new dependency line:</p>

<p>Ruby is required for <code>fpm</code> and SBCL for… rebuilding SBCL!</p>
<p>Not much here since everything happens in the <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/build-ubuntu-package.sh">build-ubuntu-package.sh</a> script:</p>
<ul>
<li>We first install <code>fpm</code>.</li>
<li>Then we build <code>SBCL</code> with the <code>--with-sb-linkable-runtime
 --with-sb-dynamic-core</code> options.</li>
<li>We install Quicklisp manually since this time we don't have Roswell.</li>
<li>We install <code>linux-packaging</code>.</li>
<li>Pitfall: We install a modern version of ASDF since <code>linux-packaging</code> requires a version that's more recent than the one shipped with SBCL (at least as of 2.0.10).</li>
<li>As for continuous testing, we register the current directory in the ASDF registry so that it finds the Nyxt ASDF systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the package build happens in the last command:</p>

<p><code>quickload</code> will drag all <code>linux-packaging</code> and <code>nyxt</code> dependencies. Then we load and make an ASDF system that's dedicated to the creation of the package.</p>
<p>This system is declared in a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/nyxt-ubuntu-package.asd">separate file</a> because otherwise it would make Nyxt depend on <code>linux-packaging</code>, which the end user does not need.</p>
<p>Let's review it:</p>

<p>Here we declare that loading this system will trigger the <code>linux-packaging:build-op</code> operation which will generate a <code>linux-packaging:deb</code> package.</p>
<p>Notice that there is only one knob to control the type of package we want to produce. It's enough to change this value to <code>linux-packaging:rpm</code> to produce an RPM!</p>

<p>Here we list the Common Lisp systems we want to include in our image. Since <code>nyxt/gtk</code> depends on everything else, it's the only system that we need to list.</p>
<p>The <code>:entry-point</code> is the same we use to build Nyxt from the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>Here we list all the metadata for the <code>.deb</code>. Since we decided to store this system in a separate <code>.asd</code> file, it can't automatically inherit from the metadata of the <code>nyxt</code> system. So we need to use a reader macro to explicitly tell ASDF to look for the metadata of Nyxt.</p>

<p>The attentive reader may have noticed that I said that <code>linux-packaging</code> automatically derived the operating system dependencies for FFI packages. Indeed, we don't need to declare that WebKitGTK is a dependency here for instance.</p>
<p>However, some of our code has optional dependencies. While WebKitGTK would work without <code>glib-networking</code> it would have limited functionality, like no HTTPS support.</p>
<p>Other dependencies include those that are typically used by Common Lisp libraries that depend on executables, like <a href="https://github.com/snmsts/trivial-clipboard">trivial-clipboard</a> which depends on an external clipboard program like <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we list all the assets to include in the <code>.deb</code>: icons, <code>.desktop</code> file, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>build-pathname</code> field is the name of the produced executable which will be automatically stored to <code>/usr/bin</code> in the package.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Guix test and packaging</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/guix.scm">Guix recipe</a> to build Nyxt using the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> package manager. There are many benefits in providing a Guix package, among others it allows us to provide a create a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2018/tarballs-the-ultimate-container-image-format/">Guix pack</a> which is an self-containing, portable tarball that can be unpacked and run on any operating system with a Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Another benefit of packaging for Guix is that it uses its own Common Lisp packages instead of Quicklisp to manage the Common Lisp dependencies. This validates our quality assurance one step further.</p></li>
<li><p>Code coverage</p>
<p>SBCL supports coverage reporting thanks to its <code>sb-cover</code> extension. We hope to make use of it to provide the most exhaustive test suite possible.</p></li>
</ul>

                    <h2>Feeling great</h2>
<p>What do you want people to feel when they talk to you? Happiness, sadness or maybe everything combined? </p>
<p>Do you want people to be inspired or motivated to tackle new and exiting problems? </p>
<p>Do you want to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>I think to understand your life purpose, you gotta understand yourself first. Not in a psychoanalytical way, but in a spiritual and reflectional way.</p>
<p>Don’t beat yourself up. Make yourself proud inside of you. If you are proud of what you do, then it means that you are following your heart. If you are following your heart, you are doing the best work you can, because there are too many people that do things for money. If you want to succeed, then there is no better strategy than that.</p>
<p>Live the life that you would feel proud about telling your grandchildren. Live the life that would inspire your children and will set a good role model for them. Be a person that is open to every opportunity, but chooses only those that align with their goals. Be open to success and closed for disappointment.</p>
<p>Shoot each time you have an idea, and don’t afraid to fail. You can miss and embers yourself just a little. Or you can never shoot and never achieve anything in life. Which one sounds worse?</p>
<h2>Understand your surrounding</h2>
<p>The most important part of being successful is in alignment with your surrounding.</p>
<p>Look around yourself. Do your habits improve it? Do people around you improve and getter better because of your actions? Are you on your way to helping others?</p>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the language that we have developed is the biggest indicator of that. If we could survive alone, we wouldn’t have needed a language to communicate. </p>
<p>You need to check up on others and help them. This will cause a domino effect, and in the end, you will benefit even more from that.</p>
<p>You are 5 people who you spend most of your time with. List those people and check if they are improving you and your well being, or are they destroying it? It is essential to make those 5 people stronger and better than you. This will allow you to grow, which will allow you that effect to trickle to other people, improving their lives.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to try</h2>
<p>If you have a particular thing that you want to experiment, calculate how much will it cost. Mostly the things we are the most afraid of trying or doing we can try or do for less than $500 and the drawbacks are not irreversible.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shoot and fail. Try and see how it goes. You can always roll back to the point of start.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>Brought to you by the “I hate Mondays” department of Tales Of A Tech.</p>
<p>We would like to remind you that if there is a problem and you can’t seem to figure it out there’s always one solution to look to: It’s ALWAYS DNS.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>Last night I was trying to login to this site in order to make a post about my drone shenanigans (which, by the way, is <a href="https://talesofatech.com/2017/03/drone-shenanigans/">here</a>). &nbsp;I was already super frustrated because Mass Effect: Andromeda is coded by a team of (apparently) monkeys who don’t understand how to make working autosave features (my autosave files are all corrupt, causing me to lose 5+ hours of gameplay) and the site wasn’t being cooperative. &nbsp;I was reaching “blow-your-top” levels of frustration. &nbsp;I was finally able to connect and login but I immediately noticed things were running VERY slowly. &nbsp;It was weird, and I couldn’t figure out why. EVERYTHING seemed slow. &nbsp;Even the SSH connection was jittery and laggy.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a problem with the network in the apartment. &nbsp;It happens from time to time. &nbsp;We run a lot of equipment in our apartment. &nbsp;I ran some speed tests and some other diagnostics and found that everything seemed to be working. &nbsp;Very weird.</p>
<p>Since I managed to SSH in I decided to check some logs. &nbsp;There didn’t seem to be anything in the apache log. &nbsp;fail2ban wasn’t being uncooperative. MySQL was running and seemingly accepting localhost connections. &nbsp;Very weird. &nbsp;I resorted to the only thing I could think of next: I rebooted the box.</p>
<p>Everything&nbsp;came back up (yay) but the site was still clunky and slow (not so yay).</p>
<p>I decided to enable verbose logging in apache and attempt to restart the service. &nbsp;It timed out. The hell?</p>
<p>I ran “journalctl -xe” per service failure message and noticed a peculiar entry:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: apache2.service: Start operation timed out. Terminating.
Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: Failed to start The Apache HTTP Server.</pre>
<p>Failed to start due to timeout? &nbsp;Timeout of what? SO CONFUSED.</p>
<p>Digging back a little further I saw another confusing line:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:15:12 TalesOfAnAdmin apachectl[1860]: [Mon Mar 27 21:15:12.835322 2017] [core:error] [pid 1864] (EAI 2)Name or service not known: AH00547: Could not resolve host name maplerangers.com</pre>
<p>Huh. &nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>I had a quick confab with Nick and he suggested I check if my websites were in my hostfile. &nbsp;They weren’t, so I added them. &nbsp;Apache startup became instantaneous. &nbsp;Things seemed to be improving. &nbsp;Cool.</p>
<p>I logged in to the website which was up and more responsive, but absolutely slow. &nbsp;Very weird still. &nbsp;I noticed an error on my WordPress Administration page: “curl error 28: operation timed out”</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>So back to the SSH I go. &nbsp;I try pinging wordpress.com: &nbsp;Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging google.com: Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging an IP Address for those sites: Working fine.</p>
<p>Grrrr!</p>
<p>I look at /etc/resolv.conf — I’m using Google DNS. &nbsp;Ok.</p>
<p>Let’s see if DigitalOcean has anything about this: Bingo!</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our engineering team is investigating reports of DNS connectivity issues while using the Google resolvers. During… <a href="https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq">https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq</a></p>
<p>— DigitalOcean Status (@DOStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/DOStatus/status/846430105094250496">March 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I edit the resolv.conf (and interfaces) to reflect a change to OpenDNS as the primary DNS with Google as the fallback DNS (as per the article linked later in the Tweet).</p>
<p>Restart networking.</p>
<p>Boom, everything is working.</p>
<p>It was DNS.</p>
<p><span><strong>It’s always DNS.</strong></span></p>
<p>-M, out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Message queues are one of the critical components in any software architecture which helps different components talk to each other asynchronously. In this article let's discuss what message queues are, how they're used in modern architectures and what problems do they solve.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to withdraw some money from an ATM. An ATM machine can only allow one person to do transactions at a time. In this case, what do you do when you see there's a person already using the ATM machine? Do you wait in a queue or do you go back thinking you cannot withdraw money from this machine?</p>
<p>Exactly! You wait in a queue until your turn comes.</p>
<p>So when many people want to withdraw money they will have to wait in a queue and go to the ATM machine in the same order in which they entered the queue. This is one real world example of queues and message queues serve the same purpose in any software architecture.</p>
<p>We will talk about below topics in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are">What are message queues?</a></li>
<li><a href="#used-how">How are message queues used in a system?</a></li>
<li><a href="#problems">What problems do message queues solve?</a></li>
<li><a href="#properties">Other properties of message queues</a></li>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h3>
<p>A queue is a First-In First-Out data structure. If you have a computer science background you know how a queue data structure works: the first element pushed into the queue is the first item extracted. It's basically the same concept as what we discussed in our ATM machine example.</p>
<p>A message queue is basically a queuing service used in micro services &amp; server-less architectures to decouple different components that are easier to develop, scale &amp; maintain in the long term. Message queues helps different components to communicate asynchronously by passing messages between them.</p>
<p>Generally in applications where message queues are used there are producers who create and put the messages into message queues. And there are consumers or worker processes which read those messages and take actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605504976290/uqTaa9q5A.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_4624157258.png"></p>
<p>A message is any data that is passed between two components. It contains all the information needed for the worker components to take actions.</p>
<p>Let's consider a use case where we have to recharge a customer's account. The worker component need to know these details: account_id, card_id, amount (in dollars).</p>
<p>The message the producer creates and puts into a message queues will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"card_id"</span>: <span>567</span>,
    <span>"amount"</span>: <span>100</span>
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the above message contains all the information that a worker process needs to recharge this customer's account.</p>
<p>There are many third party message queueing services like Rabbit MQ, Kafka, Amazon SQS to name a few. Each one of them provide different features suitable for different use cases.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-message-queues-used-in-a-system">How Are Message Queues Used In A System?</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier message queues are used to decouple different components in a system. But what does it mean to decouple a system? It basically means the process of separating functions so that they're more independent and self contained.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it with an example. Let's say we need an application to generate invoices and send it to our customers at the end of the month. For the sake of this discussion let's assume that generating invoices is a time taking process and take anywhere between few seconds to a minute to generate one single invoice which involves doing the below steps in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get customer account details</li>
<li>Get customer billing details</li>
<li>Get data for different products used by the customer during the month</li>
<li>Apply any onetime charges and charge customers</li>
<li>Finally generate a invoice PDF and send it to the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you implement such a functionality?</p>
<p>This is how a naive developer would approach it: Build a single REST service which accepts requests and does the above steps. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605506280058/Y03xhpEYG.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_8235631782.png"></p>
<p>This is a monolith architecture and has many problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Fault Tolerance:</strong> Fault tolerance is the ability for a system to continue operating without any interruption when one or more of its components fail. Since we have a single REST service, if the service goes down, the whole application stops working.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Components Cannot Be Scaled Independently:</strong> If we want to scale the application when the number of customers accounts increase, then we have to scale the whole application. This means more resources will be used since we cannot scale any individual component independently. So the use cases like Get Account Details will be scaled even though it is unnecessary because this components generally gets less traffic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Freedom of Language:</strong> Since all the components are built using a single application, a single language / framework need to be used to build the complete application. We cannot use different languages for different components since the whole application is a single code repository which is built and deployed together.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Development and Deployment Time:</strong> Having all the components as one single codebase will increase the development time. Since this is a big application, it's possible that different teams would be working on different components of the system at any point in time. So all the teams need to take care of code consistency, code quality and also have to spend time in resolving merge conflicts since active development will be going on. This adds to the development time. Also with bigger codebase it takes more time to build and deploy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen above there are many problems if we go with a monolith architecture for the given problem statement. We need to divide the application into multiple components like Invoice Generation Service, Invoice Generation Service Worker, Account Service, PDF Generation Service etc.</p>
<p>Let's see how diving this into multiple services &amp; having a message queue to communicate between them will solve these problems.</p>

<h3 id="what-problems-do-message-queues-solve">What Problems Do Message Queues Solve?</h3>
<p>With micro services architecture, the architecture would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605508126047/PhUZ4K-mV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_2135728654.png"></p>
<p>In this architecture the Invoice Generation Service will create a message for every customer account. This message would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"invoice_start_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-01"</span>,
    <span>"invoice_end_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-31"</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Therefore if we have 1000 accounts there will be 1000 messages pushed into the queue. The worker service will contain multiple workers. Each worker will pickup a message and start processing it. All the workers will be running concurrently. Each of these workers will talk to Account Service, Billing Service and PDF Generation Services which are micro services themselves.</p>
<p>Now let's see how each of the problems mentioned above will be solved with this architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> Fault Tolerance</strong>: If one of the component fails the other will work seamlessly. Let's say if Invoice Generation Service Worker is down for reasons, Invoice Generation Service will continue to work and keep pushing messages into the queue. It is not dependent on whether Worker service is up or not. If Invoice Generation Service is down, Worker service will continue to pull the messages from the queue and continue to generate invoices. So now there is fault tolerance in the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Now since the components are independent of one another they can be scaled independently too. All the heavy weight work is being done by the Worker service and Invoice Generation Service is just creating and pushing the messages into the message queue. So we need more computing power for the Worker service. So we can have powerful machines to run Worker service and we can add more tasks if the number of accounts increase in the future. Whereas the Invoice Generation Service can be run on less powerful machines. With this architecture we're able to scale the different components independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Language:</strong> Having multiple components like this will give us the freedom to implement different components in different programming languages and frameworks. For example: Invoice Generation Service can be implemented in Java. Worker can be implemented in GoLang.
And if let's say we have another service which is responsible for generating invoice pdf, this can be implemented in Python. So having multiple components like this and having a message queue for communication between them will give us the flexibility over languages used in the architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Developer Productivity &amp; Deployment Time:</strong> Since different components can be developed independently, the developer productivity will increase since they don't have to spend more time in co-ordinating when adding new features, resolving merge conflicts etc. Also the codebase of each of the component or service will be lighter and will have a separate deployment pipeline. So the quality, build and deployment time will decrease.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-properties-of-message-queues">Other Properties Of Message Queues</h3>
<p>Different message queuing services offer different message queues with properties like visibility timeout, message retention period, message size etc based on the popular use cases in the industry.</p>
<p>AWS provided message queuing service is called SQS (Simple Queue Service).</p>
<p>Let's discuss about SQS provided message queues and their properties in this section which gives you an idea on the different types of properties available with message queues in general.</p>
<p>AWS SQS offers two types of message queues:</p>
<h4 id="standard-queue">Standard Queue:</h4>
<p>Amazon SQS offers standard as the default queue type. Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order. Standard queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they're sent.</p>
<h4 id="fifo-queue">FIFO Queue:</h4>
<p>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, …</p></div></div>

Apart from a tenuous and vague “phase one” trade deal, any kind of truce in the ongoing China-U.S. trade war seems distant. And without a resolution in the next few weeks, nearly all goods traded between the U.S. and China will have tariffs by December 15.</span></p><p id="viewer-adua0"><span>Is it any wonder why many manufacturers are now considering leaving China, while others are accelerating earlier plans to exit.</span></p><p id="viewer-drn2j"><span>Manufacturing in India stands out as a cost-effective alternative to China. Companies like Hasbro have announced plans to limit their number of China-made products to half, choosing to relocate much of their production to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-3clqd"><span>And Taiwanese Foxconn, which manufacturers Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo, built their first plant in India in 2015 and plans to expand operations there.</span></p><p id="viewer-5a9o5"><span>But many other companies are either looking for solutions outside India or prefer to remain in China.

Meanwhile, China exported goods valued at nearly eight times as much. China’s top exports included products such as electrical machinery, appliances and equipment. While raw materials and products requiring less sophisticated manufacturing composed the majority of India’s exports.</span></p><p id="viewer-f2041"><span><strong>Mineral products, chemical products and precious metals and stones</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-9sv1v"><span>India’s top exports are dominated by mineral products (16 percent), chemical products (14 percent) and precious metals (12 percent). Mineral products include mineral fuels and oils, such as Manufacturing in India vs. Chinapetroleum.</span></p><p id="viewer-4t78m"><span>Chemical products include various organic and inorganic chemicals, soaps, tanning dyes, fertilizers, explosives and, most notably, pharmaceuticals.

Overall textiles exports were valued at $39 billion in 2018 and are expected to more than double by 2021.</span></p><p id="viewer-9shou"><span>Part of the growth comes from various government initiatives, such as a 2018 increase in basic customs duties from 10 percent to 20 percent on more than 500 textile products. Another contributor is India’s robust production of relevant input materials, such as cotton, which lend supply chain and cost advantages.</span></p><p id="viewer-faukb"><span>These exports include knitted, woven and crocheted textiles and apparel, carpets and textile floor coverings and man-made filaments.</span></p><p id="viewer-7r4hg"><span>Despite China’s current dominance in export value, India’s government is making serious efforts to invest in the country’s manufacturing sector.

    <h3 id="are-we-living-in-a-simulation"><strong>Are we living in a simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>With the evident success of computer technologies 
this question raises more and more frequently.</p>

<p>Tech people mostly agree that this is a possible scenario, 
it could even be that we live in a multiple layers of simulations -
a simulation that runs in another simulation and so on.</p>

<p>While there is probably no way to disprove this hypothesis 
I argue that believing in such thing has a negative psychological effect 
on an individual and a society in general.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-simulation"><strong>What do we mean by simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>In a process of simulation we are trying to model and imitate some real phenomena with the purpose of predicting or imposing the future outcomes. An imitation is generally much cheaper to perform than a real process. So we can trial a lot of different scenarios to find the best strategy before implementing it in reality.</p>

<p>It can be a computer modeling of a physical process or experiment. A repetition of some upcoming performance. Or even a thought process when we try to imagine a tree of possible events and our possible responses.</p>

<p>Virtual reality or a computer game also can be considered as a simulation since we model some elements of our real world (with some fictional elements, though) in a controllable and cheaper environment.</p>

<p>In general, all simulations are irrelevant when the best strategy is found.</p>

<p>But observe that in any case simulation is still part of the reality. Every completed game, no matter how useless it was, is still part of our world. And due to the butterfly effect every tiny event can have a huge impact in the future.</p>

<p>So, a simulation is always real, even if it predates the <em>real action</em>. It’s just way less important.</p>

<h3 id="why-would-we-prefer-to-think-that-we-live-in-a-less-important-world"><strong>Why would we prefer to think that we live in a less important world?</strong></h3>

<p>The simple answer is — people tend to downgrade what they see if they don’t like that. An irresponsible and childish person became a president of a powerful country? A girl has to tell to world leaders what to do with the Earth’s climate? No, this doesn’t imply that we live in some kind of game, or a part of a show. There are explanations and they are real. We just don’t know or understand them.</p>

<p>Another reason could be that the world became so big and interconnected that we feel ourselves in much less control. There are too many information, too many factors, too many actors. Also the pace of change is not making us more certain about the future. The world is less predictable than ever today.</p>

<p>Finally, downgrading reality is a psychological way to flee from our responsibilities in life. Why bother to do something if everything is not important?</p>

<h3 id="the-effects-of-such-belief"><strong>The effects of such belief</strong></h3>

<p>Believing that the world is just a simulation implies that we, our feelings and our actions are not that important either.</p>

<p>The is a huge amplifier of depression if a person has already lost their sense and purpose in life. Or this could be an excuse to live a meaningless life.</p>

<p>Now imagine that you live in a society that think the world around is not that important, including you, obviously. 
You could be an NPC (non-player character) in this game, after all. Just an AI script written by a programmer from the <em>true world</em>. Would you like to live in such community?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>

<p>Do not downgrade <em>the reality</em> of what you see simply because you don’t like it, don’t understand or don’t control it. All your actions, your feelings, your views and your life in general are <em>matter</em>, as well as the life of others.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a <a href="https://ii.umich.edu/cjs/history-of-cjs.html">graduate of the University of Michigan</a> who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>

This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/privacy-concerns-emerge-following-apple-ocsp-server-outage/">Following privacy concerns from Mac users after Apple’s Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server went down, </a>thus causing third-party applications unable to open on Macs, Apple has now responded to the situation,&nbsp; exacerbated by a recent blog post by Jeffrey Paul.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>An Apple spokesperson told<em> iPhone in Canada</em> it had updated its support document, ‘Safely open apps on your Mac’, to now further detail its privacy protections.</p>
<p>“Gatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">explains</a> Apple. “We have never&nbsp;combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are&nbsp;launching or running on their devices,” clarified the company.</p>
<p>“Notarization checks if the app contains known malware using an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures,” says Apple, further emphasizing, “These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses&nbsp;associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs,” details Apple.</p>
<p>On top of this, Apple says “over the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks,” specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>
<li>strong protections against server failure</li>
<li>a new preference for users to opt out of these security protections</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple also gave some further technical information on the situation to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em> Certificate revocation checks occur to verify that Developer ID certificates used to sign an app have not been revoked by the company. The move is critical for security since a certificate may be pulled if a developer suspects it has been compromised by third parties, or is being used to sign malicious apps.</p>
<p>The industry-standard online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is used by macOS to verify that the Developer ID code signing certificate issued to an app developer has not been revoked. This OCSP request does not include the Apple ID of the user, or reveal a device or app being launched.</p>
<p>Apple says since OCSP is used to check other certificates, including those used to encrypted web connections, these requests happen over unencrypted HTTP, as normal throughout the industry.</p>
<p>HTTP is used to prevent&nbsp;situations where verifying the validity of the certificate that secures the connection to an OCSP server would potentially depend on the result of a request to that same&nbsp;OCSP server, creating a loop that would make it impossible to resolve the request, according to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple says on macOS Catalina and later, by default, all apps running are notarized by the company to note they have been checked by Apple for known malicious software. When an app launches, macOS will check to verify that the app has not been labeled as malicious by Apple since it was first notarized. These checks happen over an encrypted connection—and are resilient to server failures. Which is what happened the other day and users saw their apps hang and take forever to launch.</p>
<p>What caused the OCSP server problem? Apple says it was due to a server-side misconfiguration that specifically interfered with macOS being able to cache OCSP responses for Developer ID. This configuration error, along with an unrelated content delivery network (CDN) misconfiguration, is what caused the slow performance for apps to launch.</p>
<p>Apple explained to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it has already fixed this performance issue through a server-side update, that will now allow macOS to cache Developer ID OCSP checks for a longer period. macOS users do not need to do anything to benefit from this Apple update.</p>
<p>App notarization checks are used to verify that apps being launched in macOS have not been found to be malicious by Apple, since they were first notarized. Apple says these checks take place over an encrypted connection and are immune to server failures. Notarization checks were not affected by the server-side issue that caused OCSP requests to fail.</p>

<p>Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technology enables aircraft to&nbsp;determine their position via satellite and periodically broadcast this location information. An ADS-B receiver system can be used to decode this broadcast signal to track airplanes. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png" alt="" width="473" height="266" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>The ADS-B System</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various components of an ADS-B station, why they matter, and how to make improvements. </p>



<h2><strong>ADS-B Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/10/21/the-best-ads-b-receiver-for-2020-2021/">this article we previously discussed the different ADS-B receivers</a> on the market today. Systems like the one from <a href="https://amzn.to/36E08h1">Garmin</a> are completely closed and fully integrated and there’s not much opportunity to understand how they work or improve them. The best you can do is use them as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and that should result in the best performance for this product.</p>







<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from open systems based on  either the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> or the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kzQa59">Stratux ADS-B receivers</a>. </p>







<p>Both these systems use <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as foundational building blocks. There’s a wealth of information online on the internal architecture and various experiments conducted on these products to understand their specifications, performance and how best to use them. There’s also a large online community to learn from and contribute to. </p>



<h2>How Much ADS-B Signal Do You Really Need?</h2>



<p>In general when a receiver processes signals, there is a range of optimal signal level over which it performs best. Anything lower will result in performance degradation – in other words, you will see fewer airplanes. Anything greater will have the same effect. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png" alt="" width="495" height="327" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-300x198.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-768x508.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><figcaption>Different ADS-B Signal Ranges </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the very extreme, signal levels higher than a certain level will damage the ADS-B receiver. The trick then is to optimize the signal level such that you can get to within the sweet spot of the ADS-B receiver. </p>



<h2><strong>A Note on Measuring Signals </strong></h2>



<p>In general, it is very difficult to predict actual wireless signal strengths received without making a measurement. Typically a spectrum analyzer is used to make signal measurements at any given frequency. However, not everyone can afford a spectrum analyzer or has access to one. Fortunately it is possible to use an application like SDR# with your receiver to determine how strong or weak various received signals actually are and the impact they might be having on performance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of signal measurement with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as viewed in SDR#. The two views shown are the FFT view and the waterfall or spectrogram below it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before.jpg 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>FM signals measured with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you experiment with different antennas and other components below, tune across the frequency range of <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> to check out various signals and their strengths in the waterfall view. This will give you an idea of how your changes impact performance. It will for instance tell you approximately how much gain you need to add up front. It will also tell you if you actually need any amplification at all. In general avoid doing anything that increases the <strong><span>RED</span></strong> levels as these are very strong signals. </p>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various parts of the ADS-B system and how they impact performance.</p>



<h2>Antennas</h2>



<p>The antenna is at the very front-end of your ADS-B system. You will need an effective <a href="https://amzn.to/3cyPXNr">antenna for ADS-B</a> as it is key to good signal reception. As is often said, garbage in, garbage out. If you use a lousy antenna, a good receiver isn’t going to compensate for it. You can read our complete <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/04/19/best-antennas-for-ads-b-reception/">review of ADS-B antennas</a>. The best antenna requires some effort for installation and optimization but it’s well worth the time spent. </p>



<h2>RF Cables</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to mount your antenna on your rooftop or on a tower for better reception, you will need to take the length of the RF cable from the antenna to your ADS-B receiver into consideration. Why is that?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"><figcaption>Installing an Antenna on your Rooftop</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the frequency of the signal increases, so do the signal losses or attenuation due to any given length of cable. For instance, if you were to use <a href="https://amzn.to/36DJJcj">LMR-400 cable</a>, the loss at 30 MHz is only 0.7 dB for every 100 ft of cable. For the same length of cable, the loss at 1090 MHz is around 4 dB. This signal loss directly impacts the sensitivity of the system by 4 dB and therefore reduces the range of your ADS-B receiver by more than half relative to if you were to use a very short length of cable. That is quite significant.</p>



<h2>Amplifiers</h2>



<p>Fortunately there is a way to compensate for this degradation in sensitivity due to cable loss. It involves the use of a low noise amplifier (LNA). In general, any LNA with sufficiently low noise figure (typically less than 1 dB) and the required amount of gain can be used. </p>



<p>So the first question is – what is the required gain? </p>



<p>The answer depends on several factors some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Amount of cable loss at 1090 MHz</li><li>Other RF signals are present in your environment – in particular strong ones</li><li>The dynamic and operating range of your ADS-B receiver</li></ul>



<p>As discussed, cable loss can be overcome with the use of an LNA. However, an LNA will amplify everything within its range of operation. It will amplify AM, FM and other signals. Consider a situation where an FM signal is stronger than the ADS-B signal of interest. The amplified signal will saturate the receiver if it exceeds the dynamic range. The signal will also possibly damage the receiver if you’re operating at signal levels that exceed the range of the receiver. The receiver will not be able to process the ADS-B signal of interest in either case.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png" alt="Block diagram showing ADS-B signal amplified" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Amplifying an ADS-B signal</figcaption></figure>



<p>A solution to this problem is to use a Filtered LNA. This is an LNA with a filter integrated along with it as shown in the picture below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png" alt="Filtered LNA for ADS-B" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Filtered Low Noise Amplifier for ADS-B</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LNA is usually the first component and it is followed by a filter specific to the band of interest – in this case 1090 MHz for ADS-B. This product will reject all signals outside the ADS-B frequency range. For instance it will reject strong FM signals, 4G signals from cellular base stations, signals at 2.4 GHz from your Wi-Fi access point and more. </p>



<p>Here are a couple of ADS-B filtered LNAs that will work depending on your setup.</p>







<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-dual-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-30-db-gain">this Filtered LNA with 30 dB gain</a> if you have a very long cable run and need to compensate for significant signal loss. Using the calculation for LMR400 above, this Filtered LNA can compensate for 700 ft of cable loss. </p>



<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-15-db-gain">this Filtered LNA that provides 15 dB gain</a>, if you have a shorter cable run. </p>



<h3><strong>How to Install an LNA</strong></h3>



<p>It is best to place the LNA very close to the antenna. This will help minimize the noise figure and improve the sensitivity of your ADS-B receiver system. Since it’s difficult to get a power source or supply at the top of an antenna, <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/01/19/what-is-a-bias-tee/">a bias tee system</a> can be used. A bias tee at the receiver is used to send the DC voltage up to the LNA over the RF cable connecting the two. At the LNA there is a reciprocal bias tee that splits the DC and RF signals. The DC is used to power the LNA. The block diagram below shows a situation where the SDR has a built-in bias tee. This is indeed the case with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Use a Bias Tee to Power a Remote LNA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes when an LNA is connected the results look like in the following picture – amazing results with a tripling of the number of planes observed!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg 940w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption>Improvement in Number of Planes Tracked</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At other times, the addition of an LNA degrades performance and you will not be able to see any airplanes. Why does this happen? Let’s assume that your LNA is connected properly with the RF input end connected to the antenna and that it is powered correctly. There are then two possibilities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Too much cable loss</strong> and the amount of LNA gain cannot help overcome this degradation. In this situation more gain is required and you can simply add another LNA. Remember to place the first LNA as close to the antenna as possible so as to minimize noise figure. Remember also to check signal levels so you can adjust the amplitude to be within the optimal range. </li><li><strong>Too much gain </strong>and you are likely saturating your receiver with strong signals. Note that even when using a filtered LNA, if the FM signals in your area are very strong, the out-of-band attenuation due to the filter might not be adequate to prevent receiver saturation. Once again you can check what’s going on with the spectrum analyzer view in SDR#. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>How to Optimize the Signal Levels into the RTL-SDR</strong></h3>



<p>There are three methods by which you can optimize signal levels going into the RTL-SDR after the addition of a Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>In the event that you have strong out-of-band signals, they should be attenuated to a reasonable level. The easiest way to do this is by adding an additional <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/ads-b-bandpass-filter-band-pass-1090-mhz-ads-b/">ADS-B bandpass filter</a> after the Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>Another way to optimize gain is to reduce the signal level across the band with an attenuator. Connect <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4a4IY">an inline fixed attenuator</a> to the output of the LNA. You can experiment with different values such as 30 dB, 20 dB, etc. until you start seeing output by way of planes. </p>







<p>The third method is to adjust the gain in the Flightaware stick digitally. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> stick is essentially an <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">RTL-SDR</a> and utilizes an R802T chipset. Below is a block diagram of the R802T.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-300x202.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-768x517.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>R802T Architecture</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see the user has the ability to modify the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The range over which this can be varied is nearly 50 dB. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> powers up with maximum amplification in the system. So you essentially have to adjust it to a point where you get the best reception. <a href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/for-beginners-how-to-set-change-gain/30201">Here are instructions on how to modify the gain</a>. </p>



<p>Many experiments have been conducted and reported on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> discussion site. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/gain-adjustment/18376/7" target="_blank">Here is one such discussion</a>. In the plot below, user BartJr has reported an improvement in reception with increase in amplification.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In his video message on his prayer intention for November, Pope Francis emphasizes that progress in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) be oriented “towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation”.</p><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><b><i>By Vatican News staff writer</i></b></p> 
<p>During the month of November, Pope Francis draws our attention to the epochal change that humanity is experiencing thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. &nbsp;He, therefore, invites us to pray that this progress always “serve humankind,” respecting human dignity and taking care of Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>True progress</b></h2> 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made exponential advances, as evidenced by its many applications in different fields of knowledge. Today, 37% of organizations in the world have implemented AI in some way (which represents a 270% increase in the past four years).</p> 
<p>In “<a href="https://thepopevideo.org/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">The Pope Video</a>” this month, Pope Francis clarifies that this progress in robotics and AI “can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.” &nbsp;In this sense, he hopes for technological progress that does not increase the inequalities in society.&nbsp; If it does, the Pope says, it will not be “true progress”.&nbsp; Such progress does not take into account the dignity of the human person and care for Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>Benefits</b></h2> 
<p>AI is capable of addressing many problems facing humanity, such as in evaluating the learning capacity of students, in order to detect opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; It can help people with visual or hearing impairments by developing better communication tools (such as converting text to speech or speech to text).&nbsp; AI can also speed up the collection, processing and diffusion of health data to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, especially those living in remote areas.</p> 
<p>The same applies to the field of ecology. Through AI, it is possible to analyze data on climate change and create models that can help predict natural disasters. It can also be used to create intelligent and sustainable cities by reducing urban spending, improving the resilience of highways and increasing energy efficiency.&nbsp; There are vast possibilities for using this technological progress for the common good, and “The Pope Video” uses images from the Italian Institute of Technology and the Italian multinational energy company, Enel, to show some of these benefits.</p> 
<h2><b>Serving humanity&nbsp;</b></h2> 
<p>“Innovation,” says Enel’s CEO, Francesco Starace, “has placed at our disposition extraordinary tools that we need to be capable of using in the best possible way.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He continues, “As Pope Francis reaffirms, it is our task to ensure that the resulting benefits are distributed fairly and create opportunities and wellbeing.” Starace says, “In order to give a positive orientation to our actions and choices regarding the present and the future, we must put respect for people and for the environment at the centre, adopting a vision based on sustainability. Only in this way can technological evolution be an ally of humanity and create opportunities which, up until a few years ago, we couldn’t even imagine.”</p> 
<p>The Pope’s <a href="https://www.popesprayer.va/" rel="external">Worldwide Prayer Network</a> is responsible for the diffusion of the Pope’s monthly prayer intentions. &nbsp;In comments on the Holy Father’s prayer intention for November, the network’s international director, Jesuit Father Frédéric Fornos also speaks of the need to channel these rapid technological changes for the “good of all.”</p> 
<p>“This month’s prayer intention,” he says, “reinforces the idea that the benefit that humanity has obtained (and will continue to obtain) from technological progress must always take into account as well, and in parallel, ‘adequate development of responsibility and values’.”&nbsp; This, Fr Fornos says, has been underscored by the Pope in his encyclical <i>Laudato si’ </i>and now in his third encyclical, <i>Fratelli tutti,</i> where he says, “How wonderful it would be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation could come with more equality and social inclusion!”</p> 
<p>AI, robotics, and other applications of technology, says Fr Fornos, open great challenges for ethics and social justice. “This is why the Pope’s most recent petition is important: to pray that this progress will always ‘be human.’”</p> 
<p><b>The text of the November 2020 prayer intention:</b></p> 
<p><i>Artificial intelligence is at the heart of the epochal change we are experiencing.&nbsp; Robotics can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.&nbsp; Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not true progress.&nbsp; Future advances should be oriented towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation.&nbsp;</i></p> 
<p><i>Let us pray that the progress of robotics and artificial intelligence may always serve humankind… we could say, may it “be human.”</i><br> </p></div></div>]]>

        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3>Getting Things Done</h3><p><time datetime="2020-11-09"><small>9 Nov, 2020</small></time></p><p>I'm writing this blog post at 21:45 on a weekday after an intense day at work and a full evening of looking after my daughter and cooking pizza. I was in three video conferences and chatted with two colleagues in Teams, all while having my kid run around me all day because the daycare is closed. Now's the time to do something for <strong>me</strong>. Wouldn't it be nice to have some help to juggle all these different things and not feel overwhelmed?</p><p>In the next weeks, I'm trying out the Getting Things Done (GTD for short) method. I have tried GTD for short periods off and on over some years. Without knowing the concept, I used <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things">Things</a> but abandoned it after some time. That was over 10 years in my studies. A few years back, I read the original book and re-read it last year. So why try again? Didn't I learn my lesson?</p><p>No - I didn't :-). Although I've never completely adopted it, I've soaked up more and more of its practices. This time around I'll try to apply <em>all</em> its techniques as well as I can and see where that leads me.</p><h2 id="gtd-in-a-nutshell">GTD in a nutshell</h2><p>Quoted with small changes from the book:</p><ol><li>Capture all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you - now, later, someday, big little, or in between -- in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind.</li><li>Direct yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the "inputs" you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment.</li><li>Curate and coordinate all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play at any point in time.</li></ol><p>There are already many concise and complete introductions to the basics of GTD, so I won't repeat them here. Read <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">Erlend Hamberg's well-structured one: GTD in 15 minutes</a>. It's a quick and well-written guide.</p><p>In a sense, GTD is very American because I have the feeling (North) Americans are obsessed with lists. Many clickbait articles you come across have titles like "top X things" where X is more often than not simply the number somebody came up with. Although I must admit the last example was from a German site <a href="https://t3n.de/news/wordpress-hosting-anbieter-vergleich-604474/">13 WordPress-Anbieter</a>.</p><p>GTD has a list of the next actions one wants to look at. This is different from a todo list in that there are stricter rules on what a good entry can be. For example, it has to be a physical action and not a whole project. GTD also prescribes reviews (every day and every week) to keep on top of these lists. There's a comfort to know you'll triage a pressing question or inspiring article the next day or at least at your weekly review. This relief is at the heart of GTD: knowing that nothing will fall through the cracks you can relax from time to time.</p><p>One pays for a generally more relaxed general outlook by following a couple of small practices very closely. To capture all things, David Allen means that all emails or collected snippets are processed and collected too. I found it especially significant that one should collect references and notes on everything that might come in handy later. Collecting things comes <strong>very</strong> naturally to me; as a kid, I liked to collect buttons -- of all things -- and to keep many books around. When at long last I got my own computer I immediately started collecting <em>all the things</em>. My <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> accounts probably had more than a thousand collected links when it was shut down. GTD emphasizes to collect references for later usage. A lot of input is not useful at the moment and only potentially later at some point, but still, you can rely on your system to keep it for you.</p><h2 id="is-gtd-for-everybody%3F">Is GTD for everybody?</h2><p>David Allen originally "discovered" it in his work as a consultant and executive coach. I would argue that it's useful when you're already pretty organized. If you're in a routine job with little need for interaction with others it might be overkill for you. A simple todo list and some basic tricks to fight procrastination could be enough. There are fewer and fewer routine jobs. Most office workers are expected to be as "agile" when shifting many responsibilities as executives two decades ago.</p><h2 id="besides-gtd">Besides GTD</h2><p>In summary, I've mentioned that a convenient "setup" serves me better than vague "hacks". It can increase motivation and/or remove distractions. For my productivity, I still find it crucial to avoid news sites as much as possible. I've replaced them with a collection of RSS feeds from newspapers and some blogs. With a configured update interval of four hours, refreshing it every few minutes is less attractive. Turning off communication tools, the popular Pomodoro technique or simply walking to another room, still help me. I like that you can still apply many other ideas and still refine my <em>personal</em> system. If I had <strong>nothing</strong> to procrastinate on, that would be sad too, right?</p><p>I think getting rid of distractions is more important than having the perfect productivity system/todo tool. Cal Newport's ideas from his books (especially <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">"Deep Work"</a> and <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/">"Digital Minimalism"</a>) and his <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/">blog</a> immediately come to mind. <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/everyday-systems/">Here are some ideas from developer Tania Rascia</a> that I can relate to.</p><h2 id="how-to-implement-gtd">How to Implement GTD</h2><p>You have to decide if you want to go analog or digital. David Allen suggests in his book to keep lists and folders analog first. Digital tools realize GTD with more or less sophistication. I've never tried to use only paper although I tried working a lot with my Moleskine notebook. At some point, I had also used Things but only used it as a fancy todo list.</p><p>For me a very text-centric simple note-taking app called <a href="https://nvultra.com/">nvUltra</a> has worked well. It lets me write lists in different files synced between my laptop and smartphone. It's not very adapted to GTD but I like that it is an excellent reference system too. nvUltra is the commercial successor to the excellent open-source <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a>. This in turn evolved from <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>. There are also cross-platform implementations such as <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">nvPY</a>.</p><p><a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done">todoist</a> is a sophisticated tool for GTD too. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> has been around very long and has been refreshed over time. Other general-purpose note-taking tools can be adapted for GTD too, such as Evernote, Notion, or OneNote. <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is an alternative plain text file format that's more powerful than Markdown. It's mostly used with the Emacs editor and supports notes and todos as well.</p><h2 id="gtd-horizons">GTD horizons</h2><p>One distinguishing feature of GTD on top of todo management is more abstract and longer-term levels of focus. rom the day-to-day "ground" level, David Allen introduces the level of longer projects at horizon 1 and goes up to the purpose of your life with horizon 5. In his <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2015/05/podcast-01-david-allen-talks-about-the-new-edition-of-getting-things-done/">podcast</a>, David Allen mentions that for many it takes years to reach these longer-term perspectives. It takes a long time to integrate them into the system. He suggests one should start off with the day-to-day and form long-term plans bottom-up.</p><p>GTD horizons with their increased abstraction remind me of Eastern religions such as buddhism. In stoicism as well one works towards a very distant ideal of "enlightenment". This is not far-fetched as David Allen is a black belt karateka and used his experience in the conception of GTD. The book mentions having a "mind like water" to be ready for anything that may come to you as a concept from martial arts. There's also a blog by David Allen with <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2019/05/10-reasons-gtd-is-like-karate/">10 more similarities</a>.</p><h2 id="is-it-simply-self-exploitation%3F">Is it Simply Self-Exploitation?</h2><p>"Increasing productivity" also has a stale 19th century factory worker exploitation aspect to me. At least the basis of management "science" had very questionable origins. Managers "scientifically" noted how long some workers took to complete a task. They noted the fastest and decided to increase work quotas for everybody. Even then short-term exploitation didn't have long-term lasting positive effects.</p><p>One could argue that a personal productivity system only serves as self-exploitation. Where managers exploited industrial workers, we do it ourselves now. I haven't read or though much about this, but a <a href="https://dev.to/tinmanjk/the-curious-case-of-self-exploitation--303j">dev article by Ivan Petrov raises some interesting points</a>. They emphasize:</p><blockquote><p>What I have learned and forgotten and re-learned is that the power NOT to do (negative potency) seems to be the only weapon.</p></blockquote><p>This at least we can take to heart by filtering out many actions. We can also try to move away from "outside" areas of (work) focus and focus on our own values and vision.</p><h2 id="trial-period">Trial Period</h2><p>For the next month until December 6th, I'm implementing GTD and revisiting its techniques. For me some questions still remain unanswered:</p><ul><li>When to "uncover" the following project "next action"? As soon as a previous one is done? At the daily or weekly review?</li><li>Should I track project "next actions" in the same list of individual "next actions"? Wouldn't this create a lot of extra overhead to copy tasks from files to files?</li><li>Can I effectively attach project and action reference material with my bare-bones plain-text system? nvUltra doesn't have support to easily attach images or other files.</li><li>Should I keep some references available for all completed actions for later reference?</li><li>Are the tickler files something I can implement digitally? Should I use it for habits and routines?</li><li>Will I have the discipline to postpone work tasks (that often overwhelm my todo list)?</li><li>Should I copy information from other tracking tools that I use with others, e.g. JIRA?</li><li>How exactly to keep track of deadlines (with tickler files or also in projects)?</li><li>Should I handle personal or professional tasks differently after all?</li><li>What are my higher horizons like "areas of responsibility", "objectives", "vision" and "purpose"?</li></ul><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://forum.gettingthingsdone.com/">Official GTD Forum</a></li></ul><h3 id="overview%2Fintroduction">Overview/Introduction</h3><ul><li><a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">GTD in 15 minutes</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done</a></li><li><a href="https://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">Merlin Mann's Intro with further links</a></li></ul><h3 id="references-2">References</h3><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190602235428/http://wiki.43folders.com:80/index.php/GTD">Merlin Mann's wiki via Wayback Machine</a></li></ul><h3 id="scientific-evaluation">Scientific Evaluation</h3><ul><li><a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GTD-cognition.pdf">"Getting Things Done: The Science behind Stress-Free Productivity"</a></li></ul></article></div>]]>

  <blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bezos. I’m all in favor of a clean fulfillment center, but tell me: Why do you sweep? Why do you not instead eliminate the source of dirt? - Unknown “insultant”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does DevOps pass the “so what?” test? When you start to follow the history of DevOps from Agile, Lean, TOS, TQM, TPS, and beyond; doesn’t it lead to plain old critical thinking? Is it anything special? If it’s so simple, if anyone can do it, then why on earth would the worlds richest person <a href="https://youtu.be/O4MtQGRIIuA?t=1250">pay an “insultant” to teach him</a>? Jeff seems to understand that eliminating waste is important, that you should never pass a defect down the line, but he seems to discard the sweeping question as too abstract, and not useful.</p>
<p>Las Cruces Public Schools (LCPS) may be a perfect example of an organization that’s proud of their ability to <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/education/lcps/2020/11/14/las-cruces-public-schools-what-ransomware-attack-taught-us/6296955002/">scale up sweeping operations in response to a ransomware incident</a>. Why are they so proud of their investment of resources, to deal with ransomware? <a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">How does that support their mission</a>? Who’s their customer? Ransomware? If DevOps is just critical thinking and LCPS’ value statement is “<a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">our expectation is that our schools are diverse, equitable, and provide opportunities for the development of critical thinking and democratic ideals</a>”, then shouldn’t we hold them accountable for critical thinking?</p>
<p>Nobody gravitates towards DevOps when everything is working. DevOps isn’t valuable in environments where waste is cheap, it’s valuable where waste isn’t cheap. I’d have to think it’s valuable in any public school system that’s struggling to meet demand within their budget. Maybe it’s too late to help LCPS avoid ransomware, but maybe we can help another school system through a little critical thinking exercise.</p>
<p>Most of what people assume is “DevOps” is just repackaged teaching from an Isreali physicist who wrote a book for the business world in 1984. That book, The Goal, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2012/06/the-goal-eli-goldratts-gripping-thriller-about-operations-theory.html">is still popular in business schools</a>. If there’s one thing Eliyahu Goldratt, the author of The Goal, consistently talks about in all of his teaching, it’s understanding cause and effect. Goldratt advocates for the use of what he calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_reality_tree_(theory_of_constraints)">Current Reality Tree</a> (CRT) to map out the cause and effect of a problem, the conflict, and where to focus resources on resolution.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out with Ransomware, it may look something like this if we simply map out the cause and effect relationships of what we know about a <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">ransomware incident</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-1.png" alt="simple cause and effect"></p>
<p>Make sense? Now let’s look at a full current reality tree, where we go beyond the ransomware incident, and start to look at how a ransomware opportunity was created.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png" alt="full crt">
<a href="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png">Full Image</a></p>
<p>It balloons out when we start to understand all the vectors of how they get on our network, and what they do, once they get there.</p>
<p>Vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">Phishing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/business-security-world/2018/08/protect-rdp-access-ransomware-attacks/">Perimeter System: Compromised Credentials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/black-kingdom-ransomware-hacks-networks-with-pulse-vpn-flaws/">Perimeter System: Missing Patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once they get on the network they’ll deploy a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/24/cobalt_strike_cisco_talos/">command and control</a> (C&amp;C) tool that enables them to drop additional tools and start hunting domain admins. They’ll search for servers or computers <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound">where they can login, and where the domain admin is logged in</a>. Once they find that system they grab either the domain admin’s password, or their session information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash">just as good as a password</a>), then it’s game over. They now have keys to the kingdom and can delete backups and encrypt systems.</p>
<p>Now that you know how it works, and the cause and effect: Did LCPS eliminate the source of dirt?</p>
<p>This is the only statement that covers what they learned, and how they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then, we have installed firewalls, updated our systems, invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure so we can protect ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we go back to our current reality tree we can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a firewall address the conflict points? It’s not clear if they’re talking about a new fancy next-gen perimeter firewall, improved network segregation, or host firewalls. Segregation and host firewalls could help if they prevent the bad actor from logging into a shared system where domain admin is logged in.</li>
<li>Was the problem updated systems? Possible vector if they’re not patching, but it doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
<li>Invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure. Great. Keep it up, but it still doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the core conflict:</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-3.png" alt="core conflict"></p>
<p>The number of domain admins is the core conflict. It’s rarely necessary to have any domain admins, but most organizations have much more than zero when it’s easier to give somebody domain admin access, than it is to take the time to give them only the access they need to do their job. Plain old Least Privilege. Plain old <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/controlled-use-of-administrative-privileges/">#4 on the CIS Top 20 security controls</a>.</p>
<p>Did LCPS go back and fix the core conflict, or are they still passing a defect downline? What should they have done prior to the Ransomware breach? What can you do now? Evaluate your blast radius. Your InfoSec and/or IT teams should be following the advice of <a href="https://adsecurity.org/">adsecurity.org</a>. They should be running tools like <a href="https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound">Plumhound</a> or <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/">Infection Monkey</a> to understand and reduce blast radius.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an IT or InfoSec expert to get a glimpse into your ransomware risk. You’re at less risk, possibly near zero, if your organization isn’t using Active Directory; but if they are, you can run the powershell below from your computer to evaluate blast radius.</p>
<pre><code># This will install AD tools on Windows 10
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
# This will list all domain admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
# This will list all enterprise admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
</code></pre>
<p>That powershell will list user accounts ransomware teams are interested in, the ones they’ll go after once they land on your network. Ideally that list is zero. It’s not zero? Shocker! How about passwords? Are they being rotated quickly? Ideally every 7 days or less. What’s the logon count look like? Is it in the hundreds? Ouch, somebody is running around with scissors.</p>
<p>Concerned? Send that output to your IT or InfoSec teams. Ask them if they understand the advice of adsecurity.org or Plumhound. Maybe they have it under control, but maybe they need a little poking to remind them it’s important.</p>
<p>Interested in learning more about the so what of DevOps, and how it applies to Information Security? I’m writing a book. Send me an <a href="https://ericalexander.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0a4a5b6afb0b3eea2afafab80a5b2a9a3a1aca5b8a1aea4a5b2eeafb2a7ffb3b5a2aaa5a3b4fda2afafabe6a1adb0fba2afa4b9fd8ca5b4e5f2f0ada5e5f2f0abaeafb7e5f2f0b7a8a5aee5f2f0a9b4e7b3e5f2f0afb5b4">email</a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericalexanderorg">LinkedIn</a> if you’re interested in the book.</p>

<p>The basic installation format for users who install packages via <code>pip</code> is
the wheel format. Wheel names are composed of four parts: a
package-name-and-version tag (which can be further broken down), a Python tag,
an ABI tag, and a platform tag. More information on the tags can be found in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425">PEP 425</a>.  So a package like NumPy
will be available on PyPI as <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl</code> for 64-bit
windows and <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code> for macOS. Note
that only the plaform tag <code>win_amd64</code> or <code>macosx_10_9_x86_64</code> differs. </p>
<p>But what about Linux? There is no single, vendor controlled, "Linux platform"
e.g., Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, Debian, FreeBSD all package software at slightly
different versions. What most Linux distributions do have in common is the
glibc runtime library, and a smattering of various additional system libraries.
So it is possible to define a least common denominator (LCD) of software
expected to be on a Linux platform (exceptions apply, e.g. non-glibc
distributions).</p>
<p>The decision to converge on a LCD common platform gave birth to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/">manylinux1</a> standard. Going back
to our example, numpy is available as
<code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl</code>.</p>
<p>The first manylinux standard, manylinux1, was based on CentOS5 which has <a href="https://endoflife.software/operating-systems/linux/centos">been
obsolete</a> since
March 2017. The subsequent manylinux2010 standard is based on CentOS6, which
will hit end-of-life in December 2020. The manylinux2014 standard still has some
breathing room. Based on CentOS7, it will reach end-of-life in July 2024.</p>
<p>So what is next for <code>manylinux</code>, and what <code>manylinux</code> should users and package
maintainers use?</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>If <code>manylinux1</code> is obsolete, why are there still manylinux1 wheels?</h3>
<p>Wheels are typically consumed by Pip via <code>pip install</code>. Manylinux wheels are
used for projects that require compilation, otherwise they would ship
pure Python wheels with the "none" platform tag, meaning they are compatible with
any platform. So say you are a library author and want to make it convenient
for users to install your package. If you ship a manylinux2014 wheel, but the
version of Pip your users have is too old to support manylinux2014 wheels, Pip
will happily download the source package and compile it for them. Havoc ensues:
Windows users typically cannot compile, prerequisites will be missing. Pip has
a <code>--only-binary</code> option to prevent it from downloading source code and
compiling, and a <code>--prefer-binary</code> option to prefer older binary packages over
compiling from source, but neither is on by default.</p>
<p>Pip began supporting manylinux2010 wheels with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/NEWS.rst#190-2019-01-22">version
19.0</a>,
released in Jan 2019. The version of Pip that is officially shipped with Python 3.6, via
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ensurepip.html">ensurepip</a> module, is
version 18. Python 3.7 ships pip 20. It is easy enough to upgrade, but to be on
the safe side, and prevent havoc, library authors will ship a manylinux1 wheel
for Python 3.6 support.</p>
<h3>What happens now that Python 3.6 is falling out of favor?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494">Python 3.6 is no longer in active
development</a>. In fact, the scientific
Python community has decided to stop actively supporting Python 3.6 <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#support-table">from
July 2020</a>.
So I would expect to see projects begin to drop the older manylinux1 format,
and drop support for Python 3.6 sooner rather than later, meaning that
<strong><code>manylinux2014</code> may soon become the only option</strong> for new versions.</p>
<h3>What about Conda packages?</h3>
<p>Conda does not use the same kind of wheel format provided by PyPI and Pip. Conda's
build system is internally consistent, and Conda packagers build a binary
package for each supported OS, thus they are not bound to the manylinux
designation. Conda does not have a declared policy around deprecating Python
3.6 yet. Conda does support <code>pip</code> (but try not to mix <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code>
usage!), and the Pip provided should be version 20 or later. If needed,
<code>conda upgrade pip</code> should get you a modern version, so here too
<code>manylinux2014</code> will soon become the only option.</p>
<h3>What comes after manylinux2014?</h3>
<p>The glibc used in manylinux2014 is defined as the one used by CentOS7. This OS
was released in June 2014. This manylinux standard, for the first time,
declared support for non-x86 hardware systems like ARM64 (aarch64), Power
(ppc64) and S390X.  However the ARM platform has grown greatly since 2014, and
glibc has moved from version 2.17 to 2.31, fixing many bugs. Since the real
driver for platform compatibility is glibc, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/">PEP
600</a> defined a "perennial manylinux
spec" that is based on the glibc version number. A lot of work has <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/542">already
taken place</a> to support the next
version. Now we need to take the dive: decide what the base OS for the next
manylinux tag will be, roll out a Docker image and tooling around it, and
convince library packaging teams to adopt it. This is needed to allow libraries
like NumPy to confidently use the glibc routines fixed after 2014. For
instance, <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15763">this issue</a> is
preventing NumPy from properly supporting <code>np.float128</code> on Power and S390X.</p>
<h3>What about non-x86 machines and Linux?</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, starting with manylinux2014 <code>pip</code> and <code>wheel</code> supports
non-x86 architectures like ARM64. Many packages are just now starting to roll
out support for these architectures, as the CI systems that support open source
projects (like TravisCI) have only recently made those platforms available.
It might be easier for users to adopt Conda and the <code>conda-forge</code> channel
since conda-forge has support for non-x86 architectures today.</p>
<h3>OK, so what is the bottom line?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use pip v20 or later to make it easier on libarary packagers: modern pip
  versions will take the latest manylinux package they can support and will be
  forward-compatible with the PEP 600 perennial manylinux standard.</li>
<li>Manylinux1 and Python 3.6 are going away. Update your systems.</li>
<li>For people looking to move PEP 600 forward, the next step is to dive into the
  <a href="https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel">auditwheel</a> repo to define and support
  the next manylinux version. </li>
</ul>

<h3>raidz vs draid<a href="#raidz-vs-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ZFS users are most likely very familiar with raidz already, so a
comparison with draid would help. The illustrations below are
simplified, but sufficient for the purpose of a comparison. For example,
31 drives can be configured as a zpool of 6 raidz1 vdevs and a hot
spare: <img alt="raidz1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_raidz.png"></p>
<p>As shown above, if drive 0 fails and is replaced by the hot spare, only
5 out of the 30 surviving drives will work to resilver: drives 1-4 read,
and drive 30 writes.</p>
<p>The same 30 drives can be configured as 1 draid1 vdev of the same level
of redundancy (i.e. single parity, 1/4 parity ratio) and single spare
capacity: <img alt="draid1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_draid.png"></p>
<p>The drives are shuffled in a way that, after drive 0 fails, all 30
surviving drives will work together to restore the lost data/parity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All 30 drives read, because unlike the raidz1 configuration shown
above, in the draid1 configuration the neighbor drives of the failed
drive 0 (i.e. drives in a same data+parity group) are not fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>All 30 drives write, because now there is no dedicated spare drive.
Instead, spare blocks come from all drives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normal application IO: draid and raidz are very similar. There’s a
slight advantage in draid, since there’s no dedicated spare drive
which is idle when not in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Restore lost data/parity: for raidz, not all surviving drives will
work to rebuild, and in addition it’s bounded by the write throughput
of a single replacement drive. For draid, the rebuild speed will
scale with the total number of drives because all surviving drives
will work to rebuild.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev must shuffle its child drives in a way that regardless of
which drive has failed, the rebuild IO (both read and write) will
distribute evenly among all surviving drives, so the rebuild speed will
scale. The exact mechanism used by the dRAID vdev driver is beyond the
scope of this simple introduction here. If interested, please refer to
the recommended readings in the next section.</p>

<h3>Recommended Reading<a href="#recommended-reading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Parity declustering (the fancy term for shuffling drives) has been an
active research topic, and many papers have been published in this area.
The <a href="http://www.cse.scu.edu/~tschwarz/TechReports/hpca.pdf">Permutation Development Data
Layout</a> is a
good paper to begin. The dRAID vdev driver uses a shuffling algorithm
loosely based on the mechanism described in this paper.</p>

<h2>Using dRAID<a href="#using-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First get the code <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/10102">here</a>,
build zfs with <em>configure –enable-debug</em>, and install. Then load the
zfs kernel module with the following options which help dRAID rebuild
performance.</p>

<h3>Create a dRAID vdev<a href="#create-a-draid-vdev" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similar to raidz vdev a dRAID vdev can be created using the
<code><span>zpool</span> <span>create</span></code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][ &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Unlike raidz, additional options may be provided as part of the
<code><span>draid</span></code> vdev type to specify an exact dRAID layout. When unspecific
reasonable defaults will be chosen.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][:&lt;groups&gt;g][:&lt;spares&gt;s][:&lt;data&gt;d][:&lt;iterations&gt;] &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>groups - Number of redundancy groups (default: 1 group per 12 vdevs)</p></li>
<li><p>spares - Number of distributed hot spares (default: 1)</p></li>
<li><p>data - Number of data devices per group (default: determined by
number of groups)</p></li>
<li><p>iterations - Number of iterations to perform generating a valid dRAID
mapping (default 3).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The default values are not set in stone and may change.</p></li>
<li><p>For the majority of common configurations we intend to provide
pre-computed balanced dRAID mappings.</p></li>
<li><p>When <em>data</em> is specified then: (draid_children - spares) % (parity +
data) == 0, otherwise the pool creation will fail.</p></li>

<p>There are two logical hot spare vdevs shown above at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The names begin with a <code><span>s&lt;id&gt;-</span></code> followed by the name of the parent
dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>These hot spares are logical, made from reserved blocks on all the 53
child drives of the dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike traditional hot spares, the distributed spare can only replace
a drive in its parent dRAID vdev.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev behaves just like a raidz vdev of the same parity level.
You can do IO to/from it, scrub it, fail a child drive and it’d operate
in degraded mode.</p>

<div id="rebuild-to-distributed-spare">
<h3>Rebuild to distributed spare<a href="#rebuild-to-distributed-spare" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When there’s a failed/offline child drive, the dRAID vdev supports a
completely new mechanism to reconstruct lost data/parity, in addition to
the resilver. First of all, resilver is still supported - if a failed
drive is replaced by another physical drive, the resilver process is
used to reconstruct lost data/parity to the new replacement drive, which
is the same as a resilver in a raidz vdev.</p>
<p>But if a child drive is replaced with a distributed spare, a new process
called rebuild is used instead of resilver:</p>

<p>The scan status line of the <em>zpool status</em> output now says <em>“rebuilt”</em>
instead of <em>“resilvered”</em>, because the lost data/parity was rebuilt to
the distributed spare by a brand new process called <em>“rebuild”</em>. The
main differences from <em>resilver</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rebuild process does not scan the whole block pointer tree.
Instead, it only scans the spacemap objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The IO from rebuild is sequential, because it rebuilds metaslabs one
by one in sequential order.</p></li>
<li><p>The rebuild process is not limited to block boundaries. For example,
if 10 64K blocks are allocated contiguously, then rebuild will fix
640K at one time. So rebuild process will generate larger IOs than
resilver.</p></li>
<li><p>For all the benefits above, there is one price to pay. The rebuild
process cannot verify block checksums, since it doesn’t have block
pointers.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the rebuild process requires support from on-disk format,
and <strong>only</strong> works on draid and mirror vdevs. Resilver, on the other
hand, works with any vdev (including draid).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although rebuild process creates larger IOs, the drives will not
necessarily see large IO requests. The block device queue parameter
<em>/sys/block/</em>/queue/max_sectors_kb* must be tuned accordingly. However,
since the rebuild IO is already sequential, the benefits of enabling
larger IO requests might be marginal.</p>
<p>At this point, redundancy has been fully restored without adding any new
drive to the pool. If another drive is offlined, the pool is still able
to do IO:</p>

				<p><h2>Small, portable laser pointers could be used to guide lightning strikes, with a study suggesting the technology may prevent bolts from sparking wildfires, a researcher told AFP Thursday.</h2></p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>A team of international scientists have shown storm clouds could be “short-circuited” by using a hollow laser — like a pipe of light — to deliver particles into the clouds and draw lightning strikes, research co-author Professor Andrey Miroshnichenko from the University of New South Wales in Canberra told AFP.</p>
<p>In lab tests, the team — which also included scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) — successfully used a laser tractor beam to direct the path of an electrical discharge to specific targets, Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>In the past, high-powered lasers were needed to achieve similar results, making the technique dangerous, costly and inaccurate.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

			</div><div>
				
				
				<div><p>But the new research suggested that small, hand-held lasers could be used in the field within the next decade, he said.</p>
<p>“It turns out that to deliver particles, you do not need high-intensity lasers, even low intensity like your laser pointer will be already enough,” Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>Using a tractor beam with a hollow centre, micro-particles in the air could be heated up and delivered to a specific point and trigger an electrical discharge.</p></div>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>Although it is yet to be tested outside a lab, the technique could potentially be used to control dry lightning strikes, infamous for sparking large blazes including several major <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/social-media-fakes-australia-bushfire-disinformation/">bushfires in Australia</a> and the western US in the past year, Miroshnichenko added.</p>
<p>“We can imagine a future where this technology may induce electrical discharge from passing lightning, helping to guide it to safe targets and reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/makeshift-hospital-saving-dozens-of-koalas-injured-in-bushfires/">catastrophic fires</a>,” co-researcher Vladlen Shvedov, from the ANU Research School of Physics, said.</p>
<p>The research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19183-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications last month</a>, also involved Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar and the University of California in Los Angeles.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

  <p><time>10 Nov 2020</time>
  </p>
  <p>Haskell’s type classes and deriving facilities are a killer feature for type safety and extensibility.
Over nearly 30 years they’ve acquired quite a bit of cruft and language extensions.
With <code>DerivingVia</code>, we now have the ability to dramatically simplify the deriving story.</p>

<p>This post outlines a change to the <em>language</em> that would hopefully be adopted with the next version of the language standard.
They get less reasonable and more dramatic as the post goes on.</p>



<p>GHC has a ton of extensions that only serve to unlock additional type classes to the “stock” deriving strategy.
<code>Derive{Functor,Foldable,Traversable,Generic,Lift,etc}</code>.
We can remove all of these extensions by folding them into the <code>stock</code> deriving strategy.</p>



<p><code>DeriveAnyClass</code> is a footgun.
It allows you to write any type class in a <code>deriving</code> clause.
It pastes in an “empty” instance, relying on <code>DefaultSignatures</code> to fill in the values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- With DeriveAnyClass:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span>

<span>-- Without:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><code>DefaultSignatures</code> is used to give a single default implementation of a type class if the underlying type matches a more restrictive constraint.
This is primarily used to provide <code>Generic</code>-based implementations with very little syntax.</p>

<p>By privileging a single default, it makes any other possible defaults less useful and less discoverable.</p>

<p>The <code>DeriveAnyClass</code> utility is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>.</p>

<p>This extension is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>, also.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- with GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</span>

<p>Now that there’s only two strategies, we can get rid of <code>DerivingStrategies</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Before</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Currently, you must write the complete type in a <code>DerivingVia</code> clause.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<span>newtype</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Y</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be cumbersome for a very large type.</p>

<pre><code>newtype App a = App (ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO)) a)
    deriving
        ( Functor
        , Applicative
        , Monad
        , MonadReader ()
        , MonadError ()
        , MonadState ()
        )
      via
        ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO))
</code></pre>

<p>It’s also annoyingly repetitive, and can lead to errors.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>-- copy/paste error</span>

    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A wildcard can be used to indicate either:</p>

<p>a. The underlying type of a <code>newtype</code>, or 
b. The type of the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<p>There are two ways to derive things: <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> and attached deriving.
Attached deriving is redundant, but convenient.
<code>StandaloneDeriving</code> is more powerful, but less convenient.
Attached deriving clauses don’t work with <code>GADTs</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The problem with the above proposal is that it carries a significant syntax cost.
The keyword <code>deriving</code> is repeated for each instance, the keyword <code>instance</code> is repeated, the <code>via _</code> clause is repeated, and the type name is repeated.
Multiple instances should be derivable with the same context.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>(</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>via</span> 
        <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this block, we define the <code>ToJSON</code> and <code>FromJSON</code> instances using the same <code>Generically</code> viatype.
We can still use <code>_</code> to refer to the type, since we know the type we’re deriving for: <code>Foo</code>.
This recovers the syntax convenience of “attached deriving.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>App</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>App</span> <span>...</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>App</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>instance</span> 
            <span>(</span> <span>Functor</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Applicative</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Monad</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadReader</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadError</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadState</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also recovers the convenience of attached deriving.
Let’s look at the main <em>point</em> - GADTs.
Otherwise we could just remove <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> (with the nice benefit/tragedy of banning orphan derived instance).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>

<span>-- old</span>
<span>deriving</span> 
    <span>instance</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>Some</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- new</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>Some</span>
    <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- generally,</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>SomeGadtType</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SomeContextOn</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>_</code> refers to the type name, without any variables applied.
So you need to apply the type variables in the instance head.
That’s a bit annoying, but maybe it’s fine</p>



<p>GHC provides a <code>newtype Stock a = Stock a</code> that hooks in to <code>DerivingVia</code> somehow.
Now we’re down to one deriving strategy.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Stock</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This “deprivileges” the <code>Stock</code> deriving classes.</p>



<p>OK, so maybe you don’t like getting rid of attached deriving.
Let’s get rid of standalone deriving instead.
We need <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orphan derived instances (shame on you)</li>
  <li>Specifying a context for GADTs and allow application of type variables</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>
    <span>deriving</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>Show</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>-- generally,</span>
            <span>(</span><span>SomeContext</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>SomeClass</span>
        <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The type variable <code>f</code> is in scope from the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/quickdudley/status/1328068260659482624">@quickdudley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nnotm/status/1327998875563683845">@nnotm</a> have correctly pointed out that you also want to be able to define instances of a class at the definition module of a class.
These are perfectly valid instances, and so we must keep <code>StandaloneDeriving</code>.</p>



<p>Alright, post is done.
These ideas are certainly controversial and Bad, but <em>man</em> wouldn’t it be nice to have a simpler story around deriving and type class instances?
The current story is so complex, and I think we can genuinely simplify Haskell-the-language by trimming some fat here.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/am_i_tom/status/1327992136151789568">@i_am_tom</a> posted a reference to the <a href="https://github.com/tysonzero/ghc-proposals/blob/concrete-class-dictionaries/proposals/0000-concrete-class-dictionaries.md">Concrete Class Dictionaries</a> GHC proposal, which subsumes a lot of this.</p>

    <p>It's November 2020. There is no cure for COVID-19. What can we do to prevent the disaster?</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at several simulations of the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>I recommend to visit website from desktop for better experience. Phone may has performance issues.</p>
    <h3>Simulation rules</h3>
    <h4>Assumptions</h4>
    <p>Desease lasts a long time: <strong>2 to 5 weeks.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30%</strong> of people develop severe symptoms. They are especially vulnerable in a case of a lack of medical care due to overwhelmed medical facilities or weak healthcare systems.</p>
    <p><strong>3%</strong> of people are destined to die. <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/3000168/pdf/3000168/COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank"> [Source]</a>. It is due to genetic and age reasons. We are assuming we can save the people through vaccination or isolation. Unfortunately as of November 2020 there are no vaccines approved for public use.</p>
    <h4>Possible states of a person</h4>
    <p><span id="guide-healty"></span> - a healthy person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-ill"></span> - a sick person. They infect other individuals in a small area around them.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-serious"></span> - a seriously sick person with severe symptoms. They die if the medical system is overloaded. We assume the healthcare system  can handle a maximum of 200 patients at a time. Also, severely ill patients move much slower than other people.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-dead"></span> - a dead person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-immunity"></span> - a recovered perso. We assume they have developed an immunity and can not get reinfected.</p>
    <h4>Modificators</h4>
    <div>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-mask"></span> - a person with mask. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/22/national/science-health/japan-masks-block-coronavirus/" target="_blank">Mask retains up to 50% of exhaled viruses</a>. Also it retains up to 40% of inhaled viruses. If both persons
            wear masks a synergy effect appears.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-screen"></span> - a person with screen. Screen additionally protects against infection.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-both"></span> - a person with screen and mask.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Let's get started</h2>
    <h3>Virus in a small virtual city</h3>
    <p>There is a virtual city with population of 2 000 people. People contact each other as usual. No measures are taken. What could go wrong? Check it.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-small-city">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-small-city" onclick="startButton('small-city', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-small-city">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-small-city" onclick="resetButton('small-city')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>At the end of simulation you will see that everyone get desease. Results may vary, but I had a disaster my first simulation. I have got up to 1500 sick people at same time andui
        600 dead people at the end. These are 75% and 30%, respectively. Each person with severe symptoms died.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people</h3>
    <p>We have not taken any measures to protect people. Obviously, we can isolate patients in hospitals. Let's be honest, complete isolation is not possible. Patients will still
        be in contact with service personnel, such as doctors, janitors, couriers. So the virus can be passed on, but it happens less likely.</p>
    <p>Let's see how this affects the spread of the virus. <strong>It is a perfect scenario!</strong> Be prepared it takes long time. I recommend to move ahead after 90th day,
        there is nothing interesting in the following days.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>Wow! In my simulation there were so few infections that medical care was enough for everyone. Over time, the number of people with immunity increased. At some point, the
        patients were in contact only with people with immunity and could not spread the virus further.</p>
    <p>My result is 70 people who died over 498 days of pandemy. Exactly 3% that are in the genetics of people. So, what is your result?</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life</h3>
    <p>Sadly, not all people observe isolation. And alas, not all sick people know that they are ill. There is no scientific work reporting how many people are asymptomatic. In my
        city one clinic said 25% of its positive tests were from people with no signs of illness. Let's take this number as a basis. <strong>25% of those infected will not show
            symptoms and will move freely around the city.</strong></p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Well, the burden on the healthcare system is still less than in the very first scenario. But a cemeteries are overcrowded again.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life. But with masks and screens</h3>
    <p>May be masks and screens will help? Of course not all people wear them. Let's say <strong>10% of people wear screens and 50% of people wear masks</strong>.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Hmm. Although the effect is small, it is there. Why masks have not worked? Actually they worked. But if you have chance of infection as 5%, 20 contacts turns it to 74%,
        that's it! How many contacts do you have in pub or in club? Do you consider you are breathing the same air with all the pub visitors?</p>
    <h3>Isolation + masks + screens + self-isolation</h3>
    <p>So, our goal is to reduce the number of contacts. It's time for self-isonation. Don't forget to build houses for everyone in our virtual city in advance.</p>
    <p>In this case we have a chance to isolate people who do not know they are ill. One more modification in this simulation is prevention of infection through the walls.</p>
    <p>I live in Russia. So I will draw on the experience of my country. The Moscow mayor's office has obliged business to send <strong>30% of employee to work from home</strong>.
        Let's check what happens when this order is respected.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-selfisolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-selfisolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>This set of measures has shown maximum efficiency. About 70% of people did not even get infected by the end of the simulation.</p>
    <p>This is most effective step in fight with epidemy. </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3% of people are destined to die due to their genetics</li>
        <li>30% of people need medical attention due to their genetics</li>
        <li>there is NO cure for the virus.</li>
        <li>Virus control is about probabilities</li>
        <li>We must reduce human contact to reduce the probability of infection</li>
        <li>Forced contacts should be protected with masks, screens, antiseptics.</li>
    </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>It’s time for the holidays and what better way to share love and memories with your family than to create an old-school, vintage movie? You don’t need a time-machine to go back to the 50s or 60s to rmake your homevideo look like a vintage movie. All you need is FFmpeg, some imagination, and perhaps the rest of this guide 🙂 </strong></p>



<p>Let’s take a look at how you can use FFmpeg to make your videos look like old-school/vintage/retro-styled movies, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What’s Do I Mean By A Vintage Movie?</h2>



<p>Well, good question! </p>



<p><strong>My definition of an old-school movie is a movie with a low frame-rate (like 15 fps), lots of scratches and film-grain to give an aged look, and a sepia tint to it!</strong></p>



<p>Let’s see how we can achieve all of this using FFmpeg.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I shall be using the “Touchdown Pass” sequence from <a href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiph</a> to illustrate the steps. It’s a 20 second video, but for the sake of this tutorial, I’ll be cutting it to 10 seconds using FFmpeg (<a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/">here’s how to do that</a>).</p>



<p>Let’s get started! </p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 1: Changing the Frame Rate using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>The first step is to “speed” up the video. Let’s take the video back to pre-30fps or pre-60fps days and take it all the way down to 10 fps. This gives the video an old-school look right off the bat! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-10sec.mp4 \
-filter:v fps=fps=10 \
td-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here is the sped-up video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479524704" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 2: Give The Video a Vintage Look using FFmpeg’s filters</h2>



<p>Next, let’s change the rich, wonderful colors and bring a sepia-link tint to the entire video. This can be done using FFmpeg’s in-built <code>curves</code> filter. You can use the <code>curves</code> filter to change the amount of R, G, B in a frame and specify the “curves” that govern the change or shift in colors. </p>



<p>Luckily for us, FFmpeg has a pre-defined <code>vintage</code> filter that works pretty well, I must say! Here is the commandline to convert our sped-up video into a “vintage” looking video. Simple, right?</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-fast.mp4 \
-vf curves=vintage \
td-vintage-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here’s the result of the <code>curves=vintage</code> filter on our footall video.</p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479525304" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 3: Getting a Film Grain Overlay and Resizing It</h2>



<p>As the final step, let’s add a lot of film-grain and “scratches” to make our video look like something that was shot on film, stored in a dusty old cupboard, and discovered 40 years later! </p>



<p>I found a fantastic “old school” film overlay on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_MZb7qTenE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source link</a>) with a download link. </p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1200" height="675" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_MZb7qTenE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The video’s size is <code>1440x1080</code> pixels and so I had to resize it to <code>1920x1080</code> to match the size of my input video. </p>



<p>Here is the command to resize a video using FFmpeg using the the <code>scale</code> filter. I’ve stored the output video as <code>oldFilm1080.mp4</code>.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i old-film-grain.wmv \
-vf scale=1920:1080,setsar=1:1 \
oldFilm1080.mp4</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Step 4: Add the Overlay To Your Video</h2>



<p>Now we have two videos with us – </p>



<ol><li>our old-school film-grain-scratchy video</li><li>our vintage-looking, sped-up football video. </li></ol>



<p>Now all that’s left to do is to overlay them on each other and enjoy the fruits of <s>our</s> FFmpeg’s labor! </p>



<p>Here’s the commandline to achieve that. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe \
-i oldFilm1080.mp4 \
-i td-vintage-fast.mp4 \
-filter_complex "[0]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.25[fg];\
[1][fg]overlay[out]" \
-map [out] \
-pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -crf 18 \
touchdown-vintage.mp4</code></pre>



<p>So, what’s going on here? </p>



<ul><li>we provide two input videos to FFmpeg </li><li>using <code>filter_complex</code>, we use <code>colorchannelmixer</code> to overlay by modifying the alpha channel of the film-grain video that is referred to as <code>[0]</code> and and let’s call the output <code>[fg]</code>. It’s black and white, so modifying only the alpha is good enough for our use case. The syntax is as follows <code>colorchannelmixer=rr:rg:rb:ra:gr:gg:gb:ga:br:bg:bb:ba:ar:ag:ab:aa</code>. </li><li>we are modifying only the alpha, and so, we modify only the <code>aa</code> (output’s alpha) to <code>0.25</code>.</li><li>then, we use the vintage-looking football video (referred to as <code>[1]</code>) and overlay them both using the <code>overlay</code> filter to create an interim output stored in a variable called <code>[out]</code>. This is shown in the commands –&gt; <code>[1][fg]overlay[out]</code></li><li>then, we encode the interim output to give us the final video using H.264 with <code>crf=18</code> which should give us a good quality video.</li></ul>







<p><strong>Here is what the final output looks like! Cool, isn’t it? </strong></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529512" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>And, here’s how it looks side-by-side the original video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529447" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Now you can change the opacity of the alpha channels, use a different film grain video, or use a different <code>curves</code> function, but, the process won’t change much. </p>



<p>Hope you all have a lot of fun making “<strong>vintage</strong>” videos this holiday season and please let me know in the comments how it went! Please create some fun videos, share them with your loved ones, and have a few laughs 🙂 </p>



<p>Thank you! </p>

                </div>
                <p>Properties are a really nice feature of modern languages, and I've recently
                    gotten attached to them in Kotlin. For a while
                    I wasn't comfortable with the idea of 'fields' performing arbitrary computation,
                    but having used them for a few months now I'm really enjoying the simplicity -
                    <em>especially</em> when moving back to Java!</p>
                <p>Having given it some thought, I wanted to lay out a case in support of
                    properties which highlights their benefits over directly accessing fields (which
                    is mostly about getters/setters, but nonetheless), and how we can establish some
                    guidelines on when properties should not be used to avoid the issue of
                    arbitrary computation causing side effects or other unexpected behavior.</p>
                
                <p>In short, a property is <abbr title="Features which aid readability or ease of use but do not impact semantics.">syntax sugar</abbr> for getter/setter methods that look
                    like fields. Instead of having to use the methods <code>item.getQuantity()</code> and
                    <code>item.setQuantity()</code>, we can access the property <code>item.quantity</code> and set it
                    using <code>item.quantity = 1</code>, exactly like a field. The compiler transforms property
                    access and assignment to use the appropriate getters/setters (hence, syntax sugar).
                </p>
                <p>The most noteworthy consequence of this is, in my opinion, allowing <em>validation
                    on assigment</em>. For example, <code>item.quantity</code> may be defined as follows (in Kotlin):</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Item</span> {
    <span>var</span> <span>quantity</span>: <span>Int</span> = <span>0</span>
        <span>set</span>(value) {
            require(value &gt;= <span>0</span>) <span>//throws if negative</span>
            <span>field</span> = value
        }
}
</pre>
<pre><span>
  <i onclick="openDemo('item-property', this)"></i>
</span>item.<span>quantity</span> = <span>-10</span>;
</pre>
                
                <p>The largest benefit of properties is replacing field use, which has a massive
                    amount of drawbacks, with methods instead. In languages like C++ and Java that
                    don't have properties, the best practice is to keep all fields private and
                    manually create getters and setters. More modern languages, like C# and Kotlin,
                    use properties for this instead which can do that automatically.</p>
                <p>Most of the following points are also benefits of using getters/setters over
                    fields, and then properties step in to provide the extra bit of syntax sugar icing on
                    the cake.</p>

                        fields which are read-only for external use but still mutable within the class.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: In Kotlin, <code>val&nbsp;counter&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;private&nbsp;set</code>
                                defines a <code>counter</code> field that can be publicly accessed but not modified (unless within the class).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Getters/setters can be used to maintain <abbr title="A (mathematical) property which is expected to hold true in all cases

For example, a unit vector (3D) has the invariant x² + y² + z² == 1.">invariants</abbr> and perform other
                        validation work, such as <code>quantity&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> in the opening example.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since getters/setters are methods, the implementation can be changed without
                        breaking either <abbr title="Application Programming Interface

The interface of the *source* code">API</abbr> or <abbr title="Application Binary Interface

The interface of the *compiled* code">ABI</abbr> compatibility.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: A <code>Vector</code> class could have <code>x/y/z</code> properties, but
                                change the implementation to use a component array <code>[x, y, z]</code> instead without issue.
                            </li>
                            <li>Additionally, getters/setters can be inlined during optimization to speed up performance at the cost of ABI compatibility.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties can be used in interfaces since they're backed by methods, while fields require getters/setters to be defined for them. Notably, these getters/setters would still need to have fields defined in the implementing class to handle their values, while a property can handle that automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties can be used for methods which often behave like fields, but
                        cannot be implemented with one due to subtypes requiring computation or
                        other restrictions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: <code>List#size()</code> generally doesn't need computation and returns the
                                value of a field, but some implementations (such as a <abbr title="A form of linked list which doesn't track its size, comes from Lisp

Honestly google it, this text box can't do it justice">cons list</abbr>) might.
                            </li>
                            <li>Whether <code>List#size()</code> should be a property is certainly debatable, but with how frequently collections are used I think it's almost a necessity.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties are a <em>single unit</em>. Getters/setters are located in the same
                        location in the source code as the property declaration, making it easier to
                        fully understand a field as opposed to having them defined in separate locations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties almost always have syntax sugar for providing default
                        implementations of <code>get/set</code> (if it's not already done automatically). In Kotlin, <code>val property</code> provides a default
                        getter while <code>var property</code> provides both a getter and setter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Debugging properties is possible without a dedicated debugger by using
                        getters/setters. This may be minor for large languages, but if your language
                        doesn't have an IDE or still in development this is <em>extremely</em> useful.
                    </li>
                    <li>Readability is often increased, albeit debatable. I personally find <code>item.quantity&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</code> to
                        be more readable than <code>item.setQuantity(1)</code>, especially in large chains.
                    </li>
                    <li>Generally, properties imply 'simple' behavior, like fields, as opposed to complex
                        computation that some methods may perform. We'll talk about this in detail soon.
                    </li>

                            <span>So what are the downsides?</span>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I think there are two notable downsides to having properties. First, the
                    performance difference between field access and method calls can be significant,
                    especially in low level languages. Second, field access has clear, well-defined
                    behavior while a method call could effectively do anything, thus making it
                    harder to reason about code. Let's dig in to both of these.</p>
                
                <p>Field access is almost always language primitive, and is therefore faster than
                    doing the work of a method call (which then has to access <em>something</em> anyways).</p>
                <p>That said, compiler optimizations like <abbr title="Replacing a method call with it's implementation">inlining</abbr> can easily resolve this for
                    simple properties. In more complex cases, this is actually where properties are
                    most useful - a field itself wasn't sufficient, so the alternative would have
                    been a method call or sacrificing validation anyways.</p>
                <p>In low level languages where memory layout is often important, knowing a field
                    access corresponds to a memory lookup (and not arbitrary computation) can be
                    important. In higher level languages, particularly Object Oriented ones that
                    often encapsulate fields behind methods anyways, I don't believe this
                    distinction is as necessary.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                            <span>
                                <a href="#problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                                    <i></i>
                                </a>
                            </span>
                            <span>Problem 2: Arbitrary Computation</span>
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, we've made our way to what I believe is the core issue: since
                    properties can perform arbitrary computation, it is unclear what potential
                    behavior getting/setting a property may have. The extreme example here, of
                    course, is deleting the entire file system. Fields on the other hand have
                    clearly defined behavior - get or set the value, nothing more.</p>
                <p>However, these type of assumptions are not unique to properties. We apply the
                    same assumptions to methods (and honestly everything) as well. I often presume
                    that <code>getX()</code> and <code>setX(x)</code> have 'simple' behavior, but they could use lazy
                    initialization, have unexpected validation checks, or cause side-effects and
                    other unexpected behavior
                    like a database <code>getConnection()</code>. Naming is one of the two hard problems in computer science,
                    likely because we carry assumptions with us that may not always fit.</p>
                <p>That said, these assumptions …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

  20 minutes

            </p>

            <p>Every story needs a hero. But, not all heroes are the same. Some of them have superpowers, and some are ordinary people. This story’s hero is just a regular software developer who works in a small team on a medium-size application. Our hero loves his job most of the time, except when he sends a test push notification to thousands of their customers in production, like a few minutes ago.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/01-push-notifications.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One day, his boss came with a new project. “We need to build a new complex application for our new important customer.” Nice, our hero loves challenges! “But we need to do it fast, as we have a short deadline because they have an important marketing event!” Ok, how fast do we need to build an app? “It needs to be ready for yesterday. And it needs to be real-time and scalable!”</p>

<p>The new project is a big challenge for our hero, as he never did that kind of project. Can he even do it?</p>

<p>“You can do it,” his boss says. “I also hired a famous consultant to help you.” That’s awesome! Challenge accepted.</p>

<p>After a full-day meeting with the consultant, and a whiteboard full of weird diagrams, the plan was simple: “Just use Kubernetes!”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/02-consultant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But our hero doesn’t know Kubernetes. And there’s no time to learn it now. What should he do?</p>

<p>He started wondering if he is the only one who doesn’t know Kubernetes. Is he good enough for this job?</p>

<p>Our hero spent a sleepless night in front of his computer with his faithful sidekick, a rubber duck. He tried to learn as much as he can about this new technology. But he ended up more confused and tired.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/03-sidekick.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="you-should-try-serverless-graphql">You should try Serverless GraphQL</h2>

<p>In the middle of the night, our hero’s faithful sidekick said, “you should try serverless GraphQL.”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/04-try-serverless-graphql.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Was he dreaming? And what the heck is serverless GraphQL? He knows what serverless is, but what’s GraphQL?</p>

<h3 id="whats-graphql">What’s GraphQL</h3>

<p>Do you remember when Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">said</a>, “our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5?” It was a long time ago, back in 2012, when HTML5 was in its early days.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Facebook mobile app was an HTML5 web app embedded in the native mobile shell. They served all the news feed updates as HTML data from the server. However, HTML5 was in its early days, and the mobile web views were not performant enough, so the app wasn’t stable and scalable enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/05-fb-mobile-app.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2012, Facebook’s engineering team started rebuilding their mobile and switching to the native iOS and Android apps. They evaluated different options for delivering the news feed data, including RESTful services  and Facebook Query Language (FQL).</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">“GraphQL: A data query language”</a> article in 2015, Lee Byron wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were frustrated with the differences between the data we wanted to use in our apps and the server queries they required. We don’t think of data in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; we think about it in terms of a graph of objects and the models we ultimately use in our apps like NSObjects or JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This frustration led the Facebook engineering team to rethink the way they serve data to their mobile application. Instead of returning a full model with a lot of unnecessary data, they tried to develop a new system to return only the data the application needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/06-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2015, they <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">announced</a> GraphQL, an open-source data query language. The idea behind GraphQL was simple, the client defines the data structure, and the server provides a JSON response with precisely the same format.</p>

<p>For example, the client wants to get the user with a specified ID. However, the application needs only the user’s name, a profile photo with a specific size, and the first five friend connections. Instead of sending two or three different requests to the RESTful API, with GraphQL, you can send a request similar to the one in the image below. And the response will be the JSON with the same structure, as you can see on the right side of the same image.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/07-an-example.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That sounds nice and smart. But why should our hero care about GraphQL? He doesn’t have the same problem Facebook had.</p>

<p>The problem Facebook’s engineering team had was the leading cause for inventing GraphQL. However, that’s not the only problem GraphQL solves. If you have one of the following symptoms, GraphQL might be the cure for the problems your application faces, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distinct front end clients for multiple platforms, such as web and mobile, have different data requirements.</li>
  <li>Your back end serves data to your client apps from different sources. For example, your app has SQL and NoSQL databases, and it connects to some external systems.</li>
  <li>Your app has a complex state and caching managements for both front end and back end.</li>
  <li>Slow pages, especially on mobile, caused by multiple dependant HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not complete, and GraphQL can bring even more benefits to your application. Some of the main characteristics of GraphQL are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It defines a data shape. The request always specifies the response’s form, which makes requests more predictable and easier to use.</li>
  <li>It’s hierarchical. Its strict relation between objects with graph-structured data simplifies getting data from multiple sources.</li>
  <li>It’s strongly typed. It can give you descriptive error messages before you run a query.</li>
  <li>It’s a protocol, not storage. Each GraphQL field is backed by a function on the back end, which allows you to connect it to any storage you want in the background.</li>
  <li>It’s introspective. You can query the GraphQL server for the types it supports. This gives you built-in documentation and also a base for a powerful toolset.</li>
  <li>It’s version free. The shape of the data is always defined by the client’s request, which means adding additional fields to your model will not affect your client application until you change the query itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>To combine data from multiple sources using RESTful API, you often send multiple HTTP requests and then connect data on the client-side. This works fine in perfect conditions. However, users don’t always use your app in ideal conditions. They are often on mobile with a limited or unstable network. Or they live in Australia, and each request is a few hundred milliseconds slower.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/08-multiple-data-sources.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>With GraphQL, you can archive the same with a single request. This will push a bit more load to the server-side, but that works just fine in most cases. It’s even better when you don’t own the server.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/09-graphql-request.gif" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="where-to-start-with-graphql">Where to start with GraphQL</h3>

<p>With GraphQL, you start by shaping your data using types. For example, if you are building a blog, you will have an author and a post, similar to the following code snippet. Each post will have its id, a name, a title, and an author. Authors have their ids, names, and a list of their posts.</p>

<p>As you can see, types also define a relation between an author and posts.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>posts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>text</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>author</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have types, you can build your GraphQL schema. In the code snippet below, we define two queries: get author by ID and get posts by title. Each of these queries defines input parameters with their types and a return type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
  </span><span>getPostsByTitle</span><span>(</span><span>titleContains</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>query</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As GraphQL is not storage but a protocol, we need to tell GraphQL where and how it can read the data by creating resolvers. In the following code snippet, we define two resolvers: one for the author that connects to the SQL database and one for a list of posts sends an HTTP request to the blog platform API.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>getAuthor(_, args){
  return sql.raw('SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id = %s', args.id);
}

posts(author){
  return request(`https://api.blog.io/by_author/${author.id}`);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we can run the query. As we defined queries, we can ask for an author by their ID. Relations allow us to get a list of all author’s posts in the same request. And if we ask for the author’s name for each blog post, that name will be the same as the author’s name above because it points to the same author.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>){</span><span>
    </span><span>name</span><span>
    </span><span>posts</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>title</span><span>
      </span><span>author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span># this will be the same as the name above</span><span>
        </span><span>name</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once we run the query, GraphQL will parse the request, then validate the types and data shape, and finally, if the first two steps are correct, it will run the query and our resolvers. Once we receive the data, it’ll look similar to the following JSON data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"posts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The power of serverless GraphQL with AppSync"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Handling webhooks with EventBridge, SAM and SAR"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>By GraphQL specification, queries read the data. GraphQL specification also defines mutations and subscriptions. Mutations modify the existing data (i.e., add a new author or edit post), and subscriptions can notify you whenever the data is changed (i.e., it’ll run whenever the post is published).</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-serverless-graphql">Why do we need serverless GraphQL?</h3>

<p>“You can always deploy your GraphQL using Kubernetes and write your resolvers by hand,” the rubber duck said, “but there’s an easier way.”</p>

<p>GraphQL makes retrieving your data from the client-side effortless, but you still need to manage and scale your infrastructure. And now, you have one central place that controls all of your requests. Unless you do the same you do with the other web applications – make your application serverless. Serverless GraphQL brings the best of both worlds: GraphQL makes you client-to-server connection effortless, and serverless simplifies maintenance of your infrastructure.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/10-scaling.png" alt=""></p>

<p>“Interesting, but how do I make GraphQL application serverless?”</p>

<p>“There are many ways to do that,” the rubber duck said. “You can do that manually using the familiar serverless services. For example, on AWS, you can use Amazon API …</p></div></div></div></div>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

or <b>Better Digital Living By Making Things Harder For Yourself</b><br>
or <b>I spent a Year Without Facebook and Google - Here's What Happened Next</b><br>
</p>

<p><em>Autumn 2020</em></p>


<p>
It's easy to grow disillusioned with tech, even to the point that it 
appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile. The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>(Photo by <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/@sulimansallehi?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Suliman Sallehi</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/grey-concrete-structure-1481829/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a>)</strong></p><p>(<strong>Warning</strong>: This is not a climate denial post, it's my reflection on the state of current affairs)</p><p>The idea of Climate Change doesn't seem to have product-market fit. They've marketed it hard and for decades but it's not really taking off. They've held multiple conferences with a range of &nbsp;popular or obscure characters as keynote speakers, tried bundling it with other products, and made some pretty good cartoons and movies about. And yet society as a whole's doesn't seem to be buying it.</p><p>No one cares about the fact that Climate Change is happening and accelerating. Not really.</p><p>Don't get me wrong - there's lot's of talk <em>about</em> caring about Climate Change, but the real issue is not being seriously address by anyone. Let me explain.</p><h2 id="in-politics-climate-change-is-just-gang-sign-or-pom-poms-">In politics, Climate Change is just gang-sign. Or pom-poms.</h2><p>Climate change is often mentioned in political discussions and, for some reason, seems to be a largely partisan issue, specifically in the Western world. </p><p>It's an excellent tool to signal your affiliation. You see, if you paint it one colour, you can use it as a patch on your conservative jacket. Go Reds! When you paint it another, it's great insignia for your liberal banners. Go Blues! What colour words you use tells other people which gang you belong to.</p><p>For politicians Climate Change is mostly taken seriously as a tool too rile their base. It's very useful to shake around and manipulate your team's spirit. Rah-rah-rah!</p><p>For the conservatives, you're expected to doubt it's veracity, or at the very least, play down its seriousness. Conservative-lites, for instance, will very vaguely argue that technology and human ingenuity will eventually help us all coast this annoying artifact of progress. Full-fat conservatives will go whole-hog and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-skeptics-want-more-co2/">argue it'll be of net benefit to society</a>.</p><p>On the liberal side they have their own range of cheers. Liberal-lites are very keen on raising taxes on production, which they argue would somehow help cool down the world. Full-fat liberals try to use Climate Change as an argument for going communist, because we all know communist societies won't engage in any industrialised production.</p><p>But both sides merely skirt around the issue when it comes down to it. It's merely one string connected to the levers which make their supporters dance. And it's often used as a more palatable brand to be wrapped like a mask over schemes that try and force action of other, unrelated kinds, that they know would not have broader public appear.</p><h2 id="for-large-orgs-it-s-press-release-porn">For large Orgs, it's press release porn</h2><p>Then there's the giant multinationals and intergovernmental organisations. They love to throw around the words "Climate" or "Environmentally friendly" too. It's excellent press-release porn.</p><p>There's a regular, periodic drip of kumbaya-like statements from these hydras, with vague expressions of their "great concerns" and "action needing to be taken". The young folks loves that shit, right? </p><p>You see, a well-crafted press release is amazing for creating the illusion of action. It's excellent moral insurance cover. "We often spoke about our concerns, with quite a lot of words and various agreeable degrees of sternness."</p><p>Then there's the epic events. Climate Change is a pretty rad reason to organise those. They have them often. Fly a whole bunch of delegates to this expensive venue in that remote country. There's lots of food and freebies, well-lit stages, fancy hotels and banquets. The pamphlets and banners with their tastefully designed artwork make for excellent photo-op backdrops. The world needs to see how much these very important organisations and their people care. </p><p>For-profit organisations also know how to use Climate Change effectively. It's marketing gold - so hot right now! It's a very effective tool to justify asking for more money while giving less in return. Tell your customers it's for the good of the colony! That charger that you now need to buy separately will surely save us all.</p><p>My point is of course that when it comes to Climate Change<em>,</em> the leaders of our societies, even the ones that don't outright deny that it's happening, all shout out slogans, make speeches, and then recede into the shadows of bureaucracy.</p><p>"Showing support" is easy, cheap and keeps the masses content. No serious thought or action is being mustered into how we're <em>actually</em> going to deal with the arrival of this c<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-climate-change-report-human-civilization-at-risk-extinction-by-2050-new-australian-climate/">ivilisation-ending threat</a>. </p><p>Some parts of some governments <em>are</em> actually thinking about it, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/2/24/21145687/climate-change-usa-military-book-interview">like the militaries,</a> but for the rest it's just lip service.</p><p>"COVID!", you might retort, "showed us that governments <em>can</em> take swift and decisive action! So there's hope! We just need to vote more and start grass-roots movements!"</p><p>Well, sure, governments did take action with COVID. But most of them took too little action too late. And let's not even go into the mad-surge of power grabbing that happened - the rights being sacrificed on the altar of Security. Or my own government taking the opportunity to elevate corruption and state-looting to new, ever-refined heights.</p><p>But sure, let's simplify it and just consider the fact that action was taken. The problem is that action was only taken when the sparks began to fly. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/revealed-the-inside-story-of-europes-divided-coronavirus-response">Action was taken when the viruses were at the gate</a>. Rome had to fall before anyone felt bothered enough to get up.</p><p>Another example of when people collectively decided to take mass action was with the BLM protests. Or the recent electoral battle between the two old men in the US. Magnificent events, for sure. The people made their voices heard. </p><p>But on closer consideration, doesn't it simply add more evidence to my assertion that nobody really believes in Climate Change? It's clearly not deemed important enough to warrant similar such action.</p><p>Well, that's not really true, I guess. </p><p>There was the Climate Change protests in 2019, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_climate_strikes#:~:text=The%20September%202019%20climate%20strikes,place%20from%2020%E2%80%9327%20September.&amp;text=The%2020%20September%20protests%20were,climate%20strikes%20in%20world%20history.">Global Week for Future</a>. Let's be honest though, nothing really came of that. Lot's of noise was made, lots of fun chanting. School was skipped, selfies were taken. Camaraderie was felt, but <em>actual</em> change was as good as being on holiday. And ever so swiftly, with the emergence of the virus shenanigans, Greta &amp; co also faded into the background.</p><p>Then there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. They're hard core. Excellent name too, really catchy. Too extreme for mainstream narratives though, too aggressive and offensive. You can't run feel-good stories after covering that lot. The responsible media can't support such hooliganism.</p><p>So I admit, there <em>were</em> social movements trying to rouse society into action, but they lost steam and fizzled out. Not enough traction. Not compelling enough. Just a fad. No product-market fit.</p><p>I've been thinking about this for quite a while. It's a recurring theme when reading some of the comments on Reddit and HackerNews when the weekly Climate horror threads bubble up. Is it hopelessness, disbelief, distant consequences or laziness? </p><p>Because i<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3041/beating-back-the-tides/">t's</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109152241.htm">not</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/13/rising-levels-of-carbon-dioxide-increasing-extreme-weather-events-in-australia-report-finds">due</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/hurricane-eta-storm-2020-climate-change-b892557.html">to</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/arctic-sea-ice-level-climate-change-global-warming-siberia-b1345792.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/08/russian-scientists-find-powerful-ever-methane-seep-arctic-ocean/">lack</a> <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3008/stunning-forecast-a-century-of-ice-loss-for-nearly-100000-glaciers/">of</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">evidence</a>.

Thrilling stuff. </p><p>Here's a trailer.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCxPOqwCr1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The Limits to Growth caused quite the stir.

That has been done millions of times before and is just a Google search away. </p><p>Neither is the aim to go through the all the specific claims of books and studies like the Limits of Growth with a fine-toothed comb to judge exactly how accurate they are. This is not necessary, because there've been enough different studies focussing on different aspects of our effect on the environment, and they all seem to come together as pixels of same picture.</p><p>Make no mistake, it sure looks like the apocalypse is coming.

If you have participated in a discussion about Elixir, you may have heard “you may not need Redis with Elixir”. Given that Redis has many use cases, this sentence may confuse developers as they try to match Elixir’s different features against Redis’ capabilities. This article aims to explore different scenarios where the above is true, when they are not, and which trade-offs you may want to consider. We will discuss four cases:</p>

Before we start, I want to emphasize we find Redis a fantastic piece of technology. This is not a critique of Redis but rather a discussion of the different options Elixir developers may have available.</p>
<h2 id="post-pubsub">
  Case #1: Distributed PubSub</h2>
<p>
The first scenario where you may not need Redis with Elixir is Distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>. Throughout this section, we will consider PubSub systems to provide <strong>at-most-once delivery</strong>: they broadcast events to the currently available subscribers. If a subscriber is not around, they won’t receive the message later.</p>
<p>
For this reason, PubSub systems are often paired with databases to offer persistence. For example, every time someone sends a message in a chat application, the system can save the contents to the database and then broadcast it to all users. This means everyone connected at a given moment sees the update immediately, but disconnected users can catch up later.</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have multiple nodes, and you want to exchange messages between said nodes. In Elixir, thanks to the Erlang VM, which ships with distribution support, this can be as simple as:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span>.</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>send</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">{</span><span>:known_name</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:hello_world</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub/blob/master/lib/phoenix/pubsub.ex">200LOC or less</a>, you can implement a PubSub system that broadcasts to all subscribers within the same node or anywhere else in a cluster, without bringing any third-party tools. At best, you will need <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster">libcluster</a> - an Elixir library - to establish the connection between the nodes based on some strategy (K8s, AWS, DNS, etc.).</p>
<p>
In other words, PubSub pretty much ships out of the box with Elixir. Technologies without distribution would need to rely on Redis PubSub, PostgreSQL Notifications, or similar to achieve the same.</p>
<p>
Of course, the above assumes your infrastructure allows you to directly establish connections between nodes, which may not be possible in some PaaS, such as Heroku. In those cases, you can use any of the technologies above (Phoenix <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub_redis/">has a Redis adapter</a> for its PubSub), or alternatively use platforms, such as <a href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a>, that make it trivial to setup a cluster.</p>
<h2 id="post-presence">
  Case #2: Presence</h2>
<p>
Presence is the ability to track who is connected in a cluster right now — the “who” may be users, phones, IoT devices, etc. For example, if Alice is connected to node A, she wants to see that Bob is also available, even if he has joined node B.</p>
<p>
Presence is one of the problems that are more complicated to implement than it sounds. For example, let’s consider implementing Presence by storing the connected entities in a database. However, what happens if a node crashes or leaves the cluster? Because the node crashed, all the users connected to it must be removed, but the node itself cannot do so. Therefore the other nodes need to detect those failure scenarios and act accordingly. But observing failures in a distributed system is also complicated: how do you differentiate between a temporarily unresponsive node from one that permanently failed?</p>
<p>
Another common approach to solve this problem is to frequently write to a database while users are connected. If you have seen no writes within a timeframe, you consider those users to be disconnected. However, such solutions have to choose between being write-intensive or inaccurate. For instance, let’s say that users become disconnected after 1 minute. This means that you need to write to the database every 1 minute for every user. If you have 10k users, that’s 167 writes per second, only to track that the users are connected. Meanwhile, the gap between a user leaving and having their status reflected in the UI is, in the worst-case scenario, also 1 minute. Any attempt at reducing the number of writes implies an increased gap.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir’s clustering support, we can once more implement <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> without a need for third-party dependencies! We use a PubSub system to implement Presence, as we need to notify as users join and leave. Instead of relying on centralized storage, the nodes directly communicate and exchange information about who is around. This removes the need for frequent writes. When a user leaves, this is also reflected immediately.</p>
<p>
So while you can use Redis or another storage to provide Presence, Elixir can deliver a solution that is efficient and doesn’t require third-party tools.</p>
<h2 id="post-caching">
  Case #3: Caching</h2>
<p>
The solutions to previous cases were built on top of Erlang’s unique distribution capabilities. In the following sections, the distinguishing factor between needing Redis or not will be <strong>multi-core concurrency</strong>, so this discussion is more generally applicable. Therefore, when we say Elixir in this section, it will also apply to JVM, Go, and other environments. They will contrast to Ruby, Python, and Node.js, in which their primary runtimes do not provide adequate multi-core concurrency within a single Operating System process.</p>
<p>
Let’s start with the non-concurrent scenario. Consider you are building a web application in Ruby, Python, etc. To deploy it, you get two eight-core machines. In languages that do not provide satisfactory multi-core concurrency, a common option for deployment is to start 8 instances of your web application, one per core, on each node. Overall, you will have CxN instances, where C is the number of cores, and N is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>
Now consider a particular operation in this application that is expensive, and you want to cache its results. The easiest solution, regardless of your programming environment, is to cache it in memory. However, given we have 16 instances of this application, caching it in memory is suboptimal: we will have to perform this expensive operation at least 16 times, one for each instance. For this reason, it is widespread to use Redis, Memcached, or similar for caching in environments like Ruby, Python, etc. With Redis, you would cache it only once, and it will be shared across all instances. The trade-off is that we are replacing memory access by a network round-trip, and the latter is orders of magnitude more expensive.</p>
<p>
Now let’s consider environments with multi-core concurrency. In languages like Elixir, you start one instance per node, regardless of the number of cores, since the runtime will share memory and efficiently spread the work across all cores. When it comes to caching, keeping the cache in-memory is a much more affordable scenario, as you will only have to compute once per node. Therefore, you have the <em>option</em> to skip Redis or Memcached altogether and avoid network round-trip.</p>
<p>
Of course, this depends on how many nodes you are effectively running in production. Luckily, many companies report being able to <a href="https://dev.to/erlangsolutions/why-elixir-is-the-programming-language-you-should-learn-in-2020-5g00">run Elixir with an order of magnitude less nodes</a> than technologies they have migrated from.</p>
<p>
You can also choose a mixed approach and store the cache both in-memory and in Redis. First, you look up in memory and, if missing, you fallback to Redis. If unavailable in both, then you execute the operation and cache it in each. The critical part to highlight here is that multi-core environments give you more flexibility to tackle these problems while reducing resource utilization. In Elixir/Erlang, you can also keep the cache in memory and use PubSub to distribute it across nodes. You can see this last approach in action <a href="https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags">in the excellent FunWithFlags library</a>.</p>
<p>
Another trade-off to consider is that all in-memory cache will be gone once you deploy new nodes. Therefore, if you need data to persist across deployments, you will want to use Redis as a cache layer, as detailed above, or dump the cache in a storage, such as database, S3, or Redis, before each deployment.</p>
<h2 id="post-async">
  Case #4: Asynchronous processing</h2>
<p>
Another scenario you may not need Redis in Elixir is to perform asynchronous processing. Let’s continue the discussion from the previous case.</p>
<p>
In environments without or with limited multi-core concurrency, given each instance is assigned to one core, they are limited in their ability to handle requests concurrently. This has led to a common saying that “you should avoid blocking the main thread”. For example, imagine that your application has to deliver emails on sign up or generate some computationally expensive reports. While one of your 16 web instances is doing this, it cannot handle other incoming requests efficiently. For this reason, a common choice here is to move the work elsewhere, typically a background-job processing queue. First, you store the work to be done on Redis or similar. Then one of the 16 web instances (or more commonly a completely different set of workers) grabs it from the queue.</p>
<p>
In multi-core concurrent environments, requests can be handled concurrently regardless if they are doing CPU or IO work. Sending the email from the request itself won’t block other requests. Generating the report is not a problem, as requests can be served by other CPUs. These platforms typically get assigned as many requests as they can handle and they distribute the work over the machine resources. Even if you prefer to deliver emails outside of the request, in order to send an earlier response to users, you can spawn an asynchronous worker without a need to move the delivery to an external queue or to another machine. Once again, concurrency gives us a more straightforward option to tackle these scenarios.</p>
<p>
Note the Erlang VM takes care of multiplexing CPU and IO work without a need for developers to tag functions as async or similar. Workers in Erlang/Elixir are …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  </header>
  <p>I have a small side project: <a href="https://hacker.gifts/">digital gift cards for hackers</a>. It uses Shopify for all the store-related stuff: frontend, payments, refunds, reports, etc.</p>

<p>But unlike regular digital products (ebooks, videos) I wanted each card that the user purchases from the store to be unique. So I made a  script that generates personalized images and ran it manually for every order.</p>

<p>The next logical step was automating this process. I started with serverless AWS Lambda. At the time it was the hot new tech and I wanted to learn more. It seemed very fitting for my use-case: single-responsibility functions that can run at any time and don’t require server maintenance.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/simple-lambda.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was super easy to get started. I built a JavaScript function and deployed it to AWS Lambda, added Shopify web hook and it all worked!</p>

<p>Early benefits of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to get started</li>
  <li>Don’t have to configure or maintain servers</li>
  <li>Free for small loads</li>
</ul>

<p>In reality, writing the simple Lambda functions turned out to be only 10% of the work.</p>

<p>Time passed and my backend started getting more complex: I needed to store some state for each <a href="https://hacker.gifts/products/space-invaders">puzzle</a>, send confirmation emails, show an order details page. What started as a simple function, grew into a bunch of serverless functions, SNS topics, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables. All bound together with plenty of YAML glue, schema-less JSON objects passed around and random hardcoded configs in AWS console.</p>

<p>I think it’s just a typical software development lifecycle: things grow organically, become a mess, and require some refactoring. Make it run first (discover market fit), then make it right (refactor to integrate the new discoveries).</p>

<p>But this time it was different. I couldn’t refactor things as easily as I used to in traditional monolithic apps. Here’s why:</p>

<p>When the building blocks are too simple, the complexity moves into the interaction between the blocks.</p>

<p>And the interactions between the serverless blocks happen <em>outside</em> my application. A lambda publishes a message to SNS, another one picks it up and writes something to DynamoDB, the third one takes that new record and sends an email…</p>

<p>I could test every single block in that flow, but I didn’t have confidence in the overall process. What if publishing fails, how would I know that? How would system recover? Can I rollback and try again? Where do the logs go?</p>

<p>Another swarm of problems was hiding in my configuration: bad Route 53 record, typos in SNS topics, wrong S3 bucket region. Tracing errors was a challenge, there’s no single log output I can look into.</p>

<p>With serverless, I was no longer dealing with my project's domain, I was dealing with the distributed system's domain.</p>

<p>At this point I felt fooled.</p>

<p>I came for the easy way to deploy code and not think about servers, but in the end had to design my system around the platform’s limitations.</p>

<p>Drawbacks of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hard to follow information flow</li>
  <li>Impossible to replicate production environment locally</li>
  <li>Slow iteration speed</li>
  <li>Lack of end-to-end testing</li>
  <li>Immature documentation (dominated by often outdated Medium posts)</li>
  <li>No conventions (have to make hundreds of unessential decisions)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>I was clearly not enjoying the serverless. So I decided to rewrite it. After all, it is a side project I’m doing for fun. The tech stack of choice — Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Rails since 2013, and for the last 8 years at Facebook I’ve been mostly doing JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/logo.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The experience of picking Rails back up was really nice but… uneventful. Not much had really changed. A few things got added, a few small things moved around.</p>

<p>Of course I did <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/38060">hit some magical Ruby issues</a>. But unlike my typical experience with JavaScript, I was quickly able to find the solution.</p>

<p>Rails comes with so many things built-in and configured. Over the years, without Rails, I used to gluing random JavaScript libraries together to roll my own routing, file storage wrappers, email preview pipeline, managing secrets, test setup with fixtures, database migrations, logging, performance reporting, deployment scripts. With Rails I didn’t have to think about all these details and could simply focus on making product-visible changes.</p>

<p>It was like driving a Tesla after years of making my own scrappy cars. Similar components, but all configured and aligned to work well together.</p>

<p>Benefits of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conventions</li>
  <li>Tooling, libraries</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Monolith is easy to understand and test</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feels heavyweight in the beginning</li>
  <li>Hurts if your opinions differ from Rails conventions</li>
  <li>Have to host on a server</li>
  <li>Doesn’t sound cool in 2020 (anymore and maybe yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but gravity sucked me in and I spent most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Concords is an MVP framework for building offline &amp; decentralised web apps, with a file-based approach to storing data. It has no servers or databases and is a static app built with Javascript and HTML, all code is written to run in a browser and nothing is stored outside of the browser or downloaded files.</p> <p>The full MVP is available to try at <a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alpha.concords.app</a></p> <h2 id="why">Why?</h2> <p>SAAS applications run on servers with databases. Each interaction with the UI sends information from the browser to a server, which then likely writes something or fetches something from a centralized database.</p> <p>Maintaining servers and databases is expensive, complex and time-consuming and I'm not really interested in that side of software. I don't want the responsibility to look after data that is depended upon, that's neither my skill-set nor passion. I like to focus my attention on the front-end experience.</p> <p>I set out to build a framework for file-based SAAS apps. Multi-user collaborative apps, with data-driven user flows and advanced UI. But apps that run offline and save state to the filesystem, not send it off to a cloud-based database. Giving users full ownership and visibility of their data, with no dependency on an internet connection. Taking a progressive approach to connectivity, using it to enrich the experience, but not depend on it.</p> <h2 id="technical-steps">Technical Steps</h2> <ul> <li><p>Functional blockchain library in Typescript.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Svelte</a> &amp; <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sapper</a> for all things UI.</p> </li> <li><p>Blockchain sync with IndexedDB and reactivity hook.</p> </li> <li><p>Created <a href="https://1.0.0.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some mini-apps</a> to refine and test the core functionality.</p> </li> <li><p>User Authentication flow.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MVP: Kanban app</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="concords-mvp-board-app">Concords MVP: Board App</h2> <p>This MVP serves to demonstrate a basic solution to a truly offline and decentralized experience in a collaborative web app. It's a static app, so just Javascript and HTML, with no servers or databases running in the background. It's a progressive web app with a service worker, that runs entirely in the browser. So once the initial load has been performed, the rest of the experience can work completely offline, where data is stored in files, downloaded and uploaded through the UI.</p> <p>A boards app covers a lot of functionality commonly found in SAAS applications, I figured it's a great benchmark to prove out the technology.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/add-task.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>With Concords, authentication is all done in the browser, without any communication to a server or external resource.</p> <p>In the Concords authentication system, we issue a downloadable public profile which includes your public key and some basic user info. I keep mine for the MVP on my personal domain. <a href="https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json</a></p> <p>Anyone with access to my public key is able to encrypt data for me, that only I can read with my private key. I just have that stored on my personal machine. It’s never been online and no-one else knows it.</p> <p>This key is used to log the user into the app and only a valid key combination can login and access the software.</p> <p>For my MVP, this is more than sufficient to complete and decent authentication flow. We can have a recognisable UX of profile/password combination to build a login system, whilst setting us up for an encrypted, multi-user, data flow.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/signup.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <p>I know it's a pain to ask users to store both parts of their encryption keys themselves. If the private key is lost, it's unrecoverable and so is any encrypted data to that key. But I couldn't compromise here, it has to be this way to keep things decentralized. But it's a problem that can be fixed through software, it doesn't have to be my software - we're decentralizing things here, but key management software will fix this problem.</p> <h3 id="the-app">The App</h3> <p>Knowing roughly what I needed to build to prove out the concept, and having already implemented User Profile and the authentication flow, the key features I chose to implement were:</p> <ul> <li>Create new and multiple boards</li> <li>Downloadable app files</li> <li>Load any board, from any user</li> <li>Assign tasks to users</li> <li>Editable tasks</li> <li>Timestamped actions</li> <li>Drag to sort columns</li> <li>Draggable tasks across columns</li> <li>Soft delete tasks to the trash, with restore and remove</li> <li>Activity log with an immutable history of the board</li> </ul> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/create-board.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h4 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h4> <p>By default, a new user doesn't have edit access to a document. For the purpose of the MVP, we've got a "Join" button in the left-hand sidebar. Clicking this will add the user as an entry to the data store and unlock editing. This covers the concept enough for now, but we are able to achieve direct encryption with the public/private key authentication, so that's going to be an interesting avenue to explore further outside of the MVP context.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/third-user.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="core-library">Core Library</h3> <p>The core of the framework is written in Typescript. It's a collection of functional utilities which cover the data side of the application. It runs an internal blockchain for writing data, mapped with an IndexDB instance for reading.</p> <h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4> <p>At the heart of the library is the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/merkle-tree-what-is-it-and-why-use-it-8m2a63xjd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Merkel Tree</a> solution. Our Merkle Tree (as used in Blockchain and git), is a functional library to act as a blockchain node, from a JSON object structure, in the browser.</p> <p>Built on top of that is a CRUD API which the application will interface with. When an action is performed in the app, a timestamped transaction is created for the blockchain. Once commit, all pending transactions are then added to a block on the chain. Once a block has been added to the blockchain, the hash-based data structure ensures the integrity of the app state.</p> <pre><code>{

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my Amiga, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Lazy loading is a very cool design pattern that is not often talked about. Many frameworks implement it without even telling us about it ðŸ˜Š. For example, .NET Entity Framework (all versions) support the pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is lazy loading? The idea behind the pattern is simple. By using lazy loading, we defer the initialization of objects (heavy ones) until we need them. Thatâ€™s it.</p>



<p>Letâ€™s provide an example. We have a simple HR application. The application supports the tracking of employee records. Each record has standard fields like name, email, date of birth, and image (like a profile picture), etc.</p>



<p>The application has operations like adding employees, updating employees, searching for an employee, generating reports, etc. Do all functions need the image of the employee? Should we load images in some aggregated reports? Of course not. A picture can take a lot of resources, so it is not reasonable to load it everywhere. And here, lazy loading comes to help us.</p>



<h2>Lazy loading implementation</h2>



<p>There are several ways to implement the lazy loading pattern, but we are going to inspect the most used one (when it comes to manual implementation).</p>



<p>In the source code, the employee domain model is represented like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ALL THE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>Nothing special. Just a class with three fields and a method which would load all the data. But as we said, most of the time, we do not want the Image data because it could take a lot of resources.</p>



<p>So, how do we <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactor</a> the class? We do It like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> image<span>;</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>get</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>image <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>else</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>set</span> <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ONLY NAME AND EMAIL PROPERTIES.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING AND RETURNING IMAGE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>We followed only four steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Extract the logic for image data load from the Load method to a new Method â€“ LoadImage;</li><li>Introduce a new private field for the image data;</li><li>Refactor the Image property to check if image data is null. If it is, the new method loads the image data, assigns it to the image field, and then return it to the consumer.</li></ol>



<p>Next time we load the object (or objects if we load a collection of them), we wonâ€™t have the overhead of loading unnecessary image data. We are going to extract the image data only when we need it (by accessing Image property).</p>



<h2><strong>ORMs</strong></h2>



<p>ORMs like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entity Framework Core</a> support lazy loading. When a query is executed, not all the properties are loaded (unless you have disabled lazy loading). Only by accessing them, another query runs to fetch the data.</p>



<p>For example, imagine we have two entities in relation: a Company entity and an Employee entity. A company has many employees. If we query for a specific company by id and we get a result, the list of its employees wonâ€™t be loaded. Only when we access them a new query will fetch the collection.</p>



<p>In some cases, this is cool in others, not ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>Can we implement our own lazy loading if we are using some ORM? Sure. The thing you should do is not to map properties/entities that donâ€™t need to be loaded with every query. Of course, you should provide proper methods to handle the data that is not loaded.</p>



<p>In Entity Framework, you use the [NotMapped] attribute to annotate desired properties.</p>



<p>You can read in many places that lazy loading is used when accessing network resources. That is true but not complete. You can use lazy loading also for any demanding operation, like complex computations, reading big chunks of local data, etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>You’re happily working your way through a codebase when you happen upon some code that makes you stop and think: What the…!? Maybe it’s a method that’s doing something surprising. Or perhaps it’s doing something completely unsurprising, it’s just doing it in a surprising way.</p>

<p><img src="https://tekin.co.uk/images/20201113/math-lady.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="git-blame-to-the-rescue">Git blame to the rescue?</h2>

<p>When this happens you might instinctively reach for <code>git blame</code> to help you figure out what’s going on. After all, <code>git blame</code> gives you the commit that most recently touched the line, and often that’s enough to point you in the right direction. But often it isn’t and you’re none the wiser. That’s because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>git blame is too coarse</strong>: it reports against the whole line. If the most recent change isn’t related to the part of the line you’re interested, you’re out of luck.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too shallow</strong>: it only reports a single change; the most recent one. The story of the particular piece of code you’re interested in may have evolved over several commits.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too narrow</strong>: it only considers the file you are running blame against. The code you are interested in may also appear in other files, but to get the relevant commits on those you’ll need to run blame several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only use <code>git blame</code> you’re limiting yourself to a one-dimensional perspective of the code you’re trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be better to view things in 3D!?</p>

<h2 id="a-more-powerful-way-to-trace-the-history-of-wtf-code">A more powerful way to trace the history of WTF code</h2>

<p>Thankfully Git has some pretty powerful search tools built right in. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tools at our disposal.</p>

<h2 id="find-all-commits-containing-a-particular-piece-code">Find all commits containing a particular piece code</h2>

<p>If <code>git blame</code> is entry-level history search, <code>git log -S</code> (also known as “the pickaxe”) is how you take things to the next level. It lets you search for all commits that contain a given string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git log <span>-S</span> <span>"method_name"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will return all the commits that contain <code>method_name</code> across the entire repository, giving you a bespoke history of a piece of code across both multiple commits and files. You can use the pickaxe to examine the entire history of a particular snippet: all the places it’s been used; how it’s usage has changed; if it’s moved file; when it was first introduced, and more.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-diffs-alongside-the-commit-messages">See the diffs alongside the commit messages</h2>

<p>If you include the <code>-p</code> option (short for <code>--patch</code>) you get the full diff alongside the commit messages, giving you even more context and making it easier to spot the relevant changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-the-commit-that-first-added-some-code">Find the commit that first added some code</h2>

<p>Say you want to find the first commit that introduced a particular class, method or snippet of code. You can use the pickaxe combined with the <code>--reverse</code> option to get the commits in reverse-chronological order so the commit where the code first appears is listed at the top:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p --reverse
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-when-a-piece-of-code-was-deleted">Find when a piece of code was deleted</h2>

<p>Because the pickaxe search finds both additions and deletions, you can even use it to find code that has since been deleted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "deleted code" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming the snippet no longer exists in the codebase the first commit returned will be the one where it was removed.</p>

<h2 id="limit-the-scope-of-the-search">Limit the scope of the search</h2>

<p>Because we’re using <code>git log</code> you can also provide a path to focus the search to a given file or folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "some code" -p app/models/user.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="search-deeper-with-a-regular-expression">Search deeper with a regular expression</h2>

<p>I mostly stick to the pickaxe because I find working with regular expressions cumbersome, but if you want to perform a more advanced search using a regular expression you can do so with <code>-G</code> instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -G "REGEX HERE"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also worth noting that searching with <code>-S</code> has a subtle limitation that <code>-G</code> does not: <code>-S</code> only shows commits that either added or removed the search string. If the string you are searching for moved within the same file but was otherwise unchanged, <code>-S</code> won’t include that commit, whereas <code>-G</code> will.</p>

<h2 id="search-the-commit-messages-themselves">Search the commit messages themselves</h2>

<p>Sometimes searching for literal code is too narrow, or the information you’re after isn’t actually in the code but in the commit messages themselves. In which case you can use <code>--grep</code> to search commit messages instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log --grep "commit message search"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>Next time some code has you puzzled and you want to understand more about it, look beyond <code>git blame</code> and dig deeper into the history using the pickaxe and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the entire history of a snippet of code with <code>git log -S</code></li>
  <li>Include <code>-p</code> to see the diff as well as the commit messages</li>
  <li>Include <code>--reverse</code> to see the commit that introduced the code listed first</li>
  <li>Scope search to specific folders or files by including a path</li>
  <li>Search with a regular expression using <code>git log -G</code></li>
  <li>Search commit messages using <code>git log --grep</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Of course searching a codebase’s history will only be fruitful if the history itself is helpful. If the history hasn’t been constructed with atomic commits that have useful commit messages, searching it will likely be a frustrating and unhelpful experience.</p>

										                <p><em>A superresolution image of a group of killer T-cells (green and red) surrounding a cancer cell (blue, centre). Image: US NIH.</em></p>
<p>On World Cancer Day this year, Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, known in India for its cancer care facilities, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/exploring-new-options-in-cancer-care/article30729911.ece">announced</a> that it would study the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02161900">effects of yoga</a> on breast cancer patients. While the association between <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/regular-exercise-helps-patients-combat-cancer-67317">exercise and recovery</a> in cancer patients has been known since the 1990s, we know little about how this works on a molecular level.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59996">new study</a> shows that the key might lie in activating certain immune cells. The study, conducted by Randall Johnson and his team from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and the University of Cambridge, was the culmination of three years of research on what makes exercise good for cancer patients.</p>


<p>They first established that exercise could indeed decrease the growth of tumours. They induced tumours in mice, mimicking breast cancer in humans, and separated them into two groups: one exercised on running wheels and one did not. After a few days, the tumours had shrunk in the group that exercised but not in the sedentary group.</p>
<p>When the researchers examined blood samples from the mice, two things had dramatically increased after exercise: immune cells known as CD8+ T-cells and a compound called lactic acid.</p>
<p>The team first looked into CD8+ T-cells, which <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/the-ever-expanding-t-cell-world-a-primer-31123">defend against</a> tumours and infections. Did increased levels after exercise mean that the cells were involved in reducing tumour growth? To test this, the team removed CD8+ T-cells from tumour-bearing mice and then made them exercise. This time, exercising could not shrink the tumours: removing the T-cells also removed the positive effects of exercise.</p>
<p>“Then we did what, to my mind, is the coolest experiment in the paper,” said Johnson. They made mice exercise, carefully took CD8+ T-cells from them, and transplanted the cells into another set of mice that had tumours but didn’t exercise. To the scientists’ delight, simply transplanting CD8+ T-cells from mice that had exercised could shrink tumours in sedentary mice.</p>
<p>“The T-cells themselves are coming in ‘trained,’ making them better anti-tumour T-cells,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>What was ‘training’ the T-cells, though? That’s when the team turned their attention to lactic acid. After an intense bout of exercise, lactic acid is what makes your muscles feel like they’re burning. In the bloodstream, it circulates as lactate, its ionic form.</p>
<p>To mimic this form and the levels attained after exercise, the researchers injected sodium lactate into sedentary mice that had tumours. As with the T-cells, they found that daily injections of sodium lactate could shrink tumours and improve survival in these mice.</p>
<p>The team now knew that, through exercise, both lactate and CD8+ T-cells could reduce tumour growth. But this still didn’t explain how the two effects were linked.</p>
<p>To answer this, the scientists first checked whether lactate could independently activate CD8+ T-cells – and found that it could. Next, they again injected mice with lactate, only this time they removed the CD8+ T-cells from the mice. Without the T-cells, lactate injections could no longer lessen tumour growth.</p>
<p>“This shows that it’s really the lactate affecting the T-cells and helping them achieve a better anti-tumour effect,” Johnson said.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/why-everyone-around-you-seems-to-be-getting-cancer/">Why Everyone Around You Seems to Be Getting Cancer</a></ins></p>
<p>The study fills an important gap in our understanding of how exercise and the related metabolite changes boost anti-tumour the activities of our immune cells.</p>
<p>This said, “My main concern is that people should not think that only exercise can cure cancer,” S.V. Chiplunkar, a former director of the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Mumbai, and current head of its Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy division, cautioned.</p>
<p>“A combination of immunotherapy with supervised exercise or yoga regimens may yield significant benefits, but this needs to be tested in a randomised clinical trial.” Chiplunkar wasn’t involved in the study.</p>
<p>And as with any good study, this one spawned more questions than it answered. “Future studies should address how lactate levels are modulated in cancer patients/mice models in response [to] exercise,” Rajender Motiani, an assistant professor and DBT/Wellcome Trust India fellow at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad, said.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0485-4">recent study</a> in elite athletes showed that lactate is utilised by a unique class of gut microbiome, enhancing endurance and performance. It would be worth examining gut microbiota changes in cancer patients in response to exercise.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s team is now working out how much exercise is needed to boost T-cell activity. For example, one question they’re asking is if one hour of intense exercise could be better than two hours of light exercise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Helene Rundqvist, the study’s lead author, has been involved in a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02522260?term=exercise&amp;cond=Breast+Cancer&amp;cntry=SE&amp;city=Stockholm&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">clinical trial</a> assessing the effects of exercise on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The trial is still active and expected to be completed in 2022.</p>

Here is a summary of all the steps needed to set up the boilerplate<br>‍</p><p><em>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/07b99adf85538b5a90a0dcaa34de328c.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><h5><strong>Need for a virtual environment</strong></h5><p>While building any python applications, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install all the packages you need within this environment to keep them isolated from the rest of your machine. This not only ensures prevention of conflicts but also makes it easy to deploy this application anywhere you want.</p><p>Once this virtual environment is activated, your development environment is setup.</p><h5><strong>Creating a Django project</strong></h5><p>Once the virtual environment is created and the necessary python packages are installed, the boilerplate code you need can be created by using a nifty tool called django-admin. We will use this to create a project called <em>notesapp</em>. This not only creates the project structure but also configures a default SQLite database that you can use for the application. </p><p>This database is nothing but a single file created locally with the name <em>db.sqlite3</em> and is very handy to quickly prototype your application. You can change the database settings inside <em>settings.py</em> to point it to any database. This can be done later too once the basic functionality of your application is ready and works with SQLIte.</p><p>After your Django project is created, you also have to create a new Django app which we will use to define our models and APIs. Let's call this <em>notes. </em>Make sure to add this to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py</p><h3>Creating database models</h3><p>Before writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs, we must first create a database model on which we wish to perform the CRUD&nbsp;operations. Let us create a model called <em>Note </em>in notes/models.py.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/d5e29080d973326be371f0d03a5d23ef.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Before we proceed we must update the schema because a new database table needs to be created in the underlying database. This can be done by creating and running migrations</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE: https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/8234bd9ad41637718be8dca4dba04235.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</p><h3>Creating the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</h3><p>Now that the model has been created, we need a way to perform CRUD operations on this model by writing as little code as possible. This is where Django Rest Framework comes in. Not only can you expose CRUD&nbsp;APIs on this model within minutes, but you also get a pretty nifty user interface to view those APIs in action. </p><p>To do this, you must first define a serializer for the database model you created in the above step. <strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>Defining a serializer</strong></h5><p>A serializer is responsible for two things<br></p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>To validate an incoming create/update request and reject it if the fields are not in the format that is required to create/update an entry in the database table.</li><li>To convert a database table entry into a format like JSON&nbsp;that can be transferred over the internet to the client.</li></ol><p>Let us create a serializer in notes/serializers.py as follows.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4d69bb0c0de94789842fe9eb23e8e882.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Inside the Meta class, we define which database model is being serialized and what all fields within that model should be serialized. We could choose to include only certain fields from the model that we would like to expose over the API.</p><p>We can also define certain fields as <em>read_only</em> which indicates that these fields will be ignored if present in a create/update request but they will be present in the response a read request. </p><p>In this above case, is_active is responsible for indicating if a note has been deleted or not. Therefore we must not allow it to be modified via a create/update request and it should be set to false only when a delete operation is performed. This will become more clear in the upcoming steps. </p><p>We can also define fields as <em>write_only </em>which will indicate that these fields will not be present in a read response but we will allow the field to be modified in a create/update request. We can now proceed to writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</p><h5><strong>Defining an API&nbsp;View set</strong></h5><p>In Django, the APIs are written in views.py and each API&nbsp;that does some operation on a certain database resource is a view. In our case we will be performing multiple operations on the database model and hence what we need is a viewset. Here is how you define one in notes/views.py</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b313384c0774ec4f1dee342ced8ccc20.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br>‍<br>This viewset is now capable of performing all the CRUD&nbsp;operations and it will use the NoteSerializer to determine how the data will be received and how it will be sent back to the requesting client. <br></p><p>Since a read operation could be retrieving a single note or listing all the existing notes, we need a way to handle both cases. </p><p>The <em>get_object </em>is responsible to determine how an object is retrieved. In this case we look for an <em>id </em>field in the query parameters of a a request and use that to retrieve a note. </p><p>This method is also used while making an update operation because to update a particular note we would have to first retrieve that note.</p><p>The <em>get_queryset</em> method is responsible for determining how a list operation will work. In this case we will be listing all the notes which are still active and sort them in the decreasing order of the <em>last_udpated_on</em> timestamp.</p><p>The <em>perform_delete</em> method will determine what to do when a delete operation is requested. In this case we do not want to delete the row from the database and we simply want to deactivate it. Therefore we will be setting the <em>is_active</em> field to False and saving the note.</p><h5>‍<strong>Defining the URL&nbsp;path</strong>‍</h5><p>We just have one more step to complete before we can see our APIs in action and that is to determine what URL&nbsp;path will invoke the above viewset. This can be done in notesapp/urls.py as follows.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/902b7c23e95e3cb4ddf99f1b52bbbe52.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><div><p>‍</p><p>To explain what is going on here, we are basically saying that if the url <em>/note</em> is called, no matter what the HTTP&nbsp;method is, we will be invoking the NoteViewSet and based on what the HTTP method is we will call a particular method within this viewset.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><ol start="1" role="list"><li>A POST&nbsp;call will result in a create operation of the Note model.</li><li>A GET&nbsp;call will result in retrieving a single Note model object using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;call will result in replacing an existing Note model with a new Note and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A PATCH&nbsp;call will result in modifying only a certain field inside an existing Note model instead of entirely replacing it and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A DELETE&nbsp;call will result in calling a destroy function which internally calls the <em>perform_destroy</em> method defined above in views.py.</li></ol><p>In case you haven't noticed, there is one thing missing in this url PATH and that is the ability to list all the existing Note model objects. </p><p>To solve this I&nbsp;created another URL&nbsp;path <em>/note/all </em>where I am invoking the same viewset as the above one with the difference being the GET&nbsp;call will now invoke a list method on the viewset instead of a retrieve method which means that the <em>get_queryset </em>method defined earlier will be invoked.<br></p><h3>See your APIs in action<br></h3><p>Okay enough talk, let us now run the server and view the APIs in action. You can run the Django development server using the below command and it will expose your server on the 8000 port on localhost.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/473d335affb3426f7d5cbc1a747e4fe4.js&lt;/p&gt;</p></div><blockquote>Please do not forget to include <em>r…</em></blockquote></div></div>

<p>I am what I would call a non-famous public person. What do I mean by that? I mean that I have jobs where people publicly review my work. As a college instructor, I receive student reviews. Some of them get read internally at our school, and some of them get posted publicy. And they’re attached to my name. They’re not some product where people might just know my company or my brand. They know <em>me</em>, and they’re reviewing <em>me</em>. As an author, my books get reviewed. Some of those reviews are by editors and official reviewers internal to the publisher. Some of those reviews are by email. But most of those reviews are posted online. As a software developer and hobbyist podcaster I also get public reviews.</p>

<p>To anyone in a personalized creative field who cares deeply about their work, bad reviews hurt. It’s not just about being sensitive (although I am sensitive and that doesn’t help). It’s that when you really pour your heart into something, as I do my teaching for example, then the product is an extension of you. Nobody would deny that the way a class or a book turns out is an extension of the personality, knowledge, and ability of the teacher/author. And when the product is criticized, it’s like you are being criticized. </p>

<p>My dad, who was also a college instructor, and the producer of nine books and nine instructional videos among many other public creative ventures, had a very thin skin. He couldn’t stand me reading him a bad review. That stuck with me. This very accomplished man, couldn’t stand even a little criticism. When I get too sensitive, I try to remember how his inability to accept criticism hurt some of his products. He was much more about getting things done than doing them perfectly. If he had a little bit more of a perfectionist streak in him, he would have done even better. But maybe he would have done less…</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I receive eighteen great reviews for a class. It’s the words of the two bad reviews that stick with me. And do you know why? <em>Because almost always there’s a kernel of truth to those reviews.</em> Does that mean we should listen to them? Well if I only listened to the bad reviews, I would never produce anything. I would just stay in bed. The fact is the people who are getting no bad reviews, are the people who are not taking the risk of putting themselves out there. So, we have to not let ourselves get so discouraged that we stop producing. And we have to remember that while we may not have served those two students well, we may have served those other eighteen students better than they would have been served in a world without us teaching them. </p>

<p>We can’t please every student or every customer. Nothing that gets watched/read by more than a few people is going to be liked by all of them. Even Mother Theresa would get a downvote on YouTube. So, if we’re serving the majority, we don’t want to let the critiques of a few steer us in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being like my dad is dangerous too. <strong>No, the customer is not always right. But usually the customer has a point. We have to always be working to get better.</strong> Because we’re not perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. <strong>And we need to read those bad reviews to find those spaces for improvement.</strong> It doesn’t mean they’re right, but it does mean we need to think about them.</p>

<p>My dad accomplished an amazing amount. If he let those bad reviews slow him down too much, it’s very possible he would have not accomplished as much. But if he could have found a few tweaks, a few changes, to serve a few customers better, well then he could have grown through them. I want to grow, but I also don’t want to stop. So, I can’t let the reviews get me too down, but I have to read them.</p>

<p><strong>In this article, let’s learn to compute VMAF, PSNR, and SSIM using FFmpeg. While working on videos (compression or post-processing), it is common to compute objective metrics in addition to doing subjective Visual Quality testing. If you are using FFmpeg in your workflow, it is very easy to compute these metrics instead of purchasing expensive tools. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and take a look at these metrics and how they are computed, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is VMAF?</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMAF from Netflix</a></strong>&nbsp;stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p>



<p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. To understand how to install VMAF, please read our “<a href="https://ottverse.com/vmaf-ffmpeg-ubuntu-compilation-installation-usage-guide/">VMAF Installation</a>” article.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How to Compute VMAF using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways of computing VMAF. </p>



<p><strong>If your source and destination videos are of the same dimensions (height and width)</strong>, then you can directly compute the VMAF value using the command line below. </p>



<p>All you need to do is point FFmpeg to the location of the VMAF model file and it will do the rest. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="model_path=vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl":log_path=vmaf_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p><strong>However, in case the source and destination videos are not of the same resolution, then you have to ensure that the destination is brought to the same resolution as the source video before computing VMAF</strong>.</p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that uses the <code>filter_complex</code> to do the resolution change and then computes the VMAF value. I have used the <code>bicubic</code> filter to do the up/down scaling. </p>



<pre><code><code>bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mp4 -i test_1080p30.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; \</code>
<code>[main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json" \</code>
<code>-f null -</code></code></pre>



<p>The log file that is produced by the VMAF computation is very comprehensive. It provides a frame-wise score of VMAF and its constituent metrics, along with the aggregate score (if that’s all you are looking for). </p>



<p>Here is an example of the VMAF file. </p>

<h2>What is PSNR and How Is It Calculated?</h2>



<p>From Wikipedia, </p>



<p><em><strong>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated&nbsp;PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal</a>&nbsp;and the power of corrupting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise</a>&nbsp;that affects the fidelity of its representation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>So, for a video, you are essentially trying to compute how much noise or pixel corruption has been introduced due to the video compression process which is essentially lossy (mainly due to Quantization). </p>



<p>The first step is to compute the Mean Squared Error or MSE. The formula is shown below where I and K represent the original and destination images respectively and <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the height and width of the images respectively. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a34719b4f391dba26b3e8e4460b7595d62eece4" alt="{\mathit  {MSE}}={\frac  {1}{m\,n}}\sum _{{i=0}}^{{m-1}}\sum _{{j=0}}^{{n-1}}[I(i,j)-K(i,j)]^{2}"></p>



<p>Once you have the MSE, you can compute the PSNR using the formula shown below. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc22801ed1232ff1231c4156b589de5c32063a8a" alt="{\begin{aligned}{\mathit  {PSNR}}&amp;=10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}^{2}}{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}{{\sqrt  {{\mathit  {MSE}}}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}\right)-10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\end{aligned}}"></p>



<p>Here,&nbsp;<em>MAX<sub>I</sub></em>&nbsp;is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. </p>



<h2>How to Calculate PSNR using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to go through all those calculations while using FFmpeg. All you need to do use the filter module <code>lavfi</code> and tell it to compute the PSNR. That’s it. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi psnr=stats_file=psnr_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>FFmpeg will print the average PSNR on the console while the log file will contain a frame-wise list of the MSE and the PSNR for the Luma and Chroma planes (y, u, and v). An example is shown below – </p>



<pre><code>n:1 mse_avg:54.96 mse_y:72.51 mse_u:27.98 mse_v:11.74 psnr_avg:30.73 psnr_y:29.53 psnr_u:33.66 psnr_v:37.43 
 n:2 mse_avg:69.70 mse_y:93.80 mse_u:31.01 mse_v:12.02 psnr_avg:29.70 psnr_y:28.41 psnr_u:33.22 psnr_v:37.33 
 n:3 mse_avg:72.74 mse_y:98.37 mse_u:31.02 mse_v:11.96 psnr_avg:29.51 psnr_y:28.20 psnr_u:33.21 psnr_v:37.35 
 n:4 mse_avg:73.11 mse_y:98.94 mse_u:31.14 mse_v:11.76 psnr_avg:29.49 psnr_y:28.18 psnr_u:33.20 psnr_v:37.43 </code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>How to Calculate SSIM using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>Finally, let’s take a look at computing SSIM using FFmpeg. Again looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of SSIM</a>, </p>



<p><em><strong>The&nbsp;structural similarity&nbsp;index measure&nbsp;(SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Classification_of_objective_video_quality_metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reference metric</a>; in other words, the measurement or prediction of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image quality</a>&nbsp;is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.</strong></em></p>



<p>Calculating SSIM using FFmpeg is very similar to calcuating PSNR. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi ssim=stats_file=ssim_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>The output of this command is going to look like this – </p>



<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 0000029c82894300] SSIM Y:0.926845 (11.357537) U:0.876798 (9.093807) V:0.860658 (8.559193) All:0.907472 (10.337287)</code></pre>



<p>And the log file will give you information on the SSIM values for each of the planes (Y, U, and V) along with the aggregate for each of the frames of the video. </p>



<pre><code> n:1 Y:0.930033 U:0.926453 V:0.913508 All:0.926682 (11.347897)
 n:2 Y:0.919140 U:0.915343 V:0.910900 All:0.917134 (10.816226)
 n:3 Y:0.922417 U:0.915795 V:0.910959 All:0.919404 (10.936853)
 n:4 Y:0.920077 U:0.916443 V:0.912994 All:0.918291 (10.877300)
 n:5 Y:0.926438 U:0.927597 V:0.917905 All:0.925209 (11.261518)
 n:6 Y:0.920619 U:0.919988 V:0.918780 All:0.920207 (10.980375)</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>That’s it folks – now you know how to calculate three very important objective metrics for video quality evaluation — PSNR, VMAF, and SSIM. By computing all three and using them for analysis, it’s hard to be thrown off by artifacts that one metric can catch and the other can’t. </p>



<p>And like always, do spend a few minutes doing some visual testing (subjective) after you’re done with the objective scores! </p>

<p>Do you hate writing? Me too.</p>



<div><p>I am not talking about tweets or IG posts. I’m talking about 500 word long articles and essays. Most of us don’t like writing them. They take too much time and effort. </p><p>But is time really the problem? I don’t think so. We spend a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank">lot of time</a> on social media everyday right? Yeah time is not the problem.</p></div>



<p>So is effort the problem? Hmm let’s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in? For me it does. </p>







<p>See, when I plan to write an article, usually I have a general idea about the topic I plan to write about. Though as soon as I open a blank page, my ideas start ruffling among each other making a mess. I don’t have clarity anymore. Everything starts falling apart, anxiety kicks in and …. I close the tab. Phew too much trouble for a few likes. </p>







<p>But after a few days / weeks those ideas start dying. The worst part is I see them dying without seeing the light of the day. That sucks. </p>



<p>And that’s why I try to write, and you should too.</p>



<p>Writing about a topic gives me a platform to just lay my ideas wide in the open. It’s like clearing my mental hard drive. It feels relaxing. </p>



<p>But If I just pour my random thoughts on a piece of paper that’s just writing, not <em>good</em> writing. I don’t want people to see a mishmash of ill shaped ideas, I want them to see a well ordered architecture where every part fits in. It’s not just for the sake of readers though, It’s for the ideas themselves. </p>



<p>Often about a topic, I have a range of musings. They’re like vectors, each with their own direction and magnitude. They make sense individually but to understand about the topic as a whole, all of them need to come in sync. Their rhythm has to match. That’s what good writing does. </p>



<blockquote><p>Good writing is just clear thinking expressed on paper.</p></blockquote>



<p>Writing about a topic makes me think about it from all the directions and perspectives. </p>



<p><em>What do I know about this topic?</em></p>



<p><em>Do I know enough?</em></p>



<p><em>If everything I know, correct?</em></p>



<p><em>How can I fill my gaps?</em></p>







<p>Jotting down everything I know helps me answer many of these questions. The ones still unanswered force me to research more. It’s a cycle.</p>



<p>Each draft of writing takes me one step closer to the complete and clear picture. The ultimate truth starts showing itself in the end. It’s a bliss moment.</p>



<p>The learning readers get is always a pleasant <em>byproduct</em>. </p>







<p>As one of my favorite writer <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Julian</a> says, </p>



<blockquote><p>The best writing is therapy that you publish for the world to learn from.</p></blockquote>







<p>After self-learning and expression, what is the next best thing writing offers?</p>



<p><strong>Relationships</strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Writing online is a superpower.</p><p>Here’s a list of people who should start writing online.</p><p>1. The Niche Hobbyist</p><p>The Internet rewards people with obscure interests. Writing online will help you find other like-minded hobbyists who you wouldn’t be able to find in real-life.</p></div>— David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612675334660099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<div><p>Writing online helps you create meaningful relationships, sometimes even indirectly. When people read well written articles, they can’t stop but appreciate the coherent thinking of the writer. These artifacts demonstrate author’s expertise in the given topic and hence increase their visibility.</p><p>Internet is a great place, good content can reach thousands of people with zero marketing. </p></div>



<blockquote><p>“By making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity.” – <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell">@david_perell</a></p></blockquote>



<p>This visibility can get you job offers, network of influential people, money and many other things. </p>



<div><p>I can go on and on about the benefits of putting yourself out there but it’s a moo point. You have to experience the magic yourself. When a stranger thanks you for a piece of advice or a someone asks if they can use your work, it feels great. </p><p>Not trying to brag here but even as a crappy writer myself, I have experienced the joy of someone reaching out to me to thank me for my work. You should too!</p></div>

      <div>
        <article>
          <section><p>Earlier this year I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to have as an AArch64
development machine. The fastest way to get familiar with an
instruction set is to write a disassembler for it and I’ve made one
for 64-bit <span>ARM</span> in R6RS Scheme as part of
the <a href="https://github.com/weinholt/machine-code">machine-code</a> project.
The instruction set is called <span>ARM</span> A64, instructions are always 32 bits
wide and they have a neat structure which is pretty fast to decode in&nbsp;software.</p>

<p>The architecture has 31 integer registers (x0-x30). There is also a
stack pointer register and a zero register that always contains
zeroes. Both these registers are encoded as register number 31, and
it’s up to each instruction if an operand can use the stack pointer or
the zero register. The x30 register is used to store the return
address. These registers are all 64-bit registers and the lower 32
bits can be accessed using the names w0-w31. Operations that write to
the lower 32 bits also clear the upper 32 bits, just like on&nbsp;<span>AMD64</span>.</p>
<p>There are also 32 registers usable as either floating point registers
or 128-bit vector registers. As vectors they support different
arrangements that are either 64 or 128 bits in total, containing
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit quantities. There are many
instructions that operate on multiple quantities at the same time,
which is an interesting way to speed up code. Multiple loop iterations
can be run&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<p>The instructions are documented in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/a/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile"><span>ARM</span> ARM for ARMv8-A</a>. I’ve
counted, not including instruction aliases, 442 instruction mnemonics
(things like <span>ADD</span>, EOR, B.EQ, etc). They are organized in what is
basically a four-level table: main encoding, instruction group, decode
group and instruction. Chapter C4 of the manual follows the same
structure. This structure is nice for fast decoding, but it’s not
strictly necessary since all encodings at the instruction level still
need to have a unique&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>For each instruction mnemonic there can be multiple variants that
enable the instruction to handle different types of operands. An
example of this is the <span>FMUL</span> instruction that multiples two floating
point values. In a C program it would look like <code>a = b * c</code>. In A64
assembler it might look like one of these, depending on what the
surrounding code&nbsp;does:</p>
<pre><code><span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>d2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>4</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>d   
<span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]       
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>] 
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few variants for a single mnemonic. Not all mnemonics
have this many variants, but depending on how one counts I estimate
that there are in total around 1000-2000 variants. The instruction set
designers had to fit all these variants into 32 bits, while at the
same time making space for instructions that encode relatively large
immediate operands, and not forgetting about leaving space for future
extensions. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the instructions
should also be easy to decode with&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I’ve extracted the tables from my disassembler, rendered them with
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-field">bit-field package</a>, and
made them slightly interactive. If you’re reading this in a browser
you can see the encodings below. The thing to notice is that each
layer adds extra fixed bits: fields that must be a fixed 0 or 1 value.
(The last level, the instruction level, is not shown in this table).
Two encodings under the same parent always have some differences in
these fields, so that they can be separated by an instruction decoder.
Click an encoding to expand the next level of&nbsp;encodings.</p>




<p>There are many conventions in the field names. Instructions that take
register operands encode them in fields named <em>Rd</em>, <em>Rn</em> and <em>Rm</em>.
Immediate values (integers, <span>PC</span>-relative offsets, etc) are named <em>imm</em>.
Fields that change the type of operation tend to be called <em>op</em>N or
<em>opcode</em>. In general a few of the fields encode the operation (or the
size of the operation) and the rest encode the&nbsp;operands.</p>

<p>The image below shows the encoding space of the instruction set. The
<em>x</em> axis goes from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 and encodes the lower 16 bits
of the instruction space, and the <em>y</em> axis contains the upper 16 bits.
The different colors denote different decode groups, i.e. all the
encodings at the third level of the table above. (There is probably a
better&nbsp;representation).</p>
<p><img src="https://weinholt.se/articles/arm-a64-instruction-set/a64-2048-crushed.png" title="Encoding space used by ARM A64" alt="An image showing the 32-bit
  encoding space. Mostly there are horizontal thick lines of different
  colors. This shows that the higher 16 bits tend to keep similar
  instructions together, although there is some mirroring around the
  middle of the image."></p>
<p>All the dark spots are places where ARMv8 does not have any allocated
instructions, or the encoding is reserved. For many instructions there
are some fields that have reserved encodings and these are also&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>Even if instructions are kept to the fixed 32 bit encoding there is
still plenty of room for the instruction set to&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p><span>ARM</span> A64 is a quite clean instruction set with only a few quirks here
and there in its encoding. Compared to AMD64 it has twice the amount
of registers, a clean separation of load/store instructions, clean
RISCy operands (mostly one destination register and two source
registers) and of course the register names and most mnemonics are
totally different. Both have 128-bit vector registers and 64-bit
integer registers and a 64-bit address space. They look quite similar,
except everything’s&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The why of why people use vim has been <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/why-i-use-vim-2f40">covered fairly extensively</a>, so I thought I would spend a little time explaining why I <em>teach</em> vim to my high school students, even in 2020.</p>



<p>It all began when I was assigned a mixed class of ninth through twelfth grade students in computer science just after the financial collapse on 2008. Well, the financial collapse first brought me to teach Intro to Programming using VB 6.0 and Windows thin clients, which was an experience unto itself (thanks in part to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker virus</a>). That experience is worth a separate blog post and is a good part of why one of my specialties is teaching computer security.</p>



<p>So here I am with all levels of student, including AP CS A (read: AP CS Java), and obsolete Windows PCs (at least the thin clients were gone). I couldn’t install any software, wanted to teach C, had to teach Java, and had very few options (these were the days before online web based IDEs).</p>



<p>I had experience with the UNIX command line, primarily Sun Workstations, thanks to my wonderful education at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">UCSC</a>, so that wasn’t an issue. I had played with Linux in the 1990s to a bit of success, but hadn’t touched it for almost a decade. So I found an old Pentium 2 carcass in the the garbage outside my condo complex, installed a hard drive, and tried this new (to me) flavor of Linux called, strangely, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>



<p>I quickly realized this machine could have all the students coding at one, discovered the wonder that is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty.exe</a> (it doesn’t require any installation to run!) to connect the obsolete PCs to the server and soon my students were off and coding.</p>



<p>Why did I teach them vim? I wish I could say I agonized over all the options at the time and decided vim was the best pedagogical solution, but the reality of the situation was that vi was what I used in college because my father taught me vi. You see, I am lucky to have a father who worked in the industry and is even somewhat of a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">footnote in text editor history</a>. So I taught vi (later vim) because it is what I knew. A running theme in many computer science teacher’s trials by fire… teaching something because it is what they know. I will go as far as to argue that it is more important that the teacher knows the editor, and especially the programming language, rather than assigning any importance to one correct editor or one correct language that all teachers should teach.</p>



<p>Years later, though, I still teach vim and the command line. So here is how I justify my decision, even if only to myself.</p>



<p>It just works. Every time I go to a new school, it takes time to get the software installed necessary to run IDEs. I remember walking into one school in which the AP CS A class was flailing away with Eclipse on Mac OS X because the students needed, and didn’t have, administrator access. I have an amazing tech department at my current job, but even here it took us weeks to figure out how to deploy Visual Studio Code on the student’s MacBook Airs and then we had to figure out how to deploy Python3 and Java. So there’s no confusion, I teach vim along with many IDEs and I fully believe it is my responsibility to teach multiple platforms and multiple IDEs, but the CLI and vim are always my safety net.</p>



<p>My students can program in any number of of languages on a now cloud based CLI Linux machine (thank you <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – both of whom offer a $5/month plan – just. happy customer!). By using the CLI, I can support literally any type of computer connecting (including iPads, although the lack of a virtual esc key drives me batty as a vim user, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">ChromeBooks</a>). Students can connect from anywhere in the world and things just work. All of this became infinitely important in the remote and hybrid learning experience of the pandemic. And this is all possible because the students use vim.</p>



<p>I keep track of as many of my students that major in CS and a running theme is they all profusely thank me for teaching them vim and the CLI. Too many colleges start CS1 with an IDE and then throw the CS2 students into the deep end with the CLI. Not everyone is as lucky as I was in regards to having a father well versed in the CLI.</p>



<p>And yes, there are online IDEs these days, but I’ve found those to be full of their own pitfalls, privacy issues, and costs and find doing any advanced work using them to be very difficult if not impossible.</p>



<p>Also, to be clear, both nano and Emacs work quite well in the context of CLI Linux and I don’t make any claim that teachers should use vim over those equally acceptable command line text editors except for one small argument. Most people agree, computer security pretty much requires knowledge of the command line and a text editor. I always tell my students that the one editor they are likely to find already installed on a machine is vim and it is a bad day when you have to install another editor. Maybe just an issue for students interested in ethical penetration testing…</p>

<p>In 2007, just after his cancer diagnosis, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">a well received lecture on Time Management</a>. These are my notes (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">slides here</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">transcript here</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Side note - he is better known for his Last Lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a> - ironically given <em>before</em> this Time Management talk.</p>

  <h2 id="money-vs-time"><a href="#money-vs-time">Money vs Time</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We are very good at dealing with money, but very bad at dealing with time. Having an idea of how much your time costs helps you start making tradeoffs better.</li>
    <li>We have to manage our time better than we manage our money. We have money budgets, what about time budgets?</li>
    <li>We are in a "Time Famine" - nobody says they have "too much time". Yet The typical office worker wastes almost 2 hrs a day at work, and 28 hours a week on TV. This isn't just a one-off problem - you can't solve it one week and then go back to normal - it's systemic and requries change in fundamental processes to address this once and for all.</li>
    <li>The goal is to have fun, be happier, lead a more meaningful life. If you're not going to have fun, why do it?</li>
    <li>Being successful doesn't make you manage your time well. Managing your time well does make you successful.</li>
    <li>Turn money into time - Hire someone to do chores. Esp if you have kids.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Always ask: Why am I doing this, What is the goal? Why will I succeed? What will happen if I don't do it?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>It's more important to do the right things, rather than do things right.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pareto Principle, 80/20 rule. Focus on the high value/impact things.</p>
    </li>

      <p>People asked Walt how he built Disneyland in 366 days. His reply: "We used every one of them."</p>

      <p><strong>Planning is impt</strong>. Failing to plan = planning to fail. Have a plan for day/week/quarter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can still be fluid - plans can change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Todos</strong> - Break things down into small steps. "Get tenure" is not a todo. Eat your frog - do the ugliest thing first.</p>

      <p><strong>Prioritization</strong> (MOST IMPORTANT) Covey/Eisenhower Matrix</p>

        <li>urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>not urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>the trick is to not do unimportant things, and to tackle important things <strong>before</strong> they become urgent.</li>

      <p>Keep your desk clear - have 1 thing on your desk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Touch each piece of paper, email once. <strong>Inbox is not your todo list</strong>. File the email away and put it on your todo list.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A filing system is absolutely essential. Have one place in the house where any piece of paper goes. (Ditto in the cloud/computer)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Have at least two, maybe three monitors.</strong> Using just one "is like eating off the airplane tray."</p>

        <li>Inbox</li>
        <li>Calendar. Dont use your brain to remember your appointments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Standing during phone calls - will be much faster. Don't get comfortable. "I'd love to keep talking with you but I have students waiting."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Exercise on bike - can be spent on phone if you have a headset</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Write a Thank You note. Tangible way of telling someone you appreciated something. It makes you rare, they remember you well.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The dog - reminds you you have better things to do</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Chair - make your office comfortable for you, optionally comfortable for others (eg folding chair).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You do not find time to do something, you make time.</strong> And you make time by electing not to do something else.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Learn to say no.</strong> Opportunity cost is real. "Gentle no" = "I'll be your backup". "If you need an 8th person I'll be there."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your creative time and defend it ruthlessly. It varies for people - could be 10pm-Midnight.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your dead time and do stuff where you don't need to be at your best.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Interruption</strong> takes 6-9mins, but recovery takes 4-5mins. Got to find ways to reduce frequency of interruptions. Turn phone calls into emails. Batch interactions with other people.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Giving hints to cut meetings short: Get up, walk to the door, thank them, shake their hand. Walk them out of the room.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Time journals</strong> - monitor and update thru the day. <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Events/News/VirtuousReality/">Fred Brooks had actual time clocks</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Look at open blocks where you know you are going to be wasting time, as gaps between blocks - make up a fake class.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Delegate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>"How am I wasting other people's time?"</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You become more efficient at work so you can leave on time and spend it with the people you love. Once you have kids the stakes are real.</p>

    <li>Sometimes you want to avoid Parkinson's Law - Work expands to fill the time available for it.</li>
    <li>But key realization - doing things at the last minute is very expensive. If you push things up to the deadline that's where all the stress comes from</li>
    <li>Make a fake deadline and pretend it is real.</li>

        <li>Specific date/time</li>
        <li>Specific penalty/reward</li>

    </li>
    <li>Challenge people: delegate until they complain</li>
    <li>Communication has to be CLEAR - and written</li>
    <li>Don't tell them HOW to do it - tell them what you need done, let them come up with solutions. This is how to work with people smarter than you.</li>
    <li>Offer relative importance - so people know what order to do them in</li>

      <p>He often uses humor - noting the optimistic side of his very grim situation, giving some relief to his audience while also reminding them of the importance of his message.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He is also extremely respectful - being humble to specific members of the audience ("Gabe is REALLY in good shape", "I am NOT smarter than Jim Calhoun", "Am I giving a talk with Alf Weaver in the audience?"), as well as the venue/general audience itself ("there aren't many better PhD programs in history than this one").</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He brings in personal stories and examples, often involving his wife, and they are usually relatable and funny. His slides use photos from his own life living the things he talks about.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The anecdotes also inject some variety - 40 minutes in he breaks for a tangent about his dog and a tiny debate he had with his wife.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Vocal variation - 53 minutes in he screams "PUT THE CIGARETTE OUT MOM" and that is a nice spike in decibels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ending is really good: He ends with actionable things to do, and a nice reminder of why this is important:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If I haven't changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you'll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that's important, time is all we have. And you may find one day, you have less than you think."</p>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance could <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/oneill-rpt-amr/">cost the world $100 trillion by 2050</a>, and approximately kills 700,000 per year. Some in the scientific community say it could be as bad as cancer. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768623/">principal public health problems</a> of the 21st century. The World Health Organisation published <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed">a list of bacteria of which new antibiotics are urgently needed</a>, and superbug “Staph” was Priority high. It’s a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25498-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-now-a-global-epidemic/">global epidemic</a>.</p>



<p>We should be rational optimists, as Matt Ridley explains with evidence in his book. Through science and technology the world gets better via our collective brain.</p>



<p><a href="https://botanixpharma.com/">Botanix Pharmaceuticals</a> (Botanix) has made a scientific breakthrough. In September 2020, Botanix proved its product&nbsp; BTX 1801 kills superbug Staph (aka MRSA or golden Staph) without allowing resistance to develop. <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200908/pdf/44mf662gw8dbkd.pdf">It was done in human skin</a>. This product is designed for Surgical Site Infections (SSI) which costs hospitals US$10 billion per year. The Phase 2a study is due in Q4 2020. They did this a year after they <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20190801/pdf/4473szphv8b084.pdf">raised US$40 million at a valuation of US$198 million</a>.</p>



<p>There was already evidence Cannabidiol (CBD) was antibacterial, which is used in the product. This new data supports bigger studies for a potential new antibiotic. There is a big need for new antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance. The problem is that it is very hard to make these scientific breakthroughs. Botanix has made a breakthrough for the world, and the data will be used by other scientists to save lives. Botanix also has a cash runway to take its clinical pipeline to December 2021 (excluding FDA approved Phase 3 Acne).</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">approximately 27 million</a> surgical procedures in the U.S per year. Approximately 5% get infected, which leads to 1.35 million SSI’s per year in the U.S. Occurrence of SSI is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7 to 10 days and add over <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">$3,000 in costs of care</a>. Globally, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5435b2b9e4b0e1fd29fa9d26/t/5aa2b3374192023932fb6690/1520612157567/Surgical%26AnaesthesiaDataReport.pdf">there are approximately 313 million</a> surgical procedures per year. If 5% of surgical procedures lead to infections, that’s 15.6 million SSI’s globally.</p>



<p>In the U.S there are 1.35 million SSI’s per year, multiply that by $3,000 costs, and it equals $4 billion. SSI’s cost U.S hospitals $4 billion per year. If BTX 1801 is priced at $100, that equals $135 million yearly revenue in the U.S – a huge drop in hospital costs. Presume the product will last 10 years, and that equals $1.3 billion in revenue. Globally, potential annual revenue could be $1.5 billion (SSI’s multiplied by the $100 price).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is 1 of 3 products in the Botanix clinical pipeline. Pending studies are FDA approved <a href="http://marksita.com/botanix-pharmaceuticals">Phase 3 Acne</a> and Phase 2 Rosacea.</p>



<p>A recent study found it costs on average <a href="https://amr.solutions/2020/03/06/what-does-an-antibiotic-cost-to-develop-what-is-it-worth-how-to-afford-it/">$1.3 billion to get a new drug approved</a>. By using synthetic Cannabidiol, Botanix is able to make significantly better drugs. Botanix has a competitive advantage, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">FDA Fast Track Status</a> application (due to the <a href="https://smallcaps.com.au/botanix-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-grant-antibacterial-product-btx-1801/">FDA Qualified Infectious Disease Product</a> status) will make it stronger.</p>



<p>Antibiotics is the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/antibiotics-dilemma-running-out-of-drugs-to-treat-superbugs/7281438">$40 billion drug market</a> that no company wants a part of. <strong>Until now.</strong></p>
