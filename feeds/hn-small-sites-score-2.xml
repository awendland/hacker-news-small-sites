<p><strong>Link</strong>: https://logolix.com/</p>



<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Joven Babovic</p>



<p><strong>Revenue</strong>: $4k MRR</p>



<p><strong>Product</strong>: “Free logo design for your projects.”</p>



<p><strong>Who is Joven Babovic and what business he started?</strong></p>



<p>Joven Babovic is a brand designer from Belgrade, Serbia. He is working on a productized logo design agency for tech founders, called Logolix, which starts three years ago.</p>



<p><strong>What is the backstory behind logolix and how he comes up with the idea?</strong></p>



<p>Back from 2012 to 2017, Joven is doing freelancing and participating in the design competition. But the competition on this platform is rapidly increasing, so he decided to start his agency. Logo design is a passion for Joven. But the problem is that compony only need new look ones every few years. That’s why he needs to find a new client after every work done. But he needs a steady stream of leads.</p>



<p>He analyzed the market and start plan what to do next and came up with an idea to give his some logo design for free. As he was designing the logo for three years and every client need 3-4 logos to choose the good one. However, after taking the best logos, the other logo is still unused, so he used that logos for people who were testing their ideas but don’t have money to spend on good looking logo’s. And give it free for them, hoping that they would come back and order a custom design later.</p>



<p>And this work for Joven is a stream of clients for three years without any additional marketing.</p>



<p><strong>How Joven came up with the prototype of his idea?</strong></p>



<p>Joven takes two weeks to create it’s the initial product.<br>He used a theme from ThemeForest as he is not a developer, but he has a good knowledge of customizing ThemeForest themes. Other then theme he purchased a domain and hosting which cost him around $100.</p>



<p>Here are the full steps involved in the two weeks of making initial product<br>1 Sort out best logos and package them for easy download.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>Write down landing page copy and created three different pricing packages</li><li>Customize the theme to match Logolix branding and add all of the logos</li><li>Create the design brief and integrate Typeform into the website.</li><li>Upload the website and make sure everything is functioning correctly (Google Analytics, Typeform, Download feature, Contact form, etc.)</li><li>Prepare the images and copy to launch on Product Hunt</li><li>Launch!</li></ol>



<p>He didn’t spend too much time on MVP and focused on the product’s back end and delivering exceptional service.</p>



<p><strong>Since launch what worked for Jovan to attract customers for logolix</strong>.</p>



<p>Joven knows the importance of freemium model people wanted to try something before they purchased it and that realize Joven that founders didn’t want to spend money on a new logo when just testing their ideas.</p>



<p>For getting customers, he researched where tech founders spend their time online, and that’s when he found product hunt. He saw many products are launching on product hunt, but the competition for logo design category didn’t have much competition.</p>



<p>And after a few days later Joven launched Logolix on Producthunt<br>And go to sleep after wake up he saw 11 new inquiries and Logolix got #1 product of the day with 780 upvotes. Logolix got 12000 visits, but the traffic is slowly died off in the next month.</p>



<p>Other then that referral is the most significant source of new clients for logolix.</p>



<p>Logolix started as a side hustle, and Joven doesn’t have any plan to scale it as it only provides additional income and allow him to work on projects that he likes to enjoy.</p>



<p><strong>Joven future plans with logolix</strong></p>



<p>Joven wants to write a guest post for getting extra exposure for logolix.</p>



<p>Other than that Joven wants to start a unique productized service soon.</p>



<p><strong>Through starting Logolix what challenges Joven faced. And how he overcome those.</strong></p>



<p>The first mistake Joven did is that he get too excited after launch and after checking 12 orders, as he gets one to three clients per month, after seeing 12 orders at once, he gets a burden. He cancelled some order and worked with good earning potential orders if he takes all order and finds a good designer of its level to scale logolix to a different story.</p>



<p>The second mistake was to redesigning logolix landing page several time, which got him to bounce rate.<br>Here Is the lesson: don’t make massive changes if something is already working, just because you think it will work even better. Follow the data and try to improve your product step-by-step slowly.</p>



<p><strong>Through starting Logolix what Joven learn which is particularly helpful or advantages for him?</strong></p>



<p>I can’t pinpoint specific advice that helped me, but immersing myself in digital marketing content and the SaaS world gave me many insights. I wouldn’t have even thought of promoting my logos by giving them away for free if there wasn’t a SaaS article about freemiums.</p>



<p><strong>Advice from Joven for future entrepreneurs who were starting?</strong></p>



<p>Just start something. You don’t learn until you launch and nothing will be as you planned. You might fail bad, but take it as a lesson. You might also succeed beyond your wildest predictions.<br>Everything is about the mindset, and this cannot be overstated. I used to be a wantrepreneur and never thought that I could somehow scale my skills beyond selling $200 logos. Start believing in yourself and follow what people on the next level are doing. Don’t copy, but emulate.</p>



<p>One more piece of advice for anyone in the creative profession is to read Steven Pressfield’s work. I used to continually battle with procrastination until his books showed me a way out. If you struggle to start a new project or wait until the deadline to complete a task, resistance beats you. You have to learn how to overcome it if you want to achieve something great. Anyways, he’ll explain it much better than me.</p>

      <p><a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html">Linux is not a secure operating system</a>. However, there are steps you can take to improve it. This guide aims to explain
      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>
      
      DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy,
      not performance, usability, or anything else. </p><p>

    </p></div>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to

  <p>
    In software development, communicating productively is as important as
    writing quality code quickly. Maybe even more important - studies show that
    most problems in software projects are in fact communication problems.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="why-focus-on-communication">
    <a href="#why-focus-on-communication">Why focus on communication?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    On the Internet, you can find many articles and studies about
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+software+projects+fail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      why software projects fail
    </a>. They cite different reasons, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lack of understanding of business needs;</li>
    <li>Vague or poorly communicated requirements;</li>
    <li>Unrealistic timelines or expectations;</li>
    <li>False belief that scope can be defined upfront;</li>
    <li>Inadequate planning;</li>
    <li>Too many or too few people assigned to a project;</li>
    <li>Poor reporting of project status;</li>
    <li>Unmanaged risks;</li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you look closer, you'll notice that these reasons point to one thing in
    common: a disconnect between management and developers. So removing this
    disconnect should yield great returns.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">
    <a href="#does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">Does it mean we should talk more?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What would improve communication between developers and management? This is
    a broad topic, but one idea's obvious: they must communicate frequently
    enough to be on the same page about goals, requirements, priorities, work
    progress, project challenges, and risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates another problem though: to be productive, developers need
    prolonged periods of quiet time. They need to do focused work, without
    distractions. Meetings distract developers from writing code. And waiting
    for the meeting can be even worse. If people know they'll be interrupted
    soon, they'll feel discouraged from starting anything big. Paul Graham
    wrote a great article about this -
    <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, so on one hand we need to talk to developers, but on the other we
    shouldn't distract them so much that they can't be productive. Finding this
    delicate balance may be hard, but we can make the job easier by removing
    trivial questions from the discussion. Below I'll give some examples of how
    well organized processes and technology can help us talk less, but do more.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">
    <a href="#stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">Stop asking who's working on what</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    One such trivial question is “Who's working on what?” Isn't that what the
    task tracker's for? All task trackers incorporate concepts like Assignee
    and Status. When tasks are accurately assigned with up-to-date statuses,
    you'll have immediate visibility about who's working on what and how long
    they've been working on it. Besides that, you may occasionally need to
    return to old completed tasks. Having an accurate task history helps you
    return easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though task tracking sounds simple, in practice it requires a manager's
    effort to keep your task tracker in good shape. People may forget to switch
    task statuses, or assign tasks to themselves. Someone might not have a task
    in progress at all. Someone else might have multiple tasks in progress,
    which once again, doesn't tell us what exactly they're working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created these "In progress"
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/notification-types/">notifications</a>
    in Teamplify:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="No issues in progress" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Teamplify connects to your task tracker, like Jira or Trello. If it's not
    clear what developers are working on, it will politely ask, in Slack or
    over email, to update their task status. These notifications are smart and
    unobtrusive. They also take all kinds of non-working days into
    consideration, so they won't disturb your teammates on their vacation.
    More on that later.
  </p>

  
  
  <h2 id="make-work-progress-visible">
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Make work progress visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Today, almost every development team uses at least some version of these
    collaboration tools:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>code hosting - for example, GitHub or GitLab;</li>
    <li>task tracker - Jira, Trello, or similar;</li>
    <li>chat - many teams use Slack;</li>
    <li>video conferencing software, such as Zoom.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These tools are usually shared with the whole team, so any team member can
    take a look and learn something about work progress. Unfortunately,
    looking over each tool is not a convenient way to learn what the team has
    been busy on. Because the information is fragmented, not everyone will be
    willing to dig through it. It's much easier to ask about the status in a
    meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created the Team Calendar view, which collects all the work
    activity from your team tools and puts it in one place. It also shows
    national holidays, vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a>:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Team Calendar" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar displays the most important types of team work activity,
    including code commits, task updates, and communication over video and chat.
    It also automatically detects when someone mentions a task in chat messages
    and code commits. For example, if a task was discussed somewhere in Slack,
    you'll see it, and be able to click directly to that discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Better visibility into work progress means better informed managers, with
    less need for meetings and less developer distractions.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="make-time-off-visible">
    <a href="#make-time-off-visible">Make time-off visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Time off plays an important role in short-term project planning. Even in
    small organizations, people don't always remember who's going on vacation
    next week. And if your team is distributed, it's quite easy to forget about
    other country's national holidays.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone's absence is a surprise, it's not good for your project.
    Making time-off clearly visible helps people better plan around it.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we added time-off management to Teamplify. National holidays,
    vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a> are visible on the
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Team Calendar</a> mentioned above.
    You can also configure notifications for Slack or email:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Sick day notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if people miss the notification and mention someone who is absent
    today, Teamplify will politely remind them:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Time off friendly reminder" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also request a vacation or add another status via the Teamplify
    Slack bot, so you can manage off time without leaving Slack.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="identify-stuck-progress">
    <a href="#identify-stuck-progress">Identify stuck progress</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Even the best and brightest developers get stuck sometimes. There may be an
    unexpected technical problem, or maybe the task turns out to be more
    difficult than previously thought. In such cases, brainstorming with
    colleagues may help find a solution or an alternative path and boost the
    progress significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we haven't seen any code activity from a developer in a while, it
    doesn't necessarily mean that they're stuck, but it might signal a good
    time to check if everything's alright.
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="No recent commits notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Stuck communication is just another form of stuck progress. This could be a
    lengthy discussion without any productive decision. More often, it's just a
    question that's been waiting too long for an answer:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Pending questions notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    If a bot can politely remind your correspondent about your pending
    question, it means you don't have to. Besides that, bot notifications are
    sometimes better perceived. If a person reminds you every day about pending
    questions, it might be annoying. But if a bot does the same - it's probably
    okay, because, you know, it's just a bot.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="bottom-line">
    <a href="#bottom-line">Bottom line</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    When communication improvements add up, the result is a more productive
    work environment, where people are better informed and spend less time on
    discussing trivial questions. We have a lot of complex problems to solve,
    let's focus on them instead.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><main><article role="article"><div><p>In a previous life, I was an electronic music designer working on Broadway shows in New York City. Broadway shows look glamorous and expensive on the outside, but it’s often quite the opposite on the inside –&nbsp;at least for the music department. One of the toughest parts of my job as an electronic music designer was to find the best performance-to-cost ratio for computer rigs powering keyboards, guitars, playback tracks, and more.</p><p>Over the past decade, Broadway has replaced large sections of traditional orchestras with synthesizers, playback systems, and electronic drum pads. I’m not in support of that, but that’s a story for another day. The point here is that Broadway’s reliance on computer-driven rigs has increased, while the typical budget required to build high-end stable rigs hasn’t increased at the same rate.</p><p>Some shows I’ve worked at set aside a $10,000-$12,000 budget for two keyboard rigs. That sounds like a lot of money at first, but it’s not. For live shows, it’s usually best to have a 1:1 backup in case the main rig fails. That fact alone means you have to design a rig that fits within 50% of the proposed budget. Furthermore, a high-quality keyboard controller alone is $1,500-2,000 –&nbsp;so that means there’s $3,000 left for a computer and everything else.</p><p>Due to budget constraints, many shows end up using Mac minis. Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.</p><p>Apple Silicon changes everything for Broadway electronic music designers. The new M1 Mac mini is capable of running high-end sample libraries and virtual instruments in a stable manner, and it’s only going to get better with M2, M3, and M4-series chips in the future. The performance per dollar characteristics of Apple Silicon machines are going to have a huge impact on Broadway’s sound, and I’m very excited to see, or hear, what happens.</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

      Got some hilarious reactions. Gotta share.
    </p><div>

<p>Well, <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support">my last post hit it big</a>. Poor blog had a couple social media death hugs on that day. Gosh, people were fuming about me (supposedly) stating that I would not accept their hand-laced, gold-edged, rose scented bug reports without prior payment. How dare I?! Well, I simply do. </p><figure>

<p>The statement was actually that I ignore support requests from non-customers, <strong>especially</strong> when they come <u>disguised</u> as bugreports in order to avoid my fee. I don’t deliberately delete bug reports from my inbox, I simply risk loosing genuine ones because they are drowned out.</p>

<p>But hey, social media. Fast paced universe. Gotta comment while it’s hot, no time to (properly) read the original article. Some people hold some hilarious opinions, though!</p>

<h2 id="what-people-wrote">What people wrote</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Bugs must be fixed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don’t. Have you read the license agreement? Search for the phrase “AS IS”. Every <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> contains it (usually in caps). It means, I am under no obligation to provide any further work and you are not entitled to it.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a simple way to make me owe you a service (and I’m even offering it): put money in my bank account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bug was your fault in the first place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Oh wait. Is this going to be one of those conspiracy theories where I deliberately put bugs into my code in order to make you pay for removing them? Nice idea, but…</p>

<ul>
<li>That plan does not scale. There are only so many bugs I could plant.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs is the most time consuming form of support. I’m making a loss on that (in particular when considering the time required to design a good bug that some<u>one</u> might pay for getting removed).</li>
<li>I gave you the source, that takes the leverage out of my hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice to use my software was yours. The disclaimer that it might not work is in the license agreement. I did not put myself in the position of being your only option to solve the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My bug reports are a work of art, you prick! I spent MY TIME on helping YOU to improve YOUR software!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your bug doesn’t bother me. If it did, I’d have fixed it myself. When submitting a bug report, you are not working for me, you are working for yourself and the user community. The same way I was, when making the original software available free of charge (whether or not you want to do it is entirely your choice, I’m not asking you to). Does your bug report include a patch? If yes, then the problem’s solved for you, if not, then you are expecting me to come up with a fix. That’s a work order, here’s my bill.</p>

<p>Ignoring bug reports is stupid!</p>

<p>Why? If I look at the mail, I’ll be tempted to act on it, giving someone a free ride. That’s unfair to those who paid for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I’ll have to pay and get no guarantee that my bug will be fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but you are guaranteed, that I will be listening to you and give you a definitive answer in a timely manner. That’s something you don’t get from public bugtrackers. See the problem here? You base your risk assessment on your experience with developers you don’t pay and who therefore have no incentive to help you. When I take your money, you are a customer.</p>

<p>I don’t care.</p>

<ul>
<li>If some other developer wants to self exploit and thinks his time is only worth cheers, that’s their choice.</li>
<li>If the project(s) you are talking about are mission critical (and are otherwise funded), then yes, running a community support forum is a sensible choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the reason, I don’t tend to jump off bridges, just because someone else does it.</p>

<p>You hypocrite! You advertise your software as a solution to MY problem on your website</p>

<p>Part of letting you use my solution is letting you know what problem I solve (by the way, that’s a service, saving you from reading the code in order to figure out what it does - you’re welcome). The conclusion that we both have the same problem was yours to draw. And yes, my software has long since grown beyond my own needs. But guess what, that still doesn’t compel me to work for you for free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You made yourself the sole address for support. At least provide a community support forum!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outsource self-exploitation while eating up the infrastructure cost? Sounds like a plan. <strong>NOT!</strong> Get your ass out of your echo chamber. The idea of community support is one of the big criticisms <strong>against</strong> open source. When people have a problem, they want someone to talk to and they want their problem fixed in a timely manner. They don’t want to sign up for forum accounts and they don’t want to monitor them for weeks in the hopes that some community member might eventually come up with an answer.</p>

<p>When it comes to my software, I’m the most competent person to talk to. So whether I like to or not, people will (try to) contact me. As a developer, that puts a choice on your table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop your spare time being eaten up with tech support by pulling the software.</li>
<li>Start accepting payment and realize that you are now running a business that creates additional overhead cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I made myself the sole address for support. That is the only logical conclusion. If I’m running a business, why should I let it be cannibalized by running a public support forum / bug tracker? That’s just adding infrastructure cost to choke profit.</p>

<p>Math wiz ey? Ever tried applying a scaling factor to a project where the expenses exceed the revenue?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should have a donation button instead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great idea! How often do you click those?</p>

<p>Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.</p>

<p>I’m not running a charity and I don’t want your “support”. I want, same as you, being paid for the work I do. I find it utterly dishonest to put my work under an open source license, then spend a ridiculous amount of extra work on guilt tripping my users in order to collect alms.</p>

<p>If the license says, “the software is free to use”, then that’s the deal. You get exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is extra and billable.</p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what <a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/">Arjun Guha</a> and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><small>Unsharpen may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.</small></p><div>

                                
                                <p>Even a few minutes of research into the best journals and notebooks will yield a recommendation for the Traveler’s Notebook. The universal love of this notebook system makes it clear that this is one of the most unique stationery products sold today as well as being one of the one’s people are simply obsessed with.</p>
<p>So, what’s the deal with the Traveler’s Notebook?</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMxJPZN5hqE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Background">Traveler’s Notebook Background</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is made by the Traveler’s Company. This company is based in the&nbsp;Nakameguro section of Tokyo, Japan but the notebooks are sold all over the place, from an official company store at the Narita Airport (also in Tokyo) to paper stores all over the world. The notebooks and accessories are also sold many places online, including <a href="https://amzn.to/3gVgJAB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, and nearly ever premium stationery retailer.</p>
<p>The notebook might seem like something that has been made for dozens of years — a wonderful throwback to the pre-computer era — but that’s not the case. The standard Traveler’s notebook has been sold since 2006 and the smaller passport size first went on sale in 2010. The company that makes the Traveler’s notebook was original called Midori, but the name was changed to the “Traveler’s Company” in 2015.</p>
<p>The parent company of the Traveler’s Company as well as Midori Paper is Designphil Inc., which has been in existence since 1950 when it was formed under the name Midori Shokai Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>While officially known as the “Traveler’s Notebook” most people refer to the notebook as the “Travelers notebook,” dropping the possessive which seems unnecessary and counter-intuitive.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Basics">Traveler’s Notebook Basics</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is a notebook system, which is to say that there is no canonical “Traveler’s Notebook” but rather endless variations on the company’s notebook system. The basic components are a leather cover, notebook inserts, and then a range of accessories that include rubber bands, pockets, stickers and so forth.</p>
<p>The notebooks are prized for their ability to be refilled, their excellent accessories, and their ability to be incredibly customized so no two Traveler’s notebooks are alike.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Inserts">Traveler’s Notebook Inserts</span></h3>
<p>Each notebook is composed of a leather cover and then inserts. These insert components include:</p>
<ul><li>Covers</li>
<li>Refills</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Accessories</li>
</ul><p>We’ll dig into each type in a bit.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Sizes">Traveler’s Notebook Sizes</span></h3>
<p>The notebooks are sold in two sizes: Regular and Passport. It’s critical to know what cover you have so that you buy the right inserts to fit it. The two sizes are different and are not cross compatible.</p>
<p>The only real difference between the two sizes are their dimensions. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 12.0 x 22.0 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>: 9.8 x 13.4 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
</ul><p>The paper that each notebook uses is different as well. Traveler’s notebook paper has the following dimensions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 11.0 x 21.0 x 0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>:&nbsp;8.9 x 12.4 x&nbsp;0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
</ul><p>The notebooks do not adhere to <a href="https://unsharpen.com/paper-sizes/">standard paper sizes</a>. The closest standard sizes would be B6 for the Regular and B7 for Passport.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Covers">Traveler’s Notebook Covers</span></h2>
<p>The outside of a Traveler’s notebook is a single layer leather cover that is smooth on the outside and suede on the inside. It’s sold in black, brown, dark blue, and a reddish brown, known as “Camel.” The covers are made of a fine leather and they age wonderful, even if you are not particularly careful with them.</p>
<p>The covers lie nearly flat when open and have no branding on them. The main features on the cover are an elastic band that hold it shut and one that holds the inserts in place.</p>
<p>Each leather cover ships in a linen bag that protects it when en route to its own. The cover is prized by buyers but doesn’t have a purpose outside of presentation.</p>
<p>The leather covers are made in Thailand while all the paper is made in Japan.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Refills">Traveler’s Notebook Refills</span></h2>
<p>The refills are the beating heart of the notebook — they are the paper that goes inside. The refills come in Regular and Passport size, just like the covers and use excellent quality Midori paper, which is a major selling point, especially for fountain pen users. The paper does come in a number of varieties.</p>
<p>For the Regular size notebooks these include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong> Lightweight (Tomoe River), Sketch, Craft, Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong> Daily, Weekly, Weekly Vertical, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>For Passport the selection is a bit more limited:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong>&nbsp;Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong>&nbsp;Weekly, Weekly Mid-Year Start, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>While the notebooks are not a standard size, competing companies do make compatible notebooks. Some of the top options for these non-Traveler’s refills are Yamamoto with their Ro-Biki refills and Raymay’a A5 Slim refills.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Storage_Options">Traveler’s Notebook Storage Options</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s notebooks are small but mighty, partly because they have options for holding more than just your ideas.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2OdwuGH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Card File</a> is a bit outdated in the era of the iPhone, but it’s use for storing business cards. There is also a Craft Paper Card File that will store more cards than the standard model, or can be used for assorted scraps of paper, stickers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Double-sided stickers are sold to insert photographs, cut out articles, and other mementos. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3iR9knv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Film Pocket Sticker</a> is quite similar, but it’s actually a light plastic sticker that adheres to your notebook or inside a refill and then you can place a photo or piece of paper inside without damaging it. Traveler’s Pocket Stickers are similar but are angled at the top and fully open, so they can used for storing taller items. The Large Pocket Sticker can hole a full photograph or index card on its side.</p>
<p>The most robust storage options are the <a href="https://amzn.to/2W8Dau7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zipper Case</a> and Three-fold File, which can handle larger items and much more of then. The Three-fold File for the standard notebook can even hold a full-sized piece of A4 paper that has been triple-folded (like a you would do to a letter). The Zipper Case can hold ink cartridges, a small pencil sharpener, paper clips, refills or other similar items that won’t fit in a pocket.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Accessories">Traveler’s Notebook Accessories</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s Company loves their accessories… and so do Traveler’s notebook enthusiasts. Some of the accessories include:</p>
<ul><li>Pen holder</li>
<li>Additional elastic bands (known as Connecting Bands)</li>
<li>Plastic Sheet Underlay</li>
<li>Repair Kit (replacement elastic bands)</li>
<li>Refill Binder (for storing refills that are full and no longer needed in your notebook)</li>
<li>Brass charm (for accessorizing the notebook)</li>
<li>Traveler’s Company stickers</li>
</ul><h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Alternatives">Traveler’s Notebook Alternatives</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook might be a distinct thing made by a specific brand, but many other brands have recognized its success and sell similar products. After all, it’s not like the Traveler’s Company was the first to invent a leather notebook cover or to put excellent paper and handy pockets inside of a notebook, journal, folder, or folio!</p>
<p>The main choice with an alternative will be if you want a leather-covered notebook or just a customizable notebook system. Both of these are reasonable ways to define the Traveler’s system, so shop according to your desires for a leather cover, a modular notebook system, or both.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite options for alternatives are:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2ATOyma" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kokuyo Jibun Techo 2020 3 in 1 Set</a></strong></li>
<li>Kokuyo Systemic cover and notebooks</li>
<li>Chic Sparrow Notebook system</li>
<li>Field Notes Everyday Inspiration Leather Cover and memo pads</li>
<li>Bellroy leather notebook cover and notebook inserts</li>
</ul><h2><span id="FAQs">FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Is_there_an_A5_sized_Travelers_Notebook">Is there an A5 sized Traveler’s Notebook?</span></h3>
<p>No, an official Traveler’s notebook in A5 does not exist. Chic Sparrow does sell a similar refillable, leather-covered notebook in A5 as do other, <a href="https://amzn.to/325etCx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lesser known brands</a>, but Traveler’s does not.</p>
<h3><span id="How_do_I_care_for_a_Travelers_Notebook_leather_cover">How do I care for a Traveler’s Notebook leather cover?</span></h3>
<p>The leather cover on a Traveler’s notebook is made to wear in and weather over time. It uses a natural dye that is beautiful but not as tough as some other leather products. The leather should never be washed or cleaned except in the case of a spill where it can be blotted with a damp cloth.</p>
<h3><span id="What_do_I_do_if_the_Travelers_notebook_cover_gets_wet">What do I do if the Traveler’s notebook cover gets wet?</span></h3>
<p>If the leather cover gets wet, you should pat it dry, not rub it, so as to not pull out any of the natural dye. Unnecessary rubbing or friction can pull dye from the leather when it’s wet, so this should be minimized. When as much of the moisture is removed as possible the notebook should be emptied and left to dry in the shade, not out in the sun.</p>
<h3><span id="What_to_do_if_notebooks_cover_has_a_stain_or_blemish">What to do if notebook’s cover has a stain or blemish?</span></h3>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook’s cover was lightly treated exactly so that the cover could wear in. Try to ignore the blemish and continue to use the notebook. Over time it will wear and developer a patina and personality and the blemish will be unnoticeable (or at least well hidden). Unsightly stains and oil spots can be treated carefully with any leather cleaner or leather care cream, though try a small patch first to make sure the natural dye is not affected.</p>

<p>I’m talking to you, Mr. or Mrs. Person who keeps saying “I should really start a blog.” Or maybe it’s more like “I should really post to my poor, lonely blog.”</p>



<p>Yes, you should. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/02/write-5x-more-but-write-5x-less/">I already wrote my manifesto on why</a>, so I won’t repeat it here. But you should. So either <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">do it or stop talking about it</a>.</p>



<p>Stop waiting for motivation, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/18/discipline-eats-motivation-for-breakfast/">use some discipline</a>. Make writing a part of your daily routine.</p>



<p>For me, when I sit down at my desk in the morning I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/18/100-daily-blog-posts/">write a quick blog post</a>. It’s how I ramp up for the day. Maybe that works for you too, and maybe not. But either way, work it into your routine somewhere or it won’t become a habit.</p>



<p>Do it, right now. Schedule it on <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">your calendar</a>. Make a plan. Tell yourself it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">just an experiment</a>, so it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">not scary</a> or permanent.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll be glad you did. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/28/2-months-of-daily-blogging/">I know I am</a>!</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used audio software on the computer, you probably know that MIDI exists: a signalling protocol that allows controllers to control virtual instruments like synths. It’s also the protocol used by real audio hardware to talk to each, and you can think of it as the language in which, rathar than communicating a fluctuating voltage signal or series of discrete sample values, devices talk about what is being done on them (“A4 got pressed”, “F4 got released”,  “the mod wheel moved down”, etc).</p>

<p>As such, there are two ways to record digital instruments (real or virtual): you can record the sound they’re making, or you can record the MIDI events that cause them to make those sounds, and that’s where things get interesting.</p>

<p>There are many, <em>many</em> ways to record audio, from microphones to line monitors to audio interfaces, on dedicated hardware, computers, phones, etc. etc., but there aren’t all that many ways to record MIDI events. Essentially: unless you’re running software that monitors MIDI events, there just isn’t really any way to record MIDI. So I set out to change that: in the same way that you can just hook up an audio field recorder (like a Tascam DR-05) to sit between an audio-out on something that generates audio and an audio-in on something that should be listening to that audio, writing that to an SD card as <code>.wav</code> or <code>.mp3</code> or the like,  I built a MIDI “field recorder” that you plug in between your MIDI-out and some MIDI-in, indiscriminately recording every MIDI event that gets sent over the wire to an SD card as a <code>.mid</code> file.</p>

<p>You’d think this would be something that already exists as a product you can just buy (even if at probably quite the markup because it’s made of “powder-coated extruded aluminium” with “audiophile quality” components, but still). Amazingly, it is not. There’s just nothing.</p>

<p>So: if you want a MIDI recorder, you’ll have to build one… and if you want to build one, this post might be useful to you!</p>

<h2 id="the-circuitry">The circuitry</h2>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/banner.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/banner.jpg" width="100%"></a></p>

<p>To build this, we’re going to basically build a standard “MIDI-In + MIDI-Thru” circuit using an Arduino, with an SD card module hooked up so we can save the data that comes flying by. To build everything, we’ll need some special components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Arduino SD card module (~$10 for a pack of five)</li>
  <li>Two female 5-pin DIN connectors (~$5 for a pack of ten)</li>
  <li>A 6N138 optocoupler (~$10 for a pack of ten)</li>
</ol>

<p>And of course, the bits that you’ll get with pretty much any Arduino starter kit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Arduino UNO R3 or equivalent board</li>
  <li>4x 220 ohm resistors</li>
  <li>1x 4.7k ohm resistor</li>
  <li>A diode</li>
  <li>A piezo buzzer</li>
  <li>Two clicky pushy buttons</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-midi-part-of-our-recorder">The MIDI part of our recorder</h3>

<p>We set up MIDI-In on the Arduino <code>RX&lt;-0</code> pin, with MIDI-Thru tapping straight into signal that’s getting sent to <code>RX&lt;-0</code>, too. The only tricky bit about this is that MIDI signals are isolated from the rest of the circuitry via an optocoupler (which gets around ground loop problems by literally transmitting signals by running them through a LED, which emits the electrical signal as light, which then gets picked up by a phototransistor that turns the light back into an electrical signal). When placing and connecting the optocoupler, it is very important to make sure you know which pin is pin 1: it’ll have a little mark next to it (typically a dot on the chip casing) to tell you that that side has pins 1 through 4 running top to bottom, and pins 5 through 8 on the other side <em>running bottom to top</em>. Also note that we’re not using pins 1 and 4 for this circuit: only pins 2 and 3 are connected to the MIDI-In connector, and pins 5 through 8 are connected to the various arduino pins.</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/MIDI.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="MIDI circuit diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/MIDI.png" width="75%"></a></p>

<p>(I know, “Thru isn’t a word!”, but that’s what <a href="http://www.shclemen.com/download/The%20Complete%20MIDI1.0%20Detailed%20Spec.pdf#page=7&amp;zoom=auto,-206,478">the MIDI spec</a> calls it, so English gets to take a back seat here…)</p>

<h3 id="the-sd-part-of-our-recorder">The SD part of our recorder</h3>

<p>The SD card circuitry is literally just a matter of “connect the pins to the pins”, with the only oddity being that the pins don’t <em>quite</em> line up well enough to literally just stick the SD card module directly into the Arduino.</p>

<p>However, note that your SD card module <strong>may have a different pin layout</strong> so be sure to double-check before wiring things up!</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/sd%20card.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="SD module diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/sd%20card.png" width="50%"></a></p>

<h3 id="adding-a-midi-marker-button">Adding a MIDI marker button</h3>

<p>In order to make it easier to find particularly “worth revisiting” parts of what got recorded, we add a button that connects to pin 4, that we can use to write MIDI markers into our file. There is barely anything to this circuit:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/button.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="simple button diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/button.png" width="50%"></a></p>

<h3 id="adding-a-beep-for-debugging">Adding a beep, for debugging</h3>

<p>And finally, we’re going to add a little piezo speaker and a button that we can press to turn on (or off) playing a note corresponding to a MIDI note getting played, mostly as the audio equivalent of visual debugging. There’s barely any work here: we hook up the “speaker” between pin 8 and ground, and the button to pin 2. Beep, beep!</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/beep.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="beep beep button diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/beep.png" width="50%"></a></p>

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>With the circuitry set up, let’s start writing our program, focussing on dealing with each circuit in its own section</p>

  <li><a href="#a-final-helper-script">Usability bonus 2: “fix the track length” script</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="program-basics">Program basics</h3>

<p>Our basic program will need to import the standard <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SD">SD</a> library, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library">MIDI</a> library (which you’ll probably need to <a href="https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library#getting-started">install first</a>).</p>

<p>Note that if you don’t want to “follow along” and instead you just want the code, you can copy-paste the code found over in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/midi-recorder.ino">midi-recorder.ino</a> into the Arduino IDE.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;SD.h&gt;
#include &lt;MIDI.h&gt;
</span>
<span>MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE</span><span>();</span>

<span>void</span> <span>setup</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// we'll put some more code here in the next sections</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>loop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// we'll put some more code here in the next sections</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we’re done!</p>

<p>Of course this doesn’t <em>do</em> anything yet, so let’s add the rest of the code, too.</p>

<h3 id="midi-handling">MIDI handling</h3>

<p>For our MIDI handling, we’ll need to set up listeners for MIDI events, and make sure to poll for that data during the program loop:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>setup</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span><span>MIDI_CHANNEL_OMNI</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>handleNoteOn</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>handleNoteOff</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandlePitchBend</span><span>(</span><span>handlePitchBend</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleControlChange</span><span>(</span><span>handleControlChange</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>loop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This sets up MIDI listening on all MIDI channels (there are sixteen of them, and we don’t want to guess which channels are active), and reads out the MIDI data from <code>RX&lt;-0</code> - you may have noticed we don’t explicitly set a baud rate: the MIDI spec only allows for 31,250 bits per second, so the Arduino MIDI library automatically makes sure to set the correct polling rate for us.</p>

<p>That leaves implementing our MIDI event handling:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define NOTE_OFF_EVENT 0x81
#define NOTE_ON_EVENT 0x91
#define CONTROL_CHANGE_EVENT 0xB1
#define PITCH_BEND_EVENT 0xE1
</span>
<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>NOTE_OFF_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>velocity</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>NOTE_ON_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>velocity</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleControlChange</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>controller</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>CONTROL_CHANGE_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>controller</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handlePitchBend</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>bend_value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// First off, we need to "recenter" the bend value,</span>
  <span>// because in MIDI, the bend value is a positive value</span>
  <span>// in the range 0x0000-0x3FFF with 0x2000 considered</span>
  <span>// the "neutral" mid point:</span>
  <span>bend_value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0x2000</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Then, per the MIDI spec, bend_value is 14 bits, and</span>
  <span>// needs to be encoded as two 7-bit bytes, encoded as</span>
  <span>// the lowest 7 bits in the first byte, and the highest</span>
  <span>// 7 bits in the second byte:</span>
  <span>byte</span> <span>lowBits</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>bend_value</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x7F</span><span>);</span>
  <span>byte</span> <span>highBits</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>((</span><span>bend_value</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>7</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x7F</span><span>);</span>

  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>PITCH_BEND_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>lowBits</span><span>,</span> <span>highBits</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(note that we’re ignoring the <code>channel</code> byte: we’ll be creating a “simple” format 0 MIDI file, and for maximum usability in terms of importing our data in a DAW, we’re putting all the events on channel 2)</p>

<p>This is a good start, but MIDI events are just that: events, and events happen “at some specific time” which we’re still going to have to capture. MIDI events don’t rely on absolute time based on some kind of real time clock (which is good for us, because Arduino doesn’t have an RTC built in!) and instead relies on counting a “time delta”: it marks events with the number of “MIDI clock ticks” since the previous event, with the very first event in the event stream having an explicit time delta of zero.</p>

<p>So: let’s write a <code>getDelta()</code> function that we can use to get the number of MIDI ticks since the last event (=since the last time <code>getDelta()</code> got called) so that we have all the data we need ready to start writing MIDI to file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>startTime</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>millis</span><span>();</span>
    <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>startTime</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>millis</span><span>();</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>now</span> <span>-</span> <span>lastTime</span><span>);</span>
  <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>now</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>delta</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function seems bigger than it has to be: we <em>could</em> just start the clock when our sketch starts, setting <code>lastTime=millis()</code> in <code>setup()</code>, and then in <code>getDelta</code> only have the <code>timeDelta</code> calculation and <code>lastTime</code> update, but that would be explicitly encoding “a lot of nothing” at the start of our MIDI file: we’d be counting the ticks for the first event relative to starting the program, rather than treating the first event as starting at tick zero. So instead, we explicitly encode the time that the first event happens as <code>startTime</code> and then we start delta calculation relative to that, instead.</p>

<p>That then leaves updating our handlers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

				<p><a href="http://www.eternityroad.info/index.php/weblog/screeds/14/">Robert Conquest’s Three Laws of Politics</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.  </li>
<li>Any organization not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.  </li>
<li>The simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies. </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/03_06_22_corner-archive.asp#010158">John Derbyshire</a> adds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the Second Law, Conquest gave the Church of England and Amnesty International as examples. Of the Third, he noted that a bureaucracy sometimes actually <em>is</em> controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies — e.g. the postwar British secret service. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.tinyvital.com/BlogArchives/000322.html">John Moore</a> thinks the third law is <em>almost</em> right; it should read “assume that it is controlled by a cabal of <em>the enemies of the stated purpose of that bureaucracy</em>.”</p>
<p>Francis W. Porretto notes that Cyril Northcote Parkinson studied the same phenomenon of bureaucratic behavior:</p>
<blockquote><p>Parkinson promulgated a number of laws of bureaucracy that serve to explain a huge percentage of its characteristics. They’ve exhibited remarkable predictive power within their domain. The first of these is the best known:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Parkinson’s First Law</strong>: Work expands to fill the time available for its completion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parkinson inferred this effect from two central principles governing the behavior of bureaucrats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Officials want to multiply subordinates, not rivals. </li>
<li>Officials make work for one another. </li>
</ol>
<p>Like most generalizations, these are not always true…but the incentives that apply specifically to tax-funded government bureaucracies make them true much more often than not. They make a striking contrast with the almost exactly opposite behavior observable in private enterprise.<br>[...]<br>That young bureaucrat will profit from deliberate ineffectiveness to the extent that he can get himself viewed as an asset by his superiors and a non-threat by his peers. His superiors want him to produce justifications for the enlargement of their domains. His peers simply ask that he not tread on their provinces. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miltion Friedman noted that bureaucratic resource allocation involves spending other people’s money on other people, so there are no compelling reasons to control either cost or quality — but a bureaucrat will learn, given time, how to “spend on others” in such a fashion that the primary benefit flows to himself.</p>
<p>To do this, bureaucrats must manage perceptions, so that their work seems both necessary and successful:</p>
<blockquote><p>Von Clausewitz and others have termed war “a continuation of politics by other means,” but when viewed from the perspective of the State Department official, war is the declaration that his organization has failed of its purpose. He sees it as bad public relations for his entire function. Thus, even when the nation’s interests would be overwhelmingly better served by war than by the continuation of diplomacy, the State Department man will prefer diplomacy. It’s in his demesne, and enhances his prestige by enhancing the prestige of his trade.</p>
<p>It’s not too much to say that averting war regardless of its desirability or justifiability is near the top of every State Department functionary’s list of priorities. In this pursuit, the State Department will often find itself opposing even peacetime operations of the military designed to improve its effectiveness, such as the acquisition of new weapons or the enlargement of its ranks. </p>
</blockquote>

              <section>
              <p>Anonymous posts on Gurlic are quite straight-forward. There is an actual user with the username <code>anonymous</code>. Whenever a new anonymous post is created, the database query looks like this:</p><pre><code>INSERT into posts(content, user_id) 
VALUES($1, (SELECT id from users where username='anonymous'))</code></pre><p>Initially, I wanted a way for users to be able to edit their anonymous posts. That is a little tricky though, because there has to be some record that ties the user to the post itself - which defeats the purpose of anonymous posts. In the case of a database leak, that connection is out in the public. We don't want that.</p><p>So anonymous posts are pretty much a one-off action because once they're created, the user no longer has any control over them - whether it's editing the post, marking it as NSFW, deleting it and so on. </p><p>This also means that the <code>anonymous</code> user has a <a href="https://gurlic.com/anonymous" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">profile</a>, just like any other user, and can be followed, mentioned etc.</p><p>I'm sure someone has a much better way to implement anonymous posts that are tied to the users that created them, while being secure at the same time. It does seem like a lot of extra work though. </p><p>Why be not lazy when you can be lazy?</p>

          the late 1980s I was making paintings about computer games. In January 1991 I bought an Amiga computer and made a series of fictional 
          videogame stills using Deluxe Paint II. I photographed them straight 
          from the screen as there was no other way to output them that I knew 
          of apart from through a very primitive daisy wheel printer where they appeared as washed out dots. <p>
          
          The effect of the photographs perfectly reproduced the highly 
          pixellated, raised needlepoint effect of the Amiga screen image. Conceptually 
          this means of presentation was also appropriate in that it made it seem 
          like I had gone into a videogame arcade and photographed the games there, 
          lending authenticity to the fiction.</p></span><span color="#99cc33" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The first seven works on this page form a series titled, 'Q.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I’ll respond as someone who is very familiar with both htmx and Intercooler (the predecessor of htmx).</p>
<p>I would say htmx happens to very nicely support progressive enhancement, if that’s your goal. Take this description of the hx:boost attribute for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>hx-boost</code> attribute allows you to “boost” normal anchors and form tags to use AJAX instead. This has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nice fallback</a> that, if the user does not have javascript enabled, the site will continue to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But what really sets htmx apart</strong></em> imho, is that you get to update <em>parts</em> of the page dynamically, by just adding some html attributes! I.e. no JavaScript required.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end there of course, it makes implementing many web app staples like lazy loading, type-ahead search, dependent selects, click-to-edit, etc. absolutely trivial to implement (here’s the list of examples: <a href="https://htmx.org/examples" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://htmx.org/examples</a>).</p>
<p>Then there’s event handling, animation transitions, websockets, sse … the list goes on … ALL through specifying some attributes on bog standard html elements!</p>
<p>The clue is in the name really: htm<strong>x</strong>… as in <em>extending</em> html. I like to think of it as extending the html spec to bring you everything we’ve come to expect from modern web app development, purely through html, css and your favorite back-end framework.</p>
<p>My personal intercooler/htmx journey began by wanting to “ajaxify” a rather large, traditional MVC, full-page-refresh app, without doing a complete rewrite (it’s a Playframework app, so essentially the Java-based equivalent of Rails).</p>
<p>It was trivially easy to start “sprinkling in” aka progressively enhancing the app, with no backend changes at all, just by adding a few attributes on the existing html elements.</p>
<p>Not long after that, we had transformed the entire app into what feels like any other SPA (not a single full page refresh in sight), complete with history (back-button) support, while it still being a bog standard MVC app, with server side templates being rendered to the frontend. This, as they say, was a MASSIVE win <img src="https://sjc2.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/images/emoji/apple/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" alt=":grin:"></p>
<p>Bottom line: if you believe that simplicity beats the “sexy" complexity introduced by heavy JS frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, etc; if you’re a single developer/small team wanting to productively churn out simple, easy to understand code that doesn’t require a bunch of extra build steps; if you buy into philosophies like the idea behind Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js and yes some parts of Hotwire (<em>especially</em> the “html over the wire” part), then I suggest you at least try out htmx before you make a decision.</p>
<p>I’m willing to bet you won’t regret it <img src="https://sjc2.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>P.S. I Just saw that the guy who made both intercooler and htmx responded while I was writing this, by pretty much saying what I was trying to say, just much more succinctly <img src="https://sjc2.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/images/emoji/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" alt=":joy:"></p>

We’ve <a href="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/lower-language-constructs-to-llvm/">desugared our language to get it ready for LLVM</a> - the main takeaway is that objects have been desugared to structs, and their methods desugared to functions.</p><p>Learn about LLVM and you’ll be the envy of your friends.

If you’ve come across instruction sets before, LLVM IR is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer#:~:text=A%20reduced%20instruction%20set%20computer,instruction%20set%20computer%20(CISC).">RISC</a> instruction set.</p><p>The upshot of it is that LLVM IR looks like a more <em>readable</em> form of assembly. As LLVM IR is <strong>machine independent</strong>, we don’t need to worry about the number of registers, size of datatypes, calling conventions or other machine-specific details.</p><p>So instead of a fixed number of physical registers, in LLVM IR we have an unlimited set of <em>virtual</em> registers (labelled <code>%0</code>, <code>%1</code>, <code>%2</code>, <code>%3</code>… we can write and read from. It’s the backend’s job to map from virtual to physical registers.</p><p>And rather than allocating specific sizes of datatypes, we retain <strong>types</strong> in LLVM IR. Again, the backend will take this type information and map it to the size of the datatype. LLVM has types for different sizes of <code>int</code>s and floats, e.g. <code>int32</code>, <code>int8</code>, <code>int1</code> etc. It also has derived types: like <strong>pointer</strong> types, <strong>array</strong> types, <strong>struct</strong> types, <strong>function</strong> types. To find out more, check out the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Type.html">Type</a> documentation.</p><p>Now, built into LLVM are a set of optimisations we can run over the LLVM IR e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination">dead-code elimination</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function inlining</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rco/vignettes/opt-common-subexpr.html">common subexpression elimination</a> etc. The details of these algorithms are irrelevant: LLVM implements them for us.</p><p>Our side of the bargain is that we write LLVM IR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static Single Assignment (SSA) form</a>, as SSA form makes life easier for optimisation writers. SSA form sounds fancy, but it just means we define variables before use and assign to variables <strong>only once</strong>. In SSA form, we cannot reassign to a variable, e.g. <code>x = x+1</code>; instead we assign to a fresh variable each time (<code>x2 = x1 + 1</code>).</p><p>So in short: LLVM IR looks like assembly with <strong>types</strong>, minus the messy machine-specific details. LLVM IR must be in SSA form, which makes it easier to optimise.

<h2>Roughly 500 employees failed the test, which claimed they would receive a $650 bonus.</h2>



<p>“2020 has been a record year for GoDaddy, thanks to you!” the email read.</p>



<p>Sent by Happyholiday@Godaddy.com, tucked underneath a glittering banner of a snowflake and stamped with the words “GoDaddy Holiday Party,” the Dec. 14 email to hundreds of GoDaddy employees promised some welcome financial relief during an <a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/tens-of-millions-of-americans-face-economic-ruin-unless-congress-gets-its-sht-together/">otherwise stressful year</a>.</p>



<p>“Though we cannot celebrate together during our annual Holiday Party, we want to show our appreciation and share a $650 one-time Holiday bonus!” the email read. “To ensure that you receive your one-time bonus in time for the Holidays, please select your location and fill in the details by Friday, December 18th.”</p>



<p>But, two days later, the company sent another email.</p>



<p>“You’re getting this email because you failed our recent phishing test,” the company’s chief security officer Demetrius Comes<strong> </strong>wrote. “You will need to retake the Security Awareness Social Engineering training.”</p>

	</figure>



<p>Phishing tests are sent by companies to gauge their employees’ susceptibility to phishing attacks, where people outside the company will attempt to disguise themselves as trusted sources to gain access to sensitive information, like usernames and passwords.</p>



<p>The follow-up email from Comes said that roughly 500 GoDaddy employees clicked on the holiday bonus email and “failed the test.”</p>



<p>Scottsdale-based GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar and web-hosting company, did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the emails. The emails were forwarded to The Copper Courier by three GoDaddy employees.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/05/05/godaddy-confirms-data-breach-what-19-million-customers-need-to-know/?sh=235bf0a91daa">Forbes reported</a> that 28,000 GoDaddy customers were impacted after a data breach compromised their account usernames and passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the company <a href="https://investors.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Reports-Second-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx">surpassing 20 million customers this year</a> and reporting “record customer growth,” the company <a href="https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Blog-Update/default.aspx">laid off or reassigned</a> hundreds of employees during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/business/godaddy-to-lay-off-hundreds-close-texas-offices">including in Arizona</a>, Iowa, and Texas.</p>



<p>GoDaddy is not the first company this year to trick employees into falling for phishing scams by dangling the carrot of a potential bonus.</p>



<p>In September, Tribune Publishing, which owns <a href="https://www.tribpub.com/#">several major newspapers</a> around the country, sent a similar email to its employees.</p>



<p>The email, circulated by <a href="https://twitter.com/justin_fenton/status/1308851669397053440">several furious Tribune employees on Twitter</a>, said the company was giving out targeted bonuses of $5,000-$10,000, only to later reveal itself as a phishing test sent by the company.</p>



<figure><div>
<figure><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've been able to confirm that this was in fact! an internal test from <a href="https://twitter.com/tribpub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tribpub</a>. If you click the links, you get a message from the company's training contractor saying you clicked on a simulated phishing test.</p><p>The level of cruelty is actually stunning, even for this company.</p></div>— Danielle Ohl (@DTOhl) <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote></figure>
</div></figure>



<p>“The level of cruelty is actually stunning,” Tribune reporter Danielle Ohl <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308850196978298880%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fy3z8g5%2Ftribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">wrote at the time</a>.</p>



<p>A Tribune spokesperson <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3z8g5/tribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">later told Vice News</a> that the exercise was part of a regular, internal test to assess phishing risks and said that it had no intention of offending its employees. “In retrospect, the topic of the email was misleading and insensitive, and the company apologizes for its use,” the statement read.</p>

<p>Excerpted from <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/">Functional Programming and the Semantics of Change, State &amp; Time</a> because sometimes you need to see the waterfall to want to take the hike.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were all object-oriented programmers at one point in time — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/ValueOfValuesLong.md">The Value of Values</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assimilation of functional semantics with any regular conception of the physical world is no easy task. Look again around the room, bus or park and you will likely still identify distinct objects that may change over time. I kicked around chapter 3 of <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> for over a year before wrapping my head around it. That we may still be experiencing disbelief at the thought of a new model for time suggests a larger game at play.</p>
<p>Dominant scientific paradigms pervade our language, on the one hand, and way of thinking, on the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientific practice always involves the production and the explanation of generalizations about nature; those activities presuppose a language with some minimal richness; and the acquisition of such a language brings knowledge of nature with it. When the exhibit of examples is part of the process of learning terms like “motion,” ‘‘cell,‘‘ or ‘‘energy element,’’ what is acquired is knowledge of language and of the world together. <strong>On the one hand</strong>, the student learns what these terms mean, what features are relevant to attaching them to nature, what things cannot be said of them on pain of self-contradiction, and so on. <strong>On the other hand</strong>, the student learns what categories of things populate the world, what their salient features are, and something about the behavior that is and is not permitted to them. In much of language learning these two sorts of knowledge — <strong>knowledge of words and knowledge of nature</strong> — are acquired together, not really two sorts of knowledge at all, but two faces of the single coinage that a language provides. — Thomas Kuhn, <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">What are Scientific Revolutions?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, a new discovery “that cannot be accommodated within the concepts in use before” may elicit surprise or even disbelief. “One cannot get from the old to the new simply by an addition to what was already known. Nor can one quite describe the new in the vocabulary of the old or vice versa.” (<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">Thomas Kuhn</a>) Rather, in order to “make or to assimilate such a discovery one must alter the way one thinks about and describes some range of natural phenomena”; even the articulation of an observation that runs counter to the dominant paradigm can only be “formulated by altering the language with which nature [is] described.” (<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">Thomas Kuhn</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the compound sentence, “In the Ptolemaic system planets revolve about the earth; in the Copernican they revolve about the sun.” Strictly construed, that sentence is incoherent. The first occurrence of the term “planet” is Ptolemaic, the second Copernican, and the two attach to nature differently. For no univocal reading of the term “planet” is the compound sentence true. — Thomas Kuhn, <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">What are Scientific Revolutions?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, object-orientation pervades our language, on the one hand. That “objects change as time elapses” is a statement of obvious fact betrays the object-oriented presumption embedded in our language. “Object” (and “identity”), “change” (and “state”), and “time” work together to describe a coherent <em>object-oriented</em> view. On the other hand, objects orient our perception of our own physical reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modeling with objects is powerful and intuitive, largely because this matches the perception of interacting with a world of which we are part. — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look again around the room, bus, park or wherever you find yourself reading this sentence, and you will likely identify “a collection of distinct objects,” such as dogs, people, and trees, “whose behaviors may change over time.”</p>
<p>Yet, the behavior of a functional program cannot be described in terms that attribute change to the enduring identity of objects as time elapses. And because of the dominance of object-orientation as reflected in the presumptions of our natural language, we cannot so much as describe the semantics of a functional program except through altering our language and reconstituting our physical reality. Meaningful “identity” must disappear in favor of change itself. “State” must describe the result of change instead of an object quality. “Time” must describe discrete state changes rather than any continuous dynamicness attributable to all objects.</p>
<p>No wonder the functional model may still elicit disbelief. <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time">This essay</a> can be seen as an uphill climb against the gravity of a dominant paradigm; the functional view is perhaps expressible now, but only because of <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time">the arduous work put in above</a>. Our natural language is not so easily distorted, violated and repurposed and our thought patterns are comorbid with our language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until those changes had occurred, language itself resisted the invention and introduction of the sought after new theories. The same resistance by language is, I take it, the reason for Planck’s switch from ‘‘element’’ and ‘‘resonator’’ to ‘‘quantum’’ and ‘‘oscillator.’’ Violation or distortion of a previously unproblematic scientific language is the touchstone for revolutionary change. — Thomas Kuhn, <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">What are Scientific Revolutions?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, teaching functional programming to anyone is like teaching Copernican astronomy to a Ptolemaic astronomer or quantum mechanics to a Newtonian physicist. We lack the basic language to articulate the underlying concepts. Worse still, the language we do have is endemic to a conflicting paradigm. Perhaps the disparity between the efficacy<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> and popularity<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> of functional programming languages is best explained in this light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it — Max Plank, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed027p288.1">autobiography</a>, quoted by Thomas Kuhn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, the functional view is indeed expressible as a result of the <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time">work put in above</a>. We can see change as creating something new, instead of altering something of old, and time as a series of successive states. We can alter our language and reimagine our physical reality to support a functional view of change, state and time.</p>
<hr>
<section>
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>There are many advantages to functional programming. Programs that deal with mutation are “drastically more difficult” to reason about than ones that do not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Referential transparency is violated when we include set! [i.e. assignment operations] in our computer language. This makes it tricky to determine when we can simplify expressions by substituting equivalent expressions. Consequently, reasoning about programs that use assignment becomes drastically more difficult — SICP Section 3.1.3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, functions avoid <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html">temporal coupling</a> since there is no time,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, programming with assignment forces us to carefully consider the relative orders of the assignments to make sure that each statement is using the correct version of the variables that have been changed. This issue simply does not arise in functional programs. — SICP Section 3.1.3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and dramatically reduce debugging and unit testing complexity since there is no meaningful context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And that is the problem with places. You have this sort of global state that you have to reproduce in order to debug a field problem. That is very very tough.” Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/ValueOfValuesLong.md">The Value of Values</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reified state couches in writing what must otherwise live in a programmer’s heads — each member of a team can read a function signature instead of building up (hopefully) the same working memory for each object. Couching state in language makes it accessible to static language analysis tools. <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/07/01/yes-silver-bullet/#bd2d47d8dac2401e936ca7902bc9109d">A compiler may exhaustively permute the set of application states</a> without actually running manually-written (exhaust<em>ing</em>) unit tests. Functional programs are more easily parallelized since they are just functions with no internal model for time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the complexities introduced by assignment become even more problematic in the presence of concurrency. — SICP Section 3.4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These advantages have been known for decades. John Backus “gave high visibility to functional programming” (SICP Section 3.5.5; also see Simon Peyton-Jones, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re96UgMk6GQ">Escape from the ivory tower: the Haskel journey</a>) through his <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Turing Award lecture</a> in 1978, seven years before the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> and thirteen before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        

<p><img src="https://makeartwithpython.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mcyds.png" alt="McDonalds!"></p>

<p>There is no shortage of questionable products to connect you and your home to the internet.</p>

<p>Each brings another sketchy WiFi device connected to your network, and another set of microphones, each listening in your home for their special trigger word.</p>

<p>Rather than invite more digital strangers into our home, it feels more appropriate to keep a personal garden of digital things we’ve made.</p>

<p>In today’s post, we’ll build a tiny web application (and iPhone / Android app!) to control Christmas lights that only works when you’re home, and connected to your home network.</p>



<p><img src="https://kpkaiser.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/react-native-christmas1.png" alt="React Native Christmas Lights"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3hezYGq">Jetson Nano</a> is my favorite platforms for building localized internet of things projects.</p>

<p>It’s an ARM64 device, with four built in USB ports, and was designed to do machine learning at the edge.</p>

<p>We’ll use it as a server for a <a href="https://amzn.to/3pmSe3c">Z-Wave USB Stick</a>. Z-Wave is a protocol that exists to do home automation. Importantly for us, it operates separately from your WiFi.</p>

<p>In my case, I’ve hooked it up to 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/3hgyxHt">outdoor light switches</a>, to turn on and off my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>The light switches come in a waterproof shielding, with a single manual button on them. You can press the button to enable pair mode, and also to manually turn the lights on and off.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the React Native app running on my iPhone.</p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn’t attempt to build an iPhone app for such a small project.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> has made running code on your phone a great experience. They automatically build and push to your phone via an app and the command line.</p>

<h2 id="building-an-api-for-your-christmas-lights">Building an API for Your Christmas Lights</h2>

<p>The first thing we’ll want to do is check to make sure we’ve got the Z-Wave stick installed and running on our USB drive in the Jetson Nano.</p>

<p>Every time I work with Z-Wave, I forget details of how the Z-Wave network model works. Because of this, I like to open up an IPython session, and start playing around with the network:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>openzwave</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.option</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.network</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span>

<span># make sure these Z-wave commands get flushed with a time.sleep</span>
<span># also, /dev/ttyACM0 is the name of my USB port for the Z-Stick</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span><span>(</span><span>'/dev/ttyACM0'</span><span>)</span>
<span>options</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>()</span>

<span>network</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span># the next two lines start an IPython session in line</span>
<span>import</span> <span>IPython</span>
<span>IPython</span><span>.</span><span>embed</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From here, I start to remember how things work, and see that <code>list(network.nodes.keys())</code> gives me a list of the <code>nodes</code> connected to the Z-Wave network. Because I’m in IPython, I can also tab through each object to see the functions available.</p>

<p>But how do you know what capabilities each Z-Wave node has?</p>

<p>Some Z-Wave devices have multiple switches built into them, each potentially with their own dimmer. To grab switches, we need to do a <code>list(network.nodes[node].get_switches.keys())</code>.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we can then set state on each node with a <code>set_switch</code> function call:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
<span>for</span> <span>node</span> <span>in</span> <span>node_list</span><span>:</span>
    <span>switches</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switches</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>change</span><span>[</span><span>'state'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>True</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>False</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that I know how to effect change, I can build an API in Flask to serve up changes:</p>

<p>I’ve added a <code>time.sleep</code>, because it can take a bit for the Z-Wave network to propagate state. Two seconds is probably too long to sleep for, but hey, it works, and I’m not in a hurry.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-react-native-app-with-expo">Building a React Native App with Expo</h2>

<p>Again, building an app is usually too much work for such a small project. But it had been a while since I’d built an app, and I kept hearing about React Native, so I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>I was surprised to be able to have a built version of my app on my phone in under an hour. There’s a new platform called Expo, which handles all of the heavy lifting usually associated with deploying an iPhone app.</p>

<p>Indeed, because my “app” was so small (literally a single button and a single state of <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>), I really didn’t have much to do beyond the basic, example app:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>React</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>useState</span><span>,</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<p>Here, you can see the call to my Flask app’s API, on my local area network. I’ve set a static IP address for my Jetson Nano, and am running a Flask server on a non-standard port, <code>8050</code>. I did this because I have other Flask apps running on my Nano.</p>

<p>When the app is opened, a <code>GET</code> request is made to the <code>/state</code> resource. It returns a JSON object, with the current state of the Z-Wave switches. If one is on, the network is considered <code>ON</code>.</p>

<p>From here, we can press a single button, to flip the state. This makes a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>/state</code> resource, with the desired new state.</p>

<p>I can build the app from my terminal to the Expo App on my phone via an <code>expo build:ios</code>. Once that’s done, I can open up the Expo app and control my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>Mission Accomplished!</p>

<h2 id="alright-im-sold-wheres-the-code">Alright I’m sold, where’s the code?</h2>

<p><img src="https://makeartwithpython.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/christmas-lights.gif" alt="Pressing the button"></p>

<p>All of the code is open source, and lives on <a href="https://github.com/burningion/minimum-viable-christmas-lights">Github</a>. I didn’t mention it, but there’s also a view in the Flask app you can visit in the browser to control the lights too. You can see it at the <code>/</code> url.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your app look better than mine, and share the results.</p>

<p>Happy holidays!</p>

December 24, 2020 | https://jeremybasso.dev/5-emerging-languages-and-frameworks-to-watch-in-2021 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeremybasso.dev/5-emerging-languages-and-frameworks-to-watch-in-2021">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>2020 has been an awesome year for developers, and we can expect 2021 to be the same. This is why I decided to share with you some of the languages and frameworks I expect to take over the world in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="deno">Deno</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608822461114/qkKraPGRu.png?auto=compress" alt="deno.png"></p>
<p>Deno is a runtime for Javascript launched this year. It has lived a fair amount of attention since the creator of Deno is known to be the creator of Node.js. One of the focuses of Deno is to rise where Node.js has difficulties. </p>
<p>Deno is completely written in Rust, using the V8 engine, and shows some impressive performance insights. </p>
<p>Here are some awesome pointers for Deno:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure by default: security is ensured by the runtime until you make some breaking changes</li>
<li>TypeScript support</li>
<li>Ships executable file</li>
<li>URL-based dependency management (no more npm or yarn)</li>
<li>very cool logo (I like dinosaurs)</li>
</ul>
<p>For all those reasons, the rise of Deno may be something to notice in 2021, and we can expect Deno to steal some light from Node.js in the future.</p>
<h2 id="kotlin">Kotlin</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608823329851/UC0BFqhX3.png?auto=compress" alt="kotlin_+.png"></p>
<p>Kotlin is a JVM-based language launched in 2017 by the fantastic company JetBrains. The idea is to keep concepts from Java while eliminating boiler-plates and improving the developer experience.</p>
<p>An interesting point is that Kotlin and Java are interoperable, meaning you can add Kotlin to your Java project, or Java to your Kotlin project (why would you do that ?).</p>
<p>Kotlin kept rising inside the Android ecosystem, becoming a supported language with Java and is now the main language for Android developers.</p>
<p>I have been using Kotlin for backend development for some years now, and I can ensure that the language is mature and I had a great developer experience. If you come from Java, there are high chances you will never go back to Java again after trying Kotlin.</p>
<p>Also, Kotlin Multi-Platform is a project to use Kotlin as a language for multi-platform development (iOS, Android, Web). While still being at an early stage, the project saw some great companies such as Netflix or VMWare give a try to Kotlin MP, which a sign of great potential.</p>
<p>Kotlin will keep rising in 2021, and you can expect it to take over the JVM-based languages.</p>
<h2 id="flutter">Flutter</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608824604977/w1ts7oclN.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="flutter-banner.jpg"></p>
<p>Flutter is an open-source SDK allowing users to develop mobile applications using only one codebase written in Dart. It was created by Google in 2015 and </p>
<p>Over the years, a lot of frameworks were created to avoid writing code for Android and for iOS by using one codebase instead: Xamarin, Ionic, Cordova, React Native ...
If you tried some of them, you may have seen some issues such as performances, or specific bugs on specific devices.</p>
<p>Flutter, even though it is not perfect, manages to solve some of those issues. </p>
<p>By using an ahead-of-time compilation, meaning before the execution, Flutter ensures high performances on devices. Maintaining a high FPS rate is not something rare in Flutter while being impossible in React Native as an example.</p>
<p>Also, Flutter is working at a very low level using C++ based libraries. Flutter directly writes on the screen using the Skia graphic library, thus maintaining performance.</p>
<p>In terms of developer experience, I suggest you all give it a try. With Flutter, you can create your UIs programmatically, enjoy features such as dev tools, or hot reload, which is really refreshing.</p>
<p>Flutter already some great app references, such as The New York Times, Tencent, or the Google Assistant, showing huge maturity.</p>
<p>We can expect Flutter to take over the multi-platform mobile development in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608825320545/pnRY3DYsd.png?auto=compress" alt="rust.png">
Rust is an open-source language created by Mozilla in 2010 and launched 1.0 in 2015.</p>
<p>The goal of Rust from the beginning is to be efficient, secure, and performing. The language kept improving for some years now, using the contributions of the community to build the roadmap.</p>
<p>Rust is now in a very good state, putting Rust as one of the best languages in terms of pure performance, making great use of concepts such as functional programming and concurrency. Rust is often mentioned as the successor of C and C++.</p>
<p>We can expect Rust to keep rising in 2021, and become one of the top languages.</p>
<h2 id="solidity">Solidity</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608826038695/ZJ4YVlCfc.png?auto=compress" alt="solidity.png"></p>
<p>Solidity is a language created in 2014 by the Ethereum Solidity team.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with blockchain, chances are high that you never heard about Solidity.</p>
<p>Solidity is an object-oriented language, mainly designed to write blockchain smart contracts. It is a leader from the start because it is one of the main languages for the Ethereum implementation, which is one of the top crypto-currencies currently (number two). </p>
<p>Some private blockchains are using Solidity as well, such as HyperLedger.</p>
<p>With the rise of ICO as a funding tool for crypto-currencies, Solidity developers became an essential resource. Indeed, for an Initial Coin Offering, you will need to write (at least on paper) implementation of your future currency, involving tech experts in the matter. </p>
<p>We can expect Solidity to keep rising in the developers market in 2021, with growth tied to the blockchain environment growth.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With Deno, Flutter, Kotlin, Rust, and Solidity, we have 5 strong contenders for the most high-potential languages and frameworks in 2021!</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if you think of some others!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading !</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>In CPython, types implemented in C actually are part of the type tree</h2>

	<p><small>December 24, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In Python, in theory all types descend from <code>object</code> (they are
direct or indirect subclasses of it). For years, I've believed (and
written) that this was not the case at the implementation level for
types written in native C code in CPython (the standard implementation
of Python and the one you're probably using). Types written in C
might behave as if they descended from <code>object</code>, but I thought their
behavior was actually entirely stand-alone, implemented by each
type separately in C. Courtesy of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">Python behind the scenes #6:
how Python object system works</a>,
I've discovered that I'm wrong.</p>

<p>In CPython, C level Python types are not literally subclasses of
the C level version of <code>object</code>, because of course C doesn't have
classes and subclasses in that sense. Instead, you usually describe
your type by defining a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html"><code>PyTypeObject</code></a> struct for it, with
all sorts of fields that you fill in or don't fill in as you need
them, including a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_base"><code>tp_base</code></a> field
for your base type (if you want more than one base type, you need
to take the alternate path of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#heap-types">heap type</a>). When
CPython needs to execute special methods or other operations on
your type, it will directly use fields on your <code>PyTypeObject</code>
structure (and as far as I know, it only uses those fields, with
no fallbacks). On the surface, this looks like the <code>tp_base</code> field
is essentially decorative and is only used to report your claimed
<code>__base__</code> if people ask.</p>

<p>However, there is a bit of CPython magic hiding behind the scenes.
In order to actually use a <code>PyTypeObject</code> as a type, you must
register it and make it ready by calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_Ready"><code>PyType_Ready</code></a>. As part
of this, <code>PyType_Ready</code> will use your type's <code>tp_base</code> to fill
in various fields of your <code>PyTypeObject</code> if you didn't already do
that, which effectively means that your C level type will inherit
those fields from its base type (and so on all the way up to
<code>object</code>). This is outlined in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#cols">a section of the C API</a>, but of course
I never read the C API myself because I never needed to use it.
The <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">how [the] Python object system works</a>
article has more details on how this works, if you're curious, along
with details on how special methods also work (which is more
interesting than I had any idea, and I've looked at this area
before).</p>

<p>(The distinction between what is considered a 'type' and what is
considered a 'class' by <code>repr()</code> is somewhat arbitrary; see the
sidebar <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ClassesAndTypes">here</a>. C level things defined with
<code>PyTypeObject</code> will probably always be considered types instead of
classes.)</p>

SPA view libraries like React have emerged in the past five or so years as an awesome way to handle that complexity on the client side, allowing developers to build interactive user-interfaces in a composable way, re-using components easily in different parts of the site.</p><h3 id="headline-2">Duplication of Concerns</h3><p>Generally, when building a React app, you get any dynamic data through a loosely coupled JSON API (in my personal preference, probably written with <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a>). If you're using a web framework like Django or Ruby on Rails, then you're going to have a lot of complexity and business logic on both the frontend and backend. Whenever you add a feature, you need to ask yourself where it should be added. The loose coupling between parts that may very well be written in different languages means that it's really difficult to share code, and even if you're doing something as simple as validating a form, you'll probably end up with a decent amount of duplicated business logic, a big no-no if you follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a>!</p><h3 id="headline-3">Data Fetching Boilerplate</h3><p>Loosely-coupled APIs present another challenge when building web apps: the boilerplate that comes along with getting the data out of your database and displayed in a browser. The general process for an SPA follows this outline:</p><ol><li><p>[User] Navigates to a page, submits a form, or clicks on a resource.</p></li><li><p>[Browser] Send a request, along with any route parameters and arguments, to a backend API endpoint.</p></li><li><p>[Server] API endpoint is called, fetches data from the database using the parameters in the request.</p></li><li><p>[Server] After retrieving data from the database, marshal that data into JSON to be sent back to the client.</p></li><li><p>[Browser] Receive JSON from request, un-marshal the JSON into data structures that the web app can understand.
For a React app, this would include passing the data as props to each component that uses the data to for render itself.</p></li></ol><p>And that's only the happy path! In the case of a validation error, for example, the server would return a 400 response with some JSON details, and the client again would need to catch that error, and render it properly. It really is a lot of boilerplate for any given request.</p><p>There are frontend libraries like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/">SWR</a> which factor out as much boilerplate as possible and encourage declarative patterns for your own data fetching, but "thick client" web apps will always need to marshal data to JSON on the server, and un-marshal to some view-able format on the client.</p><h2 id="headline-4">Managing SPA Complexity in 2020</h2><p>There's a bunch of different solutions to these problems for those who still want to provide an SPA experience, and they fall broadly into two separate categories.</p><h3 id="headline-5">Frontend-First: The JAMStack</h3><p>In recent years, there's been a big push towards the <a href="https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/">JAMStack</a>: pushing all your complexity and business logic onto your frontend, and relying mostly on commodified API services for your backend work. JSON is still the lingua franca here, but reliance on pre-built backends as a service for different functionalities, along with query languages like GraphQL, means that there isn't any backend boilerplate handled by developers. All the complexity and business logic is pushed to the client-side, which alleviates worries about duplication of concerns.</p><p>JAMStack and associated "micro-backends" like <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, or "backends-as-a-service" like <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a> allow people who haven't done too much backend work in the past to build truly full-stack apps on their own. <a href="https://m3o.com/">m3o</a> is even building a constellation of JAMStack-oriented "micro-services" to provide the batteries to power most web apps. Hmmâ€¦ "batteries included"? Where <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">have</a> we <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">heard</a> <a href="https://laravel.com/">that</a> <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">before</a>â€¦</p><h3 id="headline-6">Backend-First: Re-discovering the batteries</h3><p>MVC Frameworks like Django and Rails came about during the heyday of Web 2.0 to abstract away a lot of the boilerplate associated with building CRUD web applications, the exact issues that we spoke about above. Back in 2006, all those interactions were through normal browser HTTP requests. SPAs, built with anything from <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> or <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> to React and Vue, were more responsive. These web frameworks became frameworks for JSON API servers, and for many web app developers, functionality like Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/templates/">templates</a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/forms/#more-about-django-form-classes">forms</a> and the battle-tested <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/">abstractions</a> for linking them together became vestiges of an earlier age. Django's <code>Form</code> classes can render validation errors in templates with virtually no boilerplate written by developers. As soon as you want to put that form action over a JSON API, any responses from your server, which were previously just the HTML that the browser displayed, now have to be un-marshalled from JSON on the client and handled specifically. How much was Django really a "batteries included" framework if you needed to pull in <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">REST Framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit">OAuth Toolkit</a> whenever you wanted to work with a "modern" frontend?</p><p>Many people, myself included, enjoy modeling business logic in the ways Django and its ilk allow for. Backend-first fullstack frameworks have begun to proliferate built on top of these existing frameworks. <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">Phoenix LiveView</a> and <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a> are two that come to mind immediately, and have been around for a year or more.</p><p>On Monday, even the React Core team at Facebook threw their hat in the ring, with their <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html">Server Components</a> that have the opportunity to allow for React components to be rendered much like PHP templates, interspersing database calls and server-side JavaScript with the layout description inside a server component's <code>render</code> function.</p><p>These fullstack frameworks go a long way towards solving both of the concerns with traditional SPAs listed above. Separation of concerns is no longer an issue, since there is no separate, loosely coupled frontend codebase. Data fetching is drastically simpler in this paradigm. No longer does all your data need to be serialized to JSON before being converted into HTML; your data-fetching flow looks a lot more like this:</p><ol><li><p>[User] Navigates to a page, submits a form, etc.</p></li><li><p>[Server] Backend route is called, fetches/stores appropriate data from the database based on the request.</p></li><li><p>[Server] Data is used to populate an HTML template, which is sent to the client and rendered with the help of the framework.</p></li></ol><p>Your backend business logic renders HTML directly, completely replacing steps 3, 4 and 5 above with a single step: map your data into its visual representation in HTML. The two server steps remaining <em>are</em> the actual business logic in your application: the full-stack framework handles the smooth transitions, without the developer having to worry about serializing and de-serializing their own data. The logical flow of your application becomes a lot simpler for a single developer to follow and to handle.</p><p>Even React's Server Components fit this new paradigm: Data fetching no longer happens in AJAX requests, but by declaring a child server component which fetches the data and displays it in its own DOM tree without the developer having to serialize to/from JSON themselves. After the component renders on the backend, its virtual DOM gets sent to the frontend <em>by React itself</em> for display. The developer's interface into this whole process remains high-level and declarative.</p><h3 id="headline-7">As the Pendulum Swings</h3><p>We started the decade with frameworks like <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor.js</a> with extremely tight couplings between the client and server, and after a long time wandering in the wilderness of duplicated compelxity across loosely-coupled frontend and backend, it seems like we're entering the twenties with a renewed push towards a <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">more monolithic</a> approach to web development. When even a frontend framework like React is beginning to bridge the gap with the backend, you know it's an interesting idea to explore right now.</p><h2 id="headline-8">So what is Hotwire?</h2><p>The folks at Basecamp, the company behind Hotwire, have always been skeptical of thick clients with loads of JavaScript. Hotwire is Basecamp's latest answer to the challenge of building modern, responsive, "snappy" single-page applications where the domain logic lives entirely on the server. They used it to build out their new email service, Hey.com.</p><p>At Hotwire's core is <a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/">Turbo</a>, a new library that takes HTML from AJAX requests and dynamically modifies the currrent page. It comes out of an existing library called Turbolinks, now called "<a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/drive">Turbo Drive</a>" as of today, which is a utility that intercepts all click events on anchor tags, loads the resources over AJAX, and swaps out the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags, all while handling browser history.</p><p><a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/frames">Turbo Frames</a>, one of the new components, is pretty intriguing. Turbo Drive will still AJAX-ify form submissions and link clicks behind the scenes, but instead of swapping out the entire …</p></div></div>

		<div>
			<p>You’ve likely heard the saying: “A jack of all trades is a master of none.” It warns against the futility of pursuing too many disciplines. Be a specialist, or you’ll be nothing.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn there’s actually an extended version: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” With a subtle addition, its meaning becomes inverted to tout the benefits of being a polymath (a.k.a. generalist).</p>
<p>Why is the former so common, and the latter so unknown?</p>
<p>The answer lies in modern society’s preference for <strong>specialization</strong>. We’ll explore its origin, the limits it places on workers’ freedoms, and how the polymath approach can offer a reprieve. Finally, I’ll share my own experiences and learnings exploring a multitude of pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-specialization">Cost of Specialization</h2>
<p>Following unprecedented growth during the industrial revolution, businesses faced more competition than ever before. In order to thrive, they sought new ways to operate more efficiently and productively. Division of labor was the solution they were looking for. By dividing the tasks needed to produce goods and services, individual workers could focus on specific tasks rather than developing a variety of expertise.</p>
<p>One important criteria to optimize for specialization is ensuring that workers stay in the same role for prolonged periods of time. This facilitates increased efficiency by reducing the need for training and allowing individuals to iteratively improve their ability to perform similar tasks. In exchange for their loyalty, the company offers its employees the security of long-term employment, along with additional incentives including tax-sheltered retirement accounts and access to healthcare.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, these benefits come at a heavy cost to an individual’s freedom. In the United States for example, if you’re employed with a company, you get healthcare. Otherwise, you’re out of luck. Workers are often hesitant to switch jobs (let alone spend extended time without one) out of fear of losing their healthcare benefits. Another part of the problem is that the cost of healthcare in the U.S. is so high. A few days without healthcare and a single accident can push someone into financial ruin. As a result, many people stay at the same job year after year <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/25/more-than-half-of-us-workers-are-unhappy-in-their-jobs-heres-why-and-what-needs-to-be-done-now/#e8bfe3d20247" target="_blank">even if they’re unhappy</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of freedom might be a worthy sacrifice in exchange for job security. But therein lies the problem: few companies can actually guarantee long-term stability. Many workers already face ambiguity with their job security due to the impending effects of automation. Now, with the tornado of change brought about by the COVID pandemic, the brittleness of even large corporations’ stability has become apparent.</p>
<p>So how do we survive these waves of change? <strong>Adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>Workers need to embrace a life of learning and self-evolution in order to thrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again.
—Yuval Noah Harari</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, we have a template for how to do just that: the <strong>polymath</strong>.</p>
<p>Polymaths engage in extended learning across disparate fields, and apply their learnings to connect ideas and solve problems in unique ways. By nature, they’re well suited to thrive in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<h2 id="polymath-advantage">Polymath Advantage</h2>
<p>The key advantage that polymaths hold is their ability to develop <strong>mental models</strong> from different fields and apply them to solve problems in a unique way. This enables them to <strong>differentiate</strong> from their competition. Further, it creates opportunities for them to find truly <strong>meaningful work</strong> by pursuing their passions.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with specialization is that it becomes harder to compete over time. This is a bit counter-intuitive. At first you might think the more ‘specialized’ you become, the more ‘rare’ your skillset is and thus, the better you are in terms of competition. There are two issues that arise as you continue down the path of linear specialization:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Over-specialization</strong>: This often happens to PhD students who have pursued very niche, highly specific areas of expertise. It’s rare to find jobs that can actually serve their level of specialization. They find themselves given a choice to continue their career in academia, or take a less desirable job in the workforce that doesn’t actually leverage their unique skills.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Diminishing returns</strong>: The larger your team is, the more difficult it becomes to be the <em>absolute best</em> in a particular area. As a simple example: It’s quite difficult to become the most technically proficient engineer in a given company. However, it’s much more straightforward to differentiate yourself through excellent communication skills, design sensibilities, leadership skills, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you hit the diminishing returns of specialization on one pursuit (<strong>the limits of depth</strong>), it makes sense to expand to other pursuits and diversify your skills (<strong>the opportunities of breadth</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h3>
<p>When you work in a particular industry for a while, you start to develop mental models based on its structures and dynamics. These are widely known <em>within</em> the industry, but not as much outside of it.</p>
<p>There’s where the opportunity comes in. If you find yourself working in a new area later in your life, you can combine mental models from different areas in ways that few others can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler didn’t have a wealth of existing knowledge or technology to work with. There was no concept of gravity as a force, and he had no notion of momentum that keeps the planets in motion.</p>
<p>Analogies were all he had.</p>
<p>From research on magnets, Kepler began to understand why planets moved toward and away from the sun. By picturing how boats might move in a whirlpool, Kepler began to understand the elliptical orbit patterns of planets.</p>
<p>—David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more pursuits you expose yourself to, the more models you have to work from, and the more you can stand out from the competition.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I believe the strongest reason polymaths become polymaths is that they simply don’t have a choice. The urge to pursue one’s inner passions is strong, and those blessed with a variety of them often find them difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>The polymath’s search for meaning and purpose through different pursuits can be related to the Japanese concept of <em>Ikigai</em> (“a reason for being”):</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/18d8ec9ae04a2c4c035133ad9aab1f75d1df93f7/200f9/img/ikigai.jpg">
</p>
<p>It can take many years or even decades before one sees any intersection between different circles. Yet a single taste can be intoxicating, and motivate a lifetime of pursuit.</p>
<p>What purpose could be greater than discovering purpose itself?</p>
<h2 id="my-inner-fox">My Inner Fox</h2>
<p>When I first began to study polymaths, I was excited to see a template for a life I didn’t know I was living. But when I started to embrace the polymath identity, my inner critics appeared. I wondered whether I’m even qualified to write about polymaths, let alone call myself one. After all, the <a href="https://salman.io/notes/the-definition-of-a-polymath">the definition of a polymath</a> is somewhat murky. I’ve spoken to a lot of peers who feel this same hesitation, and it’s been refreshing to connect with others who are taking a similar approach to life.</p>
<p>I also got a boost of confidence from a book called <em>Hedgehog and the Fox</em> by Isaiah Berlin. The book is a major source of inspiration for the generalist approach, and contrasts two proverbial animals: the specialist hedgehog and the generalist fox. I was elated to discover that the spirit animal for my <em><a href="https://letter.salman.io/" target="_blank">Quick Brown Fox</a></em> newsletter (inspired by <em>The Little Prince</em>’s fox) was incredibly prescient. It seems my destiny as a polymath fox was written long ago…</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0450a5b1e748e81b5268216cb24537296d940d00/2e56c/img/fox.jpg">
</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky to have held a lot of different roles and explored a lot of varied interests in my life. I’ve been a startup founder, software engineer, manager, teacher, public speaker, advisor, DJ and writer. Some of these are roles I’ve explored for decades, while others for just a year. Beyond that, I’ve also spent a lot of time on artistic hobbies like illustration and animation. In hindsight, there were a number of benefits I enjoyed as a result of combining different pursuits.</p>
<p>As a DJ, I had to learn to not just play my playlist, but to pay close attention to the audience and cater to them. Looking back, I think <a href="https://soundcloud.com/daretodj" target="_blank">each one of my sets</a> was a live lesson on how to find product-market fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a46c9dc99267b1f6c2063c80a13243e7dca38bba/ef187/img/salman-dj.jpg">
</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://vimeo.com/134677777" target="_blank">obsession with animation</a>, I learned to incorporate the principles of animation into the software I built. Later, when I was building digital healthcare experiences, I was able to use animation to bring the patients’ user experience to life. I brought a different perspective to the healthcare world (specifically: the idea that filling out a form could be <strong>fun</strong>).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/134677777?autoplay=1">
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/70b053e6d9945d332a18b5ca6bca42ae4ff61e32/ee79e/img/animation-talk-preview.jpg">
  </a>
</p>
<p>Through extended <a href="https://medium.com/@salmansays/teaching-in-paradise-12159066cd86" target="_blank">teaching stints at software development schools</a>, I built strong communication skills that paid dividends in future public speaking engagements as well as all my daily interactions with coworkers. As it turns out, explaining our ideas is crucial to our effectiveness, and teaching provides excellent practice for this skill.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any of these things with a goal of being a polymath. I did them because <strong>I was drawn to them</strong>. It took many years before I started to see any benefits from mixing these pursuits.</p>
<p>Now that I’m intentionally embracing a polymath life, I hope to see the benefits compound even more. I’m excited to see how this plays out!</p>
<h2 id="freedom-isnt-free">Freedom Isn’t Free</h2>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about the benefits of the polymath lifestyle. I’d be remiss if I didn’t leave you with a few warnings about the obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the strange things about having multiple pursuits is that <strong>you never quite fit</strong> into social groups. I remember joining an iOS developers group where most of the members had been doing iOS development for more than a decade. Meanwhile, I had worked on countless platforms, in different roles across a variety of industries. We may have been in the same group, but we had lived completely different …</p></div></div></div>

Highly trained moral philosophers can have deep disagreements about them. Though I myself have studied ethics and political philosophy for much of my academic career, I am deeply grateful that I don't have to make those judgment calls. But for all of those difficulties, there are also some bedrock principles on which virtually all moral philosophers have long agreed.</p><p>The first is that we should avoid “leveling down” everyone’s quality of life for the purpose of achieving equality. It is unjust when some people have plenty of food while others are starving. But alleviating that inequality by making sure that an even greater number of people starve is clearly wrong. The second is that we should not use ascriptive characteristics like race or ethnicity to allocate medical resources. To save one patient rather than another based on the color of their skin rightly strikes most philosophers—and most Americans—as barbaric.&nbsp;The Centers for Disease Control have just thrown both of these principles overboard in the name of social justice.</p><p>In one of the most shocking moral misjudgments by a public body I have ever seen, the CDC invoked considerations of “social justice” to recommend providing vaccinations&nbsp;to essential workers before older Americans even though this would, according to its own models, lead to a much greater death toll. After a massive public outcry, the agency has adopted revised recommendations. But though these are a clear improvement, they still violate the two bedrock principles of allocative justice—and are likely to cause unnecessary suffering on a significant scale.</p><p>Since states will now have to decide whether to follow the CDC’s recommendations, the fight for a just distribution of the vaccine is not yet over. At the same time, the past days have already taught us two lessons that sum up some of the most worrying developments of the past years: The attack on philosophically liberal principles has by now migrated from leafy college campuses to the most important and powerful organizations in the country. And, in part as a result, it is getting harder and harder to trust institutions from the CDC to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><p><em>To learn more about Persuasion, <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-purpose-of-persuasion">read our founding manifesto</a>.</em></p><p>On November 23rd, Kathleen Dooling, a public health official at the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdf">gave a presentation</a> to the&nbsp;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&nbsp;(ACIP), which is tasked with developing the recommendation on who should first get access to the vaccine against Covid. In a stark departure from the course of action adopted in virtually every other developed democracy, Dooling recommended that 87 million essential workers—a very broad category including bankers and movie crews as well as teachers or supermarket cashiers—should get the vaccine before older Americans, even though the elderly are much more likely to die from the disease. The committee unanimously accepted the recommendations.</p><p>Dooling’s presentation laid out three different metrics for evaluating whether 87 million “essential workers” or Americans over the age of 65 should be next in line: feasibility, science, and ethics. According to the CDC's own evaluation, considerations of feasibility give us reasons to prioritize older Americans. This makes sense. It is both difficult to determine who should count as an essential worker and to communicate to people who do fall into that category that they are eligible. A straightforward age cut-off makes it easier to decide who's in and reach the target population. As a result, prioritizing the older than 65s leads by this metric.</p><p>Considerations of “science” also seemed to point in the same direction. As the presentation acknowledged, the likelihood of dying from Covid strongly depends on age. According to the CDC’s model, prioritizing essential workers over the elderly would therefore increase the overall number of deaths by between 0.5% and 6.5%. In other words, it would likely result in the preventable deaths of thousands of Americans.</p><p>And yet, the presentation concluded that science does <em>not</em> provide a reason to prioritize the elderly. For, as Kathleen Dooling wrote in one of the most jaw-dropping sentences I have ever seen in a document written by a public official, differences in expected consequences that could amount to thousands of additional deaths are “minimal.”</p><p>This allowed Dooling to focus on “ethical” principles in selecting the best course of action. Highlighting the most important consideration in red, Dooling emphasized that “racial and ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among adults &gt; 65.” In other words, America’s elderly are too white to be considered a top priority for the distribution of the vaccine against Covid. It is on this basis that ACIP awarded three times as many points to prioritizing the more racially diverse group of essential workers, making the crucial difference in the overall determination. Astonishingly, the higher overall death toll that would have resulted from this course of action does not feature as an ethical reason to prioritize older Americans.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F781c2d1d-4bc5-4578-86f1-330254e6936e_2556x1430.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F781c2d1d-4bc5-4578-86f1-330254e6936e_2556x1430.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/781c2d1d-4bc5-4578-86f1-330254e6936e_2556x1430.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:191902,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>In the days after ACIP published its preliminary recommendations, barely any epidemiologists or health officials publicly criticized its findings or its reasoning. But thankfully, prominent journalists like <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/will-the-us-snatch-defeat-from-the">Zeynep Tufecki</a>, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/vaccinate-elderly">Matt Yglesias</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1340361755403366400">Nate Silver</a> publicly made the case against them. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Yascha_Mounk/status/1340009058280103938">So did I</a>.)</p><p>It is, all of us acknowledge, very important to ensure that members of ethnic minorities are not excluded from access to the vaccine on the basis of their race. But to prioritize a 23-year-old Latino Uber driver who is very likely to weather infection with Covid over an 80-year-old white retiree who is likely to die from it because the former is part of a group that includes marginally more brown people and the latter is part of a group that includes marginally more white people is to inscribe racial discrimination at the heart of American public policy in an astonishing manner.</p><p>It gets even more shocking. The difference in the percentage of white people across age groups is comparatively small. The difference in the percentage of infected people who succumb to Covid across all age groups is massive. Giving the vaccine to African-American essential workers before elderly African-Americans would likely raise the overall death toll of African-Americans even if a somewhat greater number of African-Americans were to receive the vaccine as a result.</p><p>In other words,&nbsp;the CDC was effectively about to recommend that a greater <em>number</em> of African-Americans die so that the <em>share</em> of African-Americans who receive the vaccine is slightly higher.&nbsp;In blatant violation of the “leveling down objection,” prioritizing essential workers in the name of equality would likely kill more people in&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;relevant demographic groups.</p><p>As criticism of the recommendations mounted, epidemiologists mostly circled the wagon. But thankfully, the pressure was too strong to ignore. At a meeting that had, before the mounting controversy, been expected to rubber-stamp the recommendations that had already been unanimously accepted, ACIP changed course. It now suggested a more complicated scheme. Once medical workers had received the vaccine, both Americans over the age of 74 and essential <em>frontline</em> workers would be vaccinated; in a second phase, Americans over the age of 64 and the broader group of all remaining essential workers would get access to the vaccine.</p><p>Since over half of all deaths from Covid have so far occurred among Americans over the age of 74, this is an undoubted improvement over the initial guidance. But, for two reasons, it too probably sacrifices American lives on the altar of social justice. First, vaccinating Americans over the age of 74 <em>over the same period of time </em>as frontline essential workers will significantly delay when some of those who are at greatest risk will receive the vaccine. And second, starting to vaccinate Americans between the ages of 65 and 74 <em>after </em>30 million frontline essential workers will still put a large group with a comparatively low risk of death ahead of a large group with a significantly higher risk of death. </p><p>Just how many additional deaths will result from the ongoing refusal to prioritize those who are at the highest risk of dying? The CDC won’t tell us. In the updated presentation, Dooling once again claims that the difference between the CDC’s preferred course of action and a more strictly age-based approach is “minimal.” But this time around, ACIP has hidden the ball. The updated guidance, which was adopted with a 11-1 majority on December 20th, no longer includes an estimate of how many more people are likely to die if states follow its recommendation.</p><p><em>Get our articles directly into your inbox, and support the work of Persuasion, by <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/subscribe">becoming a subscriber</a>.</em></p><p>Over the past years, stories of campus craziness have frequently made the national news.

  <article>
    <p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/bye-social-media/cover.jpg"></p>

<p><span>N</span>ot long ago, we lived in small hunter-gatherer tribes. Social skills evolved along our abilities to use physical tools and language. We spent our days hunting or foraging our food, and had plenty of free time to ponder life. Our survival was dependent upon our social skills. We were rewarded (by the fruits of cooperation) for having friends and social support, and killed (mostly by hunger or predators) if we were antisocial. Our brains developed to be very sensitive to social interactions. The ability to read other’s emotions, give them importance, and respond to them is a part of our hard-wired social brain. It also takes a lot of mental energy.</p>

<p>In the early days of social media, I was (as is usual with me) an avid promoter and ethusiast. Social media is just <em>amazing</em> for so many things: exploring ideas, being up to date with many topics, connecting with tons of people. Social media helped me bootstrap my professional life, and meet some of the most amazing people. However, I’ve now come to believe that in a couple of years, most people will view using social media as unhealthy, like we do today with smoking. We might need to find better ways to get these benefits withtout the costs.</p>

<p>I stopped using Facebook ~3 years ago, and Instagram ~2 years ago. My online life has been much better since. My offline life too. Today (actually,&nbsp;a month ago), I left Twitter. The costs are simply too high for me. I noticed the less I use any of those apps, the calmer my mind, the more I read, and the more time I spend outside, in real contact with other people and nature. These are things I value more than instant access to news and daily contact with thousands of people at this time.</p>

<p>It is very hard to argue that social media is not harmful for most. We are simply not made to continually know what everyone else is doing or thinking, all the time! And it’s not a neutral tech. It is actively addictive and destructive to our volition. Most of the people I’ve talked to say they’d like to use these apps less. Yet somehow they don’t. Our brains are wired to pay attention to each other and to care about what others think about us. Social media is designed to exploit both these things. It is engineered to hook us in, and to influence our behavior. That’s the product Facebook, Instagram and Twitter sell to their customers: changing your ideas and behavior. And they got some pretty talented people working on that.</p>

<p>I don’t really think I can convince anyone to leave social media. I don’t even think it’s bad for everyone or that the benefits can’t outweigh the costs for some. I’m writing this post because many of you will already be close to leaving one of these apps. You’ve been thinking about it already. You’ve already made up your mind about it, and you’re waiting for the right moment. If just one person makes the final step into at least <em>trying</em> to live without social media, I’ll be happy.&nbsp;It has made a huge change for me. If you think this is stupid or I don’t understand the beauty of the Internet, I think you’ll change your mind in a few years. Or social media will ;)</p>

<p>If you do leave social media, feel free to contact me after a couple of months to share experiences. It’s been amazing for me, and I’m not going back. I’m really interested in knowing more about how this change can affect other people’s life. I’m also curious to find new ways to stay in touch with people outside my local community which are less toxic to my mind.</p>

<p>To close this brief post, I’ll share a bold prediction (and hope) on this topic: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will have less monthly active users in 2025 than today (~2.6 billion, ~1 billion, ~330 million, respectively). I added this to my <a href="https://maraoz.com/2016/03/20/2026/">predictions for 2026 post</a>.</p>

It is useful for things like:</p><ul><li>Turning an image grayscale, while keeping the perceived lightness the same</li><li>Increasing the saturation of colors, while maintaining perceived hue and lightness</li><li>Creating smooth and uniform looking transitions between colors</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, while there are color spaces that aim to be perceptually uniform, none are without significant drawbacks when used for image processing.</p><p>For this reason I have designed a new perceptual color space, designed to be simple to use, while doing a good job at predicting perceived lightness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness">chroma</a> and hue. It is called the <strong>Oklab color space</strong>, because it is an OK Lab color space.</p><p>Before diving into the details of why a new color space is needed and how it was derived, here is the everything needed to use the color space:</p><p>A color in Oklab is represented with three coordinates, similar to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> works, but with better perceptual properties.

If you need a simple perceptual color space, try it out.</p><p>The rest of the post will go into why a new color space was needed, how it has been constructed and how it compares with existing color spaces.</p><hr><p>What properties does a perceptual color space need to satisfy to be useful for image processing? The answer to this is always going to be a bit subjective, but based on my experience, these are a good set of requirements:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Should be an opponent color space</strong>, similar to for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a>.</li><li><strong>Should predict lightness, chroma and hue well</strong>. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> should be perceived as orthogonal, so one can be altered without affecting the other two. This is useful for things like turning an image black and white and increasing colorfulness without introducing hue shifts etc.</li><li><strong>Blending two colors should result in even transitions</strong>. The transition colors should appear to be in between the blended colors (e.g. passing through a warmer color than either original color is not good).</li><li><strong>Should assume a D65 whitepoint</strong>. This is what common color spaces like sRGB, rec2020 and Display P3 uses.</li><li><strong>Should behave well numerically</strong>. The model should be easy to compute, numerically stable and differentiable.</li><li><strong>Should assume normal well lit viewing conditions</strong>. The complexity of supporting different viewing conditions is not practical in most applications. Other models could be used in conjunction if this is needed in some case.</li><li><strong>If the scale/exposure of colors are changed, the perceptual coordinates should just be scaled by a factor</strong>. More complex models that depend on absolute luminance should be avoided since the viewing conditions can not be accurately controlled and incorrect behavior would be confusing.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="what-about-existing-models%3F">What about existing models? <a href="#what-about-existing-models%3F"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h3><p>Let’s look at existing models and how they stack up against these requirements. Further down there are graphs that illustrate some of these issues.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV">CIELUV</a></strong> – Largest issue is their inability to predict hue. In particular blue hues are predicted badly. Other smaller issues exist as well</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM02-UCS</a> and the newer CAM16-UCS</strong> – Does a good job at being perceptually uniform overall, but doesn’t meet other requirements: Bad numerical behavior, it is not scale invariant and blending does not behave well because of its compression of chroma. Hue uniformity is decent, but other models predict it more accurately.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSA-UCS">OSA-UCS</a></strong> – Overall does a good job. The transformation to OSA-UCS lacks an analytical inverse unfortunately which makes it impractical.</li><li><strong><a href="https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/2858/">IPT</a></strong> – Does a great job modelling hue uniformity. Doesn’t predict lightness and chroma well unfortunately, but meets all other requirements. Is simple computationally and does not depend on the scale/exposure.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-25-13-15131&amp;id=368272">JzAzBz</a></strong> – Overall does a fairly good job. Designed to have uniform scaling of lightness for HDR data. While useful in some cases this introduces a dependence on the scale/exposure that makes it hard to use in general cases.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSV</a> representation of sRGB</strong> – Only on this list because it is widely used. Does not meet any of the requirements except having a D65 whitepoint.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So, all in all, all these existing models have drawbacks.</p><p>Out of all of these, two models stand out: CAM16-UCS, for being the model with best properties of perceptual uniformity overall, and IPT for having a simple computational structure that meets all the requirements besides predicting lightness and chroma well.</p><p>For this reason it is reasonable to try to make a new color space, with the same computational structure as IPT, but that performs closer to CAM16-UCS in terms of predicting lightness and chroma. This exploration resulted in Oklab.</p><h3 id="how-oklab-was-derived">How Oklab was derived <a href="#how-oklab-was-derived"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h3><p>To derive Oklab, three datasets were used:</p><ul><li>A generated data set of pairs of colors with the same lightness but random hue and chroma, generated using CAM16 and normal viewing conditions.

<p>As we look upon the sunset of a remarkably tiresome year, I thought it would be appropriate to talk about <strong>cryptographic wear-out</strong>.</p>



<h3>What is cryptographic wear-out?</h3>



<p>It’s the threshold when you’ve used the same key to encrypt so much data that you should probably switch to a new key before you encrypt any more. Otherwise, you might let someone capable of observing all your encrypted data perform interesting attacks that compromise the security of the data you’ve encrypted.</p>

<p>The exact value of the threshold varies depending on how exactly you’re encrypting data (n.b. AEAD modes, block ciphers + cipher modes, etc. each have different wear-out thresholds due to their composition).</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the wear-out limits of the more popular <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/">symmetric encryption methods</a>, and calculate those limits ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="aes-gcm-limits">Cryptographic Limits for AES-GCM</h3>



<p>I’ve written about AES-GCM before (and <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">why I think it sucks</a>).</p>



<p>AES-GCM is a construction that combines AES-CTR with an authenticator called GMAC, whose consumption of nonces looks something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Calculating H (used in GHASH for all messages encrypted under the same key, regardless of nonce):<ul><li><code>Encrypt(00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000)</code></li></ul></li><li>Calculating J<sub>0</sub> (the pre-counter block):<ul><li>If the nonce is 96 bits long:<ul><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 00000001</code> where the <code>N</code> spaces represent the nonce hexits.</li></ul></li><li>Otherwise:<ul><li><code>s = 128 * ceil(len(nonce)/nonce) - len(nonce)</code></li></ul><ul><li><code>J0 = GHASH(H, nonce || zero(s+64) || int2bytes(len(nonce))</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Each block of data encrypted uses J0 + block counter (starting at 1) as a CTR nonce.</li><li>J0 is additionally used as the nonce to calculate the final GMAC tag.</li></ul>



<p>AES-GCM is one of the algorithms where it’s easy to separately calculate the safety limits per message (i.e. for a given nonce and key), as well as for all messages under a key.</p>



<h4>AES-GCM Single Message Length Limits</h4>



<p>In the simplest case (nonce is 96 bits), you end up with the following nonces consumed:</p>



<ul><li>For each key: <code>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</code></li><li>For each (nonce, key) pair:<ul><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000001</code> for J0</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000002</code> for encrypting the first 16 bytes of plaintext</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000003</code> for the next 16 bytes of plaintext…</li><li>…</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN FFFFFFFFF</code> for the final 16 bytes of plaintext.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>From here, it’s pretty easy to see that you can encrypt the blocks from <code>00000002</code> to <code>FFFFFFFF</code> without overflowing and creating a nonce reuse. This means that each (key, nonce) can be used to encrypt a single message up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D+-+2&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32} - 2" title="2^{32} - 2"> blocks of the underlying ciphertext.</p>



<p>Since the block size of AES is 16 bytes, this means the maximum length of a single AES-GCM (key, nonce) pair is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B36%7D+-+256&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{36} - 256" title="2^{36} - 256"> <strong>bytes</strong> (or 68,719,476,480 bytes). This is approximately 68 GB or 64 GiB.</p>



<p>Things get a bit tricker to analyze when the nonce is not 96 bits, since it’s hashed.</p>



<p>The disadvantage of this hashing behavior is that it’s possible for two different nonces to produce overlapping ranges of AES-CTR output, which makes the security analysis very difficult.</p>



<p>However, this hashed output is also hidden from network observers since they do not know the value of H. Without some method of reliably detecting when you have an overlapping range of hidden block counters, you can’t exploit this.</p>



<p>(If you want to live dangerously and motivate cryptanalysis research, mix 96-bit and non-96-bit nonces with the same key in a system that does something valuable.)</p>



<h4>Multi-Message AES-GCM Key Wear-Out</h4>



<p>Now that we’ve established the maximum length for a single message,  how many messages you can safely encrypt under a given AES-GCM key depends entirely on how your nonce is selected.</p>



<p>If you have a reliable counter, which is guaranteed to never repeat, and start it at 0 you can theoretically encrypt <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B96%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{96}" title="2^{96}"> messages safely. Hooray!</p>







<p>You probably don’t have a reliable counter, especially in real-world settings (distributed systems, multi-threaded applications, virtual machines that might be snapshotted and restored, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/2adic">2adic</a> for the expedient correction), you cannot safely encrypt more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> blocks with AES because the keystream blocks–as the output of a block cipher–cannot repeat.</p>



<p>Most systems that cannot guarantee unique incrementing nonces simply generate nonces with a cryptographically secure random number generator. This is a good idea, but no matter how high quality your random number generator is, random functions will produce collisions with a discrete probability.</p>



<p>If you have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5En&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^n" title="2^n"> possible values, you should expect a single collision(with 50% probability) after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{2^{n}}" title="\sqrt{2^{n}}"> (or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{n/2}" title="2^{n/2}">)samples. This is called the <strong>birthday bound</strong>.</p>



<p>However, 50% of a nonce reuse isn’t exactly a comfortable safety threshold for most systems (especially since nonce reuse will cause AES-GCM to become vulnerable to active attackers). 1 in 4 billion is a much more comfortable safety margin against nonce reuse via collisions than 1 in 2. Fortunately, you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">calculate the discrete probability of a birthday collision</a> pretty easily.</p>



<p>If you want to rekey after your collision probability exceeds <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{-32}" title="2^{-32}"> (for a random nonce between 0 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B96%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{96}" title="2^{96}">), you simply need to re-key after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> messages.</p>

<h3 id="chacha20poly1305-limits">Cryptographic Limits for ChaCha20-Poly1305</h3>



<p>The IETF version of ChaCha20-Poly1305 uses 96-bit nonces and 32-bit internal counters. A similar analysis follows from AES-GCM’s, with a few notable exceptions.</p>



<p>For starters, the one-time Poly1305 key is derived from the first 32 bytes of the ChaCha20 keystream output (block 0) for a given (nonce, key) pair. There is no equivalent to AES-GCM’s H parameter which is static for each key. (The ChaCha20 encryption begins using block 1.)</p>



<p>Additionally, each block for ChaCha20 is 512 bits, unlike AES’s 128 bits. So the message limit here is a little more forgiving.</p>



<p>Since the block size is 512 bits (or 64 bytes), and only one block is consumed for Poly1305 key derivation, we can calculate a message length limit of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B38%7D+-+64&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{38} - 64" title="2^{38} - 64">, or 274,877,906,880 bytes–nearly 256 GiB for each (nonce, key) pair.</p>



<p>The same rules for handling 96-bit nonces applies as with AES-GCM, so we can carry that value forward.</p>

<h3 id="chacha20poly1305-limits">Cryptographic Limits for XChaCha20-Poly1305</h3>



<p>XChaCha20-Poly1305 is a variant of XSalsa20-Poly1305 (as used in libsodium) and the IETF’s ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction. It features 192-bit nonces and 32-bit internal counters.</p>



<p>XChaCha20-Poly1305 is instantiated by using HChaCha20 of the key over the first 128 bits of the nonce to produce a subkey, which is used with the remaining nonce bits using the aforementioned ChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>This doesn’t change the maximum message length, but it <em>does</em> change the number of messages you can safely encrypt (since you’re actually using up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> distinct keys).</p>



<p>Thus, even if you manage to repeat the final ChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce, as long as the total nonce differs, each encryptions will be performed with a distinct key (thanks to the HChaCha20 key derivation; see the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/xsalsa-20110204.pdf">XSalsa20 paper</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xchacha-03">IETF RFC draft</a> for details).</p>

<h3>Cryptographic Limits for AES-CBC</h3>



<p>It’s tempting to compare non-AEAD constructions and block cipher modes such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), but they’re totally different monsters.</p>



<ul><li>AEAD ciphers have a clean delineation between message length limit and the message quantity limit</li><li>CBC and other cipher modes do not have this separation</li></ul>



<p>Every time you encrypt a block with AES-CBC, you are depleting from a <strong>universal</strong> bucket that affects the birthday bound security of encrypting more messages under that key. (And unlike AES-GCM with long nonces, AES-CBC’s IV is public.)</p>



<p>This is in addition to the operational requirements of AES-CBC (plaintext padding, initialization vectors that never repeat <em>and</em> must be unpredictable, separate message authentication since CBC doesn’t provide integrity and is vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext atacks, etc.).</p>

<p>For this reason, most cryptographers don’t even bother calculating the safety limit for AES-CBC in the same breath as discussing AES-GCM. And they’re right to do so!</p>



<p>If you find yourself using AES-CBC (or AES-CTR, for that matter), you’d best be performing a separate HMAC-SHA256 over the ciphertext (and verifying this HMAC with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#string-comparison">a secure comparison function</a> before decrypting). Additionally, you should consider using <a href="https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption/blob/master/docs/CryptoDetails.md">an extended nonce construction to split one-time encryption and authentication keys</a>.</p>







<p>However, for the sake of completeness, let’s figure out what our practical limits are.</p>



<p>CBC operates on entire blocks of plaintext, whether you need the entire block or not.</p>



<p>On encryption, the output of the previous block is mixed (using XOR) with the current block, then encrypted with the block cipher. For the first block, the IV is used in the place of a “previous” block. (Hence, its requirements to be non-repeating <em>and</em> unpredictable.)</p>



<p>This means you can informally model (IV xor PlaintextBlock) and (PB<sub>n</sub> xor PB<sub>n+1</sub>) as a pseudo-random function, before it’s encrypted with the block cipher.</p>



<p>If those words don’t mean anything to you, here’s the kicker: You can use the above discussion about birthday bounds to calculate the upper safety bounds for the <strong>total</strong> number of blocks encrypted under a single AES key (assuming IVs are generated from a secure random source).</p>



<p>If you’re okay with a 50% probability of a collision, you should re-key after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> blocks have been encrypted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				

				
				
	<p>I, as a person who tries to use cutting edge technology, am a Wayland
user, and ever since I started using it, I haven’t been able to get
the thoughts about its problems out of my head. It’s time to get this
thing off my chest. Here are the reasons Wayland is still not here:</p>
<h2 id="the-main-problem">The main problem</h2>
<p>You may think that it’s the fact that it was decided to move from the
“there’s only 1 display server” idea. You’re wrong, as that would
invalidate the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">core goals</a> of the project - to be just a protocol
that requires implementations.</p>
<p>What can’t be denied, however, is the fact that instead of creating a
full-featured “batteries included” set of protocols and a reference
implementation of a library, compositors based on which could compete
with X by being just as feature complete, there was created only a
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston" title="weston">simple compositor</a>, which can only satisfy the needs of a kiosk and
not a modern desktop environment. An unofficial version of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/" title="wlroots">such a
library</a> didn’t even appear until 2017.</p>
<h2 id="the-consequences-it-has">The consequences it has</h2>
<h3 id="feature-incompleteness">Feature incompleteness</h3>
<p>After 12 years of development, the implementations of the protocol
still have a series of features incompletely implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color management -
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/14">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/pull/2353">2</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1360">3</a>,
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/issues/11">4</a></li>
<li>Variable refresh rate support -
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/84">1</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1154">2</a>,
<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405912">3</a></li>
<li>High bit depth display support -
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/1378">1</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1391">2</a></li>
<li>DRM leasing -
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/49">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/1723">2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/14">Screencasting</a></li>
<li><a href="https://community.teamviewer.com/English/discussion/26340/state-of-wayland-teamviewer">Remote desktop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool">Input simulation and window control</a></li>
<li>Client-side global hotkey binding</li>
<li>Nvidia GPU support - yes it is indeed Nvidia’s fault, but to the
end user it makes no difference</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it’s not so many, and the partial fault here is on
clients rather than servers.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-difficulty">Implementation difficulty</h3>
<p>On the server side, while it’s true that Wayland makes implementing a
display server much easier, implementing a window manager is still a
nightmare. For example, even using a library, you need to write <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/tree/master/tinywl" title="tinywl">a
thousand lines of code</a> to implement the absolute bare bones
compositor, which won’t even support such critical things as damage
tracking, hi-DPI, graphical tablets, multiseat, and any input/output
configuration. X, on the other hand, allows you to write as few as <a href="http://incise.org/tinywm.html" title="tinywm">50
lines of code</a> because it handles most of things such as the ones
listed itself.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-standardization">Lack of standardization</h3>
<p>Wayland’s <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/">core set of protocols</a> while covering a wide range things,
doesn’t provide ones needed to build a modern desktop environment such
as a desktop shell protocol (to build such things as panels and
launchers), a protocol to simulate input and control windows, a
protocol to control the clipboard, and others, leaving that to the
compositors. While <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/" title="wlr-protocols">such a set of protocols</a> does exist, it’s not
adopted by the majority of the compositors. A similar problem is
happening to <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal" title="xdg-desktop-portal">the set of protocols</a> required to screenshot, screencast
and remote desktop - the adoption by clients is extremely low. This
makes working with Wayland and debugging it much less flexible and
compositor-dependable than X, and makes developing clients even
harder.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-configurability">Lack of configurability</h3>
<p>In contrast to X.org, which has <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/xorg.conf">a unified config system</a>, each
Wayland compositor has to implement configuration separately. This
results in not only inconvenience when trying to move the config from
one compositor to another or describing how to configure something,
but also different feature coverage by different compositors. For
example, a compositor may not implement an input configuration such as
scrolling speed or graphical tablet mapping or an output configuration
such as display bit depth. <a href="https://github.com/Hjdskes/cage/issues/138">In some cases</a> the compositor may not even
implement any input configuration, which makes using it extremely
problematic, especially considering such a problem doesn’t exist when
using X.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Considering the listed problems, the Wayland’s future doesn’t look
that bright. But don’t give up hope just yet, as long as we have
projects like wlroots pushing the innovation, not everything is lost!</p>

  <p><span>07 Jun 2020</span></p><p><img src="https://pratikone.github.io/public/images/speech_bubble1.png" alt="bubble" title="Image source : https://pixabay.com/illustrations/speech-bubble-thinking-talk-5775045/" height="auto" width="30%"></p>

<p>Java has a runtime. We have seen countless times to install or update JRE - Java Runtime environment. Python too has runtime. It is provided by the python executable. But what about C ? Does it have a runtime ? I have never come across a C runtime installer. How about C++ ?<br>
The short answer is <strong>YES</strong>. <br>
C has a runtime, albeit a tiny one and C++ also has a runtime. We don’t notice it because it is usually provided by the OS itself and with every new OS update, it gets updated. There is a small exception with that (VC runtime library on Windows) but we will talk about it later. Let’s get to the basics.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-c-runtime-crt-">What is C runtime (CRT) ?</h2>
<p>Whenever we refer to C runtime, we usually mean one or both of these things:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Bootstrap and Runtime environment</em>  : It sets up the necessary bootstrapping code which tells the OS how to run this binary code, followed by code for setting up the runtime environment for executing user code. It is included as inline assembly in the compiled binary itself.</li>
  <li><em>Runtime library</em> : it contains functions to interact with the OS; functions to allocate memory, read and write to files, network etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="bootstrap-and-c-runtime-environment">Bootstrap and C runtime environment</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, this is the code which sets up the execution point for the program for the OS to call. It defines the structure of functions, setup call stack and its calling convention (_stdcall, __cdecl ). This is the most important and necessary code to run our program in the OS.  It is specific to the OS version and doesn’t usually change but gets updated by the OS itself during its update. Among those dozens of Windows update we receive regularly, some of them update the CRT too.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b2d86d471d92.png" alt="winupdate" title="Please wait while Windows is updating ..." height="auto" width="50%"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0"><code>crt0</code></a> is a special file which gets linked to every program during the linking phase of compilation. It has basic program loading routines which instruct the compiler on how to call this program’s <code>main()</code> function and even exit the running program. Like everything else in the C and C++ ecosystem, there is a flexibility of choice on including it. If one wants to write his/her own startup code, they can avoid linking to crt0 altogether (<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html">nostartfiles</a> in GCC) and just provide their code in <code>_start</code> label in assembly (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29694564/what-is-the-use-of-start-in-c"><code>_start</code> calls <code>main()</code> of user code</a>). 
In case of C++, <code>crt1</code> can be linked alternatively,  which provides some extra functionality for constructor and destructors.</p>

<h3 id="c-runtime-library">C runtime library</h3>
<p>The runtime library or standard library (<code>stdlib</code>) contains a series of useful functions like <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>memcpy</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference?view=msvc-160">MSVC</a>, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">GCC</a> ) for interacting with the OS which almost every program needs. This part can be statically or dynamically linked. Windows provides libcmt.lib for C and libcpmt.lib for C++. 
If one chooses to link it statically, only the code called by the user’s program gets added to its binary, increasing the size. Removing stdlib can significantly reduce the binary size, which could be as significant as 90% in tiny programs. If one has to create the C code binary with smallest size, this would be the key step in reducing binary size to ~ 1 kb.</p>

<p>If one dynamically links to CRT, this size bump is not there (it is standard for programs to dynamically link to this library for multiple reasons like compatibility with other dll, apart from small size saving). Every OS provides an implementation. <code>UCRT.dll</code> on Windows and <code>libc.so</code> (GLibc) on Linux.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normal dynamic loading of dll rule applies : If the program loads two different versions of CRT dll, they won’t share global variables. Not taking care of this fact could cause very subtle bugs in multi-dll codebases,  in calling runtime functions which maintain any state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A user code cannot be faster than its runtime library’s performance.
Runtime libraries keep getting improvements through updates and one can receive those fixes as part of VC++Runtime updates on Windows or libc updates on Linux. Programs compiled with a specific CRT lib may expect that specific or compatible CRT dll. Thus, it is possible to keep side by side copies of different versions of CRT dlls (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL hell ?</a>).</p>

<h2 id="all-you-need-is-c">All you need is C</h2>
<p>C runtime is an interesting piece of software - it depends not only on OS and architecture but also on compiler. To give an example, runtime code generated on 64 bit windows by GCC would be different from that generated by MSVC. 
If you want to port C to a brand new OS,  all you need apart from the compiler is a working C runtime and that’s it, C gets ported.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far. For the last couple of months, I have been interested in inner workings of C and C++ ecosystem. This is an article in that direction. Tweet any suggestions or corrections to me at <a href="https://twitter.com/pratikone">@pratikone</a></p>

Instead, each node on the Ethereum mainnet has its own pool of transactions and, combined, they all form the global pool.</p><p>The thousands of pending transactions that enter the global pool by being broadcast on the network and before being included in a block are an always changing data set that’s holding millions of dollars at any given second.</p><p>There’s a lot that one can do hereâ€”and many do and make this txpool business a highly competitive market.</p><p>A few examples, listed in the order of inconspicuous to contentious:</p><ul><li>Yield farming â€” you can watch the transactions movement between DeFi applications to be one of the first to detect the yield farming profitability changes.</li><li>Liquidity providing â€” you detect the potential liquidity movements in and out of DeFi applications and act on the changes.</li><li>Arbitrage â€” you can detect the movement of transactions that will affect token prices at different DEXes and make your arbitrage trades based on that.</li><li>Front running â€” you can automatically grab the existing pending transactions, simulate them to identify the potential profit if the transaction is executed, copy the transaction and swap the existing address with your own, and submit it with a higher miner fee so that your transaction gets executed on-chain before the one you are copying.</li><li>Doing a MEV â€” MEV stands for Miner Extractable Value, and it’s based on that miners are theoretically free to include any transactions in the blocks and/or reorder them. This is a variation of the front running where instead of submitting your transaction with a higher fee to the same pool you picked it from, you get it directly into a block through a miner and bypass the pool.</li></ul><p>To run any of the described scenarios, you need access to the Ethereum txpool, and you need the methods to retrieve the transactions from the txpool. While Chainstack has you covered with fast dedicated nodes for the former, this article focuses on all the ways you can look into the txpool.</p><h2>Retrieving pending transactions with Geth</h2><p>Since pending transactions are your targets in the txpool space, we are now going to make this a structured effort and focus on answering the following questions while accompanying the answers with practical examples:</p><ul><li>How do I retrieve pending transactions?</li><li>Why do I view global or local pending transactions?</li><li>Can I view global pending transactions without txpool namespace?</li></ul><p>There are a few ways to retrieve pending transactions.</p><ul><li>Filters</li><li>Subscriptions</li><li>Txpool API</li><li>GraphQL API</li></ul><p>Before we start, lets clarify a few things:</p><ul><li><strong>Global pending transactions</strong> refer to pending transactions that are happening globally, which includes your newly created local pending transactions.<br><strong>Local pending transactions</strong> refer strictly to the transactions that you created on your local node. Note that you need â€˜personalâ€™ namespace enabled for Geth to send local transactions.</li><li><strong>Pending transactions</strong> refer to transactions that are pending due to various reasons, like extremely low gas, out of order nonce, etc.</li><li>Chainstack is using <strong>Geth (Go Ethereum)</strong> client.</li></ul><h3>Filters</h3><p>When we create a filter on Geth, Geth will return a unique <code>filter_id</code>. Do note that this <code>filter_id</code> will only live for 5 minutes from the last query on that specific filter. If you query this filter after 5 minutes, the filter will not exist anymore.</p><h4>Creating a pending transaction filter and retrieving data from it</h4><h5>cURL</h5><p><strong>Create filter</strong></p><p>Request body:</p><pre><code>'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_newPendingTransactionFilter","params":[],"id":73}'</code></pre><p>Response body:</p><pre><code>{ "id":73, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "0xb337f6e2f833ecffc6e9315ba06cd03d" }</code></pre><h5>Web3.js</h5><p>Filter for pending transactions is not supported anymore.

If we look at the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/blob/72457e6f9f3cb6d51fe492d1a65bed7904639760/web3/eth.py#L474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">web3.py source code</a>, when web3.py receives a string pending, it will be mapped to <code>eth_newPendingTransactionFilter</code>, and when web3.py receives a dictionary, it is mapped to <code>eth_newFilter</code>.</p><p>To add to this, web3.py has <code>get_new_entries</code> as well as <code>get_all_entries</code> for filters but <code>get_all_entries</code> does not work in our case. This is because <code>eth_newPendingTransactionFilter</code> does not have <code>get_all_entries</code> available for it.</p><h4>From latest block to pending block filter</h4><p>Why doesn’t the following filter give me real-time pending transactions?</p><pre><code>web3.eth.filter({'fromBlock': 'latest', 'toBlock': 'pending'})</code></pre><p>A filter only returns <code>new_entries()</code> when the state has changed. This specific filter state changes only when there is a new latest block or pending block. Thus, you will only receive changes when there is a new latest block or pending block, i.e. <code>(eth.getBlock('latest') / pending)</code>.</p><h4>The getPendingTransactions filter</h4><p>Why is the following giving me a different or empty result?</p><pre><code>web3.eth.getPendingTransactions().then(console.log)</code></pre><p>This function is mapped to <code>eth.pendingTransactions</code> which is a function to check local pending transactions and does not give you global transactions.</p><p>Based on the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/ead814616c094331915b03edd82d4200a7880178/internal/ethapi/api.go#L1700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geth source code</a>, only <code>pendingTransactions</code> that has its <code>from</code> field matching with your personal account will be shown.</p><h3 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h3><p>Subscriptions is real-time streaming of data from server to client through WebSocket. You will need a constantly active connection to stream such events. You cannot use curl for this and have to use a WebSocket client like <a href="https://github.com/vi/websocat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">websocat</a> if you want to access it via command line. Once executed, a stream of pending transaction IDs will start flowing in.</p><p>For other supported subscriptions, check the Geth documentation: <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/pubsub#supported-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Supported Subscriptions</a>.</p><h4>Creating a subscription</h4><h5>Websocat</h5><p><strong>Connect to node</strong></p><pre><code>websocat wss://username:<a href="https://chainstack.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8cfcedfffffbe3fee8ccfbffa1e2e8a1bdbebfa1b8b9baa1bbb4b5a2fcbefce5eaf5a2efe3e1">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre><p><strong>Create subscription</strong></p><p>Request body:</p><pre><code>{"id": 1, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["newPendingTransactions"]}</code></pre><p>Response body:</p><pre><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x2d4f3eb938cdb0b6fa9052de7c4da5de"}</code></pre><p><strong>Incoming stream</strong></p><pre><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_subscription","params":{"subscription":"0x2d4f3eb938cdb0b6fa9052de7c4da5de","result":"0xee426dbaef2a432d0433d5de600347e97b6a8a855daf8765c18cf1b7efc53461"}}
...</code></pre><h3>Txpool API</h3><p>Txpool is a Geth-specific API namespace that keeps pending and queued transactions in the local memory pool. Geth’s default is 4096 pending and 1024 queued transactions. However, <a href="https://etherscan.io/txsPending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Etherescan reports</a> a much bigger number of pending transactions. If we view Geth’s txpool, we will not be able to get all of the transactions. Once the pool of 4096 is full, Geth replaces older pending values with newer pending transactions.</p><p>If you need a bigger pool to be stored on your node, the flag <code>--txpool.globalslots</code> can be adjusted to a higher value on <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geth CLI options</a>. Do note that the larger the number, the bigger the payload size.</p><p>If you see your <code>txpool_status</code> to be empty, it can mean your node has not fully synced.</p><p>The txpool namespace is only supported on Chainstack dedicated nodes.</p><h4>Creating a txpool filter</h4><h5>cURL</h5><p><strong>Create filter</strong></p><p>Request body:</p><pre><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_newPendingTransactionFilter","params":[],"id":73}</code></pre><p>Response body:</p><pre><code>{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 73, "result": { "pending": {...}, "queued": {...} } }</code></pre><h5>Web3.js</h5><p><a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0-alpha/web3-eth-txpool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TxPool Module</a>.</p><h5>Web3.py</h5><p><a href="https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.geth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geth API</a>.</p><h3>GraphQL API</h3><p>The biggest advantage of <a href="https://chainstack.com/graphql-on-ethereum-availability-on-chainstack-and-a-quick-rundown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using GraphQL</a> is that you can filter out the specific fields of the transaction that you want. The query in GraphQL goes through the elements within the txpool. Thus, its limitations are the same as the ones of txpool as stated above.</p><p>The following is an example which shows the information of a pending transaction.</p><p>Query example:</p><pre><code>query {

  <!-- INSERT LATCH HTML -->
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/">blog</a> | <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">oilshell.org</a></p>

<p>
  2020-12-23
</p>
<p>I usually don't post videos here, but the first one in this series <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/khec43/video_derivative_of_a_regex_brzozowski_derivative/">got a
positive reaction on Reddit</a>, and there are two more.</p>
<p>I've been interested in implementing simple and efficient <strong>regex matching</strong>
with the derivatives technique for a couple years. But I haven't had time to
play with code that implements it, or read the original papers more carefully.</p>
<p>These videos helped me understand the technique despite the fact I haven't
done math in over a decade.  Others apparently felt the same way.  The
explanation is simple but not dumbed down.</p>
 
<a name="context"></a>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>For context, see the two July 2020 posts  tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a>,
particularly <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/07/ideas-questions.html#regular-expression-derivatives-papers-and-code">this part of the second post, on derivatives</a>.</p>
<p>Summary: A 2009 paper revived this regex matching technique.  There have been
many implementations since, though no popular ones.</p>
<a name="how-does-this-relate-to-shell"></a>
<h3>How Does This Relate to Shell?</h3>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned in those posts, a <strong>glob</strong> like <code>[a-c]*.py</code> is essentially a
limited form of regex.
<ul>
<li>I noted in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491467">this Hacker News comment</a> that the obscure
"extended glob" feature of bash gives globs the power of regular
expressions, by adding repetition and alternation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It would be nice if <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">egg expressions</a> could be <strong>compiled</strong> to a
full DFA in C, as we do in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=lexing#lexing">Oil's lexer</a> via <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=re2c#re2c">re2c</a>.
<ul>
<li>This seems doable, and the author of an <a href="https://github.com/jack-pappas/facio/tree/master/Reggie">F# compiler
toolkit</a> relays
valuable experience at the bottom of the thread.  I'd like to do the same
thing without the .NET runtime, depending only on code in Oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It would be nice if <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">egg expressions</a> weren't limited to the
features of the pattern matching engine in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=libc#libc">libc</a>.  Non-greedy
capturing like <code>foo.*?bar</code> would be nice, although capturing and matching are
two different problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>EasyTheory Videos</h2>
<a name="derivative-of-a-regex-brzozowski-derivative"></a>
<h3>Derivative of a Regex?! (Brzozowski Derivative)</h3>
<p>This video explains what a derivative is using the recursive definition of
regular expressions.</p>

<a name="example"></a>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This one walks through an example of a regex and its derivative.</p>

<a name="regex-to-dfa-directly-using-brzozowski-derivatives-no-nfa"></a>
<h3>Regex to DFA Directly Using Brzozowski Derivatives (No NFA)</h3>
<p>This one shows how to directly convert a regular expression to a DFA with
derivatives.  This is interesting because DFAs can be executed efficiently.
See the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/khec43/video_derivative_of_a_regex_brzozowski_derivative/">Reddit thread</a> for more color on this.</p>

<a name="why-call-this-operation-a-derivative"></a>
<h2>Why Call This Operation a Derivative?</h2>
<p>I don't know, and the videos don't explain it!  I assume there is some
connection between algebra and calculus.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/khec43/video_derivative_of_a_regex_brzozowski_derivative/">Reddit thread</a> has some speculation on this.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/kj6svq/three_great_videos_about_regex_derivatives/?">Leave a
comment</a> if you have ideas.</p>
<p>I recently explained that <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/k5yj4c/modern_parser_generator/geiew2e/">languages are sets, not algorithms</a>.
And MathOverflow says that <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1574197">derivatives can be expressed in set
theory</a>.  But I don't know if that's
a useful way to think about it.</p>
<a name="more-info"></a>
<h2>More Info</h2>
<ul>
<li>These videos are part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyTheory/videos">EasyTheory
channel</a>, which started 9 months
ago, and has many videos that go deeply into the theory of computation.
<ul>
<li>Caveat: this is pure theory, and I'm mainly interested in <strong>engineering
consequences</strong>, like compiling with fewer lines of code and executing
efficiently.  Posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=computer-science#computer-science">computer-science</a> explain other
such connections.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our teams are working to coordinate the many individuals and organizations that have offered to help advance The Rocky Linux Foundation, Inc. (Rocky Linux). The core team is working to lay the infrastructure that will support the legal entity and the engineering efforts required to deliver and support an initial release. Updates regarding project news, release dates, and more will be announced on our <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a>, <a href="https://rockylinux.org/">website</a>, and <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/all-rocky-linux-links/833">other social media platforms</a>.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Transparency with the community and for those that will be relying on Rocky Linux to supplant their CentOS 8 installations before support expiration is paramount. We will soon be communicating a timeline for the delivery of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build systems and infrastructure readiness</li>
<li>Automatic package build infrastructures</li>
<li>When the testing package repository will be made public</li>
<li>Installer testing readiness</li>
<li>ETA for length of time needed for community testing</li>
<li>Release candidate availability</li>
</ul>
<p>We are targeting Q2 2021 to deliver our first release of Rocky Linux, made available not only in standard commercial regions, but also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us">GovCloud</a>, and China.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the past three weeks, here is some of the progress we’ve made:</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have selected and vetted auditing, logging, and user account management tooling.</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS):
<ul>
<li>The team selected AWS as the primary build platform for development of Rocky Linux. AWS was chosen primarily to protect the integrity of the software supply chain for Rocky Linux.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, donated hardware and rack space isn’t sufficient to meet our supply chain integrity needs.</li>
<li>Traditional physical hardware separate from our production build environment will still be necessary, and we expect a large portion of our infrastructure will exist outside of AWS for the purposes of business continuity, cost, and platform agnosticity.</li>
<li>We have outlined an infrastructure to best secure and facilitate our engineering efforts using multiple VPCs, subnets, and regions for high availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Centers:
<ul>
<li>We are negotiating with several data center providers for the secure hosting of our physical infrastructure.</li>
<li>After we have our physical infrastructure provider solidified, we will reach back out to those that have offered to donate hardware .</li>
<li>Discussions with the Oregon State University Open Source Lab (<a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSUOSL</a>) regarding resources are in the works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The core tenets of the Infrastructure Team are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide a platform for the automatic and secure builds of packages and components which will allow for community participation without sacrificing security or trust in the resulting packages</li>
<li>The integrity of the build pipeline and software supply chain are paramount.</li>
<li>Be as vendor and platform agnostic as possible. Avoid vendor lock-in.</li>
<li>Be transparent with the community, to the extent possible and practical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Engineering and Packaging</h2>
<ul>
<li>The build process for Rocky Linux will use <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji">Koji</a> and <a href="https://pagure.io/fm-orchestrator/tree/master">MBS</a>.</li>
<li>We are developing scripts and build tools to create a pipeline that allows pulling sources, debranding, and building through Koji and <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki">Mock</a>.</li>
<li>The progress of proof of concepts and processes utilized by the Rocky Linux build process, including all errors and dependencies, is being documented in the <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/Development">wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Security team has drafted a Data Classification Policy, which will be made available for public comment pending review.</li>
<li>Groups, members, and permissions structures for the build infrastructure have been laid out for review and evaluation.</li>
<li>In parallel with the infrastructure team, we have architected and designed AWS network and security topologies aligned with best practices and security standards.</li>
<li>Work has started on OpenSCAP documents for popular STIGs.</li>
<li>Plans are being made with the goal of Rocky Linux becoming FIPS compliant.</li>
</ul>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>On the surface, software engineering interviews look pretty much the same in any company. You usually have a phone call with a recruiter, followed by either a short technical round or a set of take home exercises. If you pass that you're invited for several rounds of on-site interviews, focusing on your technical abilities and behavioral cues that could predict your job performance and how you'll get along with the team.</p><p>However, if you simply take this format, pick a set of technical questions for the specific role and go with it, you could soon find yourself thinking about how to improve the process. You might find it slow and tedious for the interviewers; you could start seeing evaluations for the same candidate that widely differ depending on the interviewer; you could get feedback from the candidates that the process requires too much of a time investment for them.</p><p>In this post we'll summarize lessons shared on official engineering blogs of several companies. Namely, the advice falls down into three sections:</p><ol><li>Know what you are looking for</li><li>Be ready to iterate</li><li>Techniques to avoid bias</li></ol><p>If you're curious and want to find more stories about engineering interviews and hiring process, you should try <a href="https://blogboard.io/search?searchQuery=engineering%20interviews">Blogboard search</a>.</p><h2 id="know-what-you-are-looking-for">Know what you are looking for</h2><p>You want to hire an engineer, and you want to hire a great one. But the exact definition of "great" can depend on many factors, so a one-size-fits-all list of traits is unlikely to exist. </p><p>Are you a big company or a startup, what's the current state of the project and the team, are you hiring for a junior or a senior role? These are some of the obvious things to consider when thinking about the best fit for the role. Once you're clear on this you can work out the details and the exact qualities you're looking for in a candidate. Finally, all this will determine what you screen for and what your interview scorecards need to look like.</p><p>In a Lyft Engineering blog post <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/how-lyft-designs-the-machine-learning-software-engineering-interview-bbbb9fc8bb28">How Lyft Designs the Machine Learning Software Engineering Interview</a>, Hao Yi Ong states the following three questions to ask in order to understand what you actually want from a role you're hiring for:</p><blockquote>1. What are Lyft’s challenges (and can a specific role help)?<br>2. What should the role be with respect to the organization’s goals?<br>3. What are the desired skills, knowledge, and talents given the expectations for the role?</blockquote><p>Companies are more or less transparent about detailed requirements for the roles. The above-mentioned article briefly describes them as follows:</p><blockquote>Our desired talents are <em><em>recurring patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior that can be productively applied</em></em> in the context of Lyft’s ML SWE role. What we’re looking for here is a bit more complicated than simply work done in the past by a candidate. Faced with the same stimuli, people react and behave differently. When we look for role and values fit, we do mean just that. Beyond skills and knowledge, will a candidate’s unique way of responding to the problems thrown up in Lyft’s business context help that candidate succeed? So while conventional wisdom might suggest it, we’re not always looking for the Michael Jordans of machine learning (be it I. or J.). The narrow sort of talents associated with celebrated excellence can be important but in most cases the interviewers are listening for predictive clues of how a candidate will react when posed Lyft-specific problems on the job.</blockquote><p>Speaking about high level qualities of successful engineers, here's what Ted Tomlinson of Databricks shares in his article <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/22/engineering-intervews-a-hiring-managers-guide.html">Engineering Interviews — A Hiring Manager’s Guide to Standing Out</a>:</p><blockquote>At a startup like Databricks, the most important quality I’ve seen in successful engineers is ownership. We are growing quickly, which brings a lot of new challenges every week, but it’s not always clear how responsibilities divide across teams and priorities get determined. Great engineers handle this ambiguity by surfacing the most impactful problems to work on, not just those limited to their current team’s responsibilities. Sometimes this means directly helping to build the solution, but often it’s motivating others to prioritize the work.<p>The second quality we focus on, particularly for those earlier in their career, is the ability to learn and grow. The derivative of knowledge is often more important than a candidate’s current technical skills. Many of the engineering problems we are solving don’t have existing templates to follow. That means continually breaking through layers of abstraction to consider the larger system – from the lowest level of cpu instructions, up to how visualizations are rendered in the browser.</p></blockquote><p>Going back to tailoring the requirements to the needs of your company, notice that Ted points out that <em>ownership</em> is <em>the most important quality at a startup like Databricks, </em>suggesting that wouldn't necessarily be equally important at a different place.</p><p>Once you've figured out the qualities you're looking for, you can go deeper and break them down into fine-grained categories that you can actually screen for in an interview. Medium Engineering shares a great example of how this can be done. In <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-what-we-screen-for-af2d84122417">Engineering interviews: what we screen for</a>, Jamie Talbot explains how at Medium they're looking for three things: (1) Can they build software? (2) Can they learn and teach? (3) Are they aligned with our values?</p><p>Each of these high level requirements is then broken down into six sub-categories. For example <em>ability to build software </em>covers the following categories:</p><ul><li>Problem solving</li><li>Code fluency</li><li>Autonomy</li><li>Basic computer science knowledge</li><li>System design</li><li>Resoluteness</li></ul><p>If you're curious, each capability is described in detail in the <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-what-we-screen-for-af2d84122417">blog post</a>. In addition to that, the team at Medium devised a detailed grading guideline for each category, helping interviewers decide on the scale of <em>Strong No &gt; No &gt; Mixed &gt; Yes &gt; Strong Yes. </em>They describe it in another article <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f">here</a>.</p><p>With any problem, hiring being no exception, it helps to know why you're doing it and what your environment and constraints are. Only then you can come up with creative and more effective solutions.</p><p>Speaking of constraints, they're likely to change over time, rendering your existing interview process inefficient.</p><h2 id="be-ready-to-iterate">Be ready to iterate</h2><p>There's several reasons for being flexible and ready to adapt your technical interview process. </p><p>In the previous part we discussed how you need to tailor your interviews to fit your company, project and team needs. Inevitably, these things will change over time, and with that your interview process will likely need to change as well.</p><p>On that note, when reading through company blogs a recurring theme is <em>redesign</em> of the interview process. It usually happens because circumstances change, but often (as with any process) you can find room for improvement even when the environment hasn't changed much. </p><p>At Medium they noticed more than a few things they thought need improvement. As elaborated in <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-refining-our-process-52fbc9510e91">Engineering interviews: refining our process</a> they wanted to address lack of clarity in capability requirements, inconsistencies in candidate evaluation, which traits are considered important and which less so, how they approach personality traits and non-technical qualities.</p><p>At The New York Times, they recognized the need to standardize the hiring process across the company, as it's recognized to be the key determining factor for the culture. One of the things where a consolidated interview process helped is increased trust for internal mobility. Due to lack of trust among teams, it could happen that an engineer would be required to pass a technical interview if they were to change teams. You can read about this on the NYT Open, the official behind-the-scenes blog of The New York Times (namely these two articles: <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-designed-our-front-end-engineer-hiring-process-9b8f20cc31fb">How We Designed Our Front-End Engineer Hiring Process</a>, <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-hire-front-end-engineers-at-the-new-york-times-e1294ea8e3f8">How We Hire Front-End Engineers at The New York Times</a>).</p><p>In <a href="https://slack.engineering/refactoring-backend-engineering-hiring-at-slack/">Refactoring Backend Engineering Hiring at Slack</a>, Slack engineers share the story of why and how they optimized the take-home exercise. Although it had many points in its favor, the exercise was a bottleneck in their hiring process. Candidates, wanting to show off the best of their skills, would take too much time to complete the exercise. Slack, on the other hand, was in state of rapid growth and the projected time for staffing all the necessary positions simply was too long:</p><blockquote>The end result was that, by our estimates, it would have taken a year to fill our existing open headcount, future growth aside. This timeframe clearly would not allow us to grow at the speed we needed. However, we were also unwilling to sacrifice quality. We needed an approach that would give us good signal and help us hire great engineers, but at a reduced time cost to the candidate and to us. <p>To satisfy these needs, we decided to create two new take-home exercises: an API design exercise and a code review exercise. In creating these exercises, we sought to create a problem that was not an onerous time investment on the part of the candidate. We wanted something that would give us good signal on the attributes we cared about while taking at most two hours to complete.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, the team at Slack came up with a new format for the challenge as well as internal apps and GitHub automations to streamline the process, resulting in significant measurable improvement:</p><blockquote>In the end, we saw tangible improvements against our goals. We saw a decrease in our time-to-hire — the time from when a recruiter first reaches out, to the candidate’s first day in the office. The time-to-hire metric decreased from an average of 200 days to below 83 days — and it continues to drop. We’ve seen positive feedback from candidates and employees in all parts of the process.</blockquote><p>At Soundcloud, the team attacked the same part of the interview funnel - the take-home exercise, since they noticed it often takes far too long to complete it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The goal of this article is to convey an approach to solving data structure and
algorithm problems. My hope is that it helps you in a situation where you might
otherwise draw a blank.</p>
<p>I want to start by stating an obvious but important truth: your brain is
<strong>amazing</strong>. You are constantly and rapidly solving unimaginably complex
problems that make even the most challenging FAANG whiteboard interview look
like a stroll in the park. Steven Pinker expresses this idea eloquently in <em>How
The Mind Works</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…the gap between robots in imagination and in reality…shows the first
step we must take in knowing ourselves: appreciating the fantastically complex
design behind feats of mental life we take for granted. The reason there are
no humanlike robots is not that the very idea of a mechanical mind is
misguided. It is that the engineering problems that we humans solve as we see
and walk and plan and make it through the day are far more challenging than
landing on the moon or sequencing the human genome. Nature, once again, has
found ingenious solutions that human engineers cannot yet duplicate. When
Hamlet says, “What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite
in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable!” we should direct
our awe not at Shakespeare or Mozart or Einstein or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar but at
a four-year old carrying out a request to put a toy on a shelf.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pinker goes on to say that the “faculty with which we ponder the world has no
ability to peer inside itself or our other faculties to see what makes them
tick.” I beg to differ. In Pinker’s defense, he may be using hyperbole to
accentuate his point.</p>
<p>We are all students of the mind – simultaneously scientist and lab rat. When we
make consciousness the subject of consciousness, we can pull back the veil and
bear witness to the built-in algorithms that are otherwise taken for granted.</p>
<p>This process can be leveraged to help demystify data structure and algorithm
questions. Let’s walk through a specific problem to illustrate the concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implement strStr().</p>
<p>Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle
is not part of haystack.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty
string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/">https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/</a></p>
<p>First and foremost, you need example input. If it’s not provided by default,
either ask for it or define your own inputs.</p>
<p>In this case, Leetcode provides us with example input:</p>
<pre><code>Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
</code></pre><p><strong>Resist</strong> the temptation to write code.</p>
<p>This stage is not about coding, it’s about observing and deconstructing how your
mind arrives at a solution.</p>
<p>Can you determine, at a glance, whether or not “hello” contains “ll”? Of course
you can. It does. This conclusion seems to materialize instantaneously, doesn’t
it? It also seems to require little to no effort. Take a moment here to
appreciate just how effective your mind is at this task.</p>
<p>The operative question is: how? More specifically, how <strong>does</strong> your mind solve it?
The crux of this article is that you should focus on that question as opposed
to the categorically different question of: how <strong>should</strong> you solve this?</p>
<p>When I slow down and observe how my mind tackles this problem, I arrive at the
following deconstruction. It seems as if my mind identifies the length of the
needle, then iterates through the haystack, making needle-sized chunks as it
goes, comparing each chunk to the needle for equality.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, it looks something like this:</p>
<p>Does “he” equal “ll”? No.</p>
<p>Does “el” equal “ll”? No.</p>
<p>Does “ll” equal “ll”? Yes!</p>
<p>Now it’s just a matter of identifying the matching index, which is 2.</p>
<p>Simple enough, right?</p>
<p>We can probably dissect it further using three pointers but for the sake of
brevity I’ll sidestep the added complexity.</p>
<p>Now that we have a proposed explanation for how the mind solves this problem,
translating it into code is comparatively trivial.</p>
<p>Avoid premature optimization at this stage. Sometimes, the mind’s approach is
efficient; other times it is inefficient and you can improve on it. Either way,
defer optimization. First make it work, then make it better. An inefficient
solution is better than no solution.</p>
<p>Here is a pretty simple implementation of the process outlined above in Python.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Solution</span>:
    <span>def</span> <span>strStr</span>(self, haystack: str, needle: str) <span>-&gt;</span> int:
        haystack_length <span>=</span> len(haystack) <span>-</span> <span>1</span>
        needle_length <span>=</span> len(needle) <span>-</span> <span>1</span>
        i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

        <span>while</span> i <span>&lt;=</span> haystack_length <span>-</span> needle_length: 
            <span>if</span> haystack[i:i <span>+</span> needle_length <span>+</span> <span>1</span>] <span>==</span> needle:
                <span>return</span> i
            i <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
            
        <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In a nutshell, this implementation starts at the first element of haystack,
creates a needle-sized slice, and compares the slice to the needle for equality.
If equality is confirmed, it returns the index. If not, the index is iterated
and the slice and comparison is repeated starting from the next element. This
process continues until an equality check succeeds or the index reaches
<code>haystack_length - needle_length</code>, since any slice past that point will not be
long enough to match the needle in size.</p>
<p>The time and space complexity are both O(n).</p>
<p>I hope you found this helpful. Remember: your brain is amazing. If you can solve
a problem without code, you already know the solution, it’s just a matter of
unboxing it.</p>

		<p>A closer look at the glyphs drawn by the DEC terminals VT100 and VT220.</p>
		<p><span>R</span>ecently, I engaged in a bit of analog media emulation, namely for the purpose of the reenactment of raster CRT graphics as seen on “glass terminals” like the iconic VT-series by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). An endeavor, which raises a few questions, like, is there anything special to the media, what did the fonts really look like, and can we reconstruct them from specifications? </p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-crt-typography.png" alt="VT100 Series CRT Typography" width="800" height="800">
			<figcaption><em>(Not a DEC manual.)</em></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Thanks to a tiny wealth of technical information available on the web, at sites like <a href="https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vt100.net</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/terminal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitsavers.org</a>, determining the look of these fonts should be easy. E.g., we may reconstruct the glyphs from the terminals’ ROMs. This way, we should be able to determine their exact forms. There are even TrueType-fonts available, meant to recreate the typography of the VT220, “<a href="http://sensi.org/~svo/glasstty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glass TTY VT220</a>,” including scanlines, and “<a href="https://www.dafont.com/dec-terminal-modern.font" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEC Terminal Modern</a>” with modernized, smooth outlines:</p>


		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-vt220-ttf.png" alt="VT220 TrueType fonts" width="710" height="415">
			<figcaption>Modern TrueType fonts recreating the glyphs of the VT220.<br>Mind that the VT-terminals supported two resolution modes, one at 132 characters per line and one at 80 characters (char-matrix 9×10 and 10×10, respectively), the latter introducing an extra spacing of one pixel.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Having a closer look at the two fonts, there are some notable differences (the differences in spacing may be explained by the two characters per line modes of the VT-terminals), however, neither looks right. Comparing them to photos of the similar VT100, there are discernible differences, not only in the font weight, but also in the size and form of the conters and the overal “feel” of the font. However, the apparent confusion about the weight of the font isn’t especially helped by photos of the real thing either, as the impression conveyed by them differs widely by lens, exposure and camera settings used:</p>

		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>Since photos aren’t much of a help here either, it may be time for a look at the…</p>

		<h2>ROMs</h2>

		<p>Since ROMs are available, we may start there, since they are the closest, we may get, to the real thing, aren’t they? What could possibly go wrong?</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-roms.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 separated characters as in ROM" width="558" height="410">
			<figcaption><p>Separated ROM readings of the VT100 (left) and the VT220 (right).<br><cite>VT220 separation by Paul Flo Williams, <a href="https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vt100.net</a> (2008). VT100 complemented by me, N.L.</cite></p>
			<p>Character definitions differ for “a”, “c”, “g”, “2”, “6”, “7”, “9”, “@”, “%”, “{”, “}”, “|”, “°” and in the forms of the control characters (␉ ␍ ␊ ␤ ␋). Moreover, there are additional characters on the VT220.</p></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Now, this doesn’t look right either. Obviously, the glyphs will be rendered stretched vertically to about double height, but there’s more going on here. The characters just don’t look right. P.e., have a closer look at “p” and “q” or the offset in the dots of the downward right stroke of “k”, not to speak of the funny digits “6” and “9” of the VT100 or the distorted “2”! Moreover, at a closer look, the character matrix is just 8×10, while we expected at least 9×10 (and 10×10 for 80-cols mode) — as described in the specifications. Clearly, this is not what is displayed on the screen.</p>

		<h2>Phosphor</h2>
		<p>Let’s have another look at the manuals, specifically at the “<a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-tm/ek-vt100-tm-002.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VT100 Series Technical Manual</a>” <cite>(2<sup>nd</sup> edition, EK-VT100-TM-002; DEC, Maynard, Massachsetts, Aug. 1979)</cite>. As we learn there, it’s all about phosphor latency:</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-phosphor-flanks.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 phosphor latency" width="743" height="390">
			<figcaption><p>Pulse widths and phosphor activation flanks for the VT100 and VT200.<br><cite>(VT100 Series Technical Manual, EK-VT100-TM-002, p. 4-78)</cite></p>
			<p>Mind that the flanks of the signal pulses are highly idealized and will be also sloped in analog real life.</p></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>The time it takes for the phosphor to become fully activated is actually longer than the pulse representing the timing to draw a single pixel (40 nanoseconds). Meaning, if we were to attempt to display just a single pixel, the phosphor on this particular spot will never reach its full activation level resulting in a fuzzy image of varying brightnesses between dimmer, thin strokes and heavier, thick strokes. So the typography has to adjust for this, by streching the pulses to double width (80 ns), at least, in order to provide an even image and legible text and to work around the shallow flanks of the screen intensification.</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-monitor-repsonse.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 monitor response" width="800" height="250">
			<figcaption>Single and double pixel-widths, pulse timing and phosphor activation.<br><cite>(As above, re-edited N.L.)</cite></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h2>Dot Stretching Circuitry</h2>
		<p>To provide for this, the VT-terminals employ a special technique, called <em>dot stretching:</em> The individual rows of a character matrix as in ROM are modified on-the-fly by prolonging any pulses for an active pixel for yet another pixel. Where there’s a single pixel in ROM, there will be two on the screen, where there are two in a row, there will be three displayed. (This is equivalent to OR-ing a word with itself by an offset of one pixel or bit to the right.)</p>
		<p>By this, our 8×10 matrix extends to the expected 9×10 (or 10×10 for the 80-columns mode, where the last pixel, which is set only for the line-drawing characters, will be stretched for yet another pulse.)</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-dot-stretching.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 dot streching" width="830" height="376">
			<figcaption>Dot streching on the VT100 and VT200.<br><cite>(VT100 Series Technical Manual, EK-VT100-TM-002, p. 4-78)</cite></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>However, this will provide different results for normal character size and double-width characters! Thanks to the wonders of dot stretching, there are two distinct fonts in one, each of them specially suited for the display size by the amount of detail exhibited!</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-dot-stretching-flanked.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 dot streching" width="410" height="410">
			<figcaption><p>1) as in ROM<br>
			2) single width with dot stretching<br>
			3) double width with dot stretching<br>
			4) single width with dot stretching and latency (flanks)<br>
			5) double width with dot stretching and latency (flanks)</p>
			<p><cite>(1, 2 &amp; 3 by Paul Flo Williams, <a href="https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vt100.net</a>, 4 &amp; 5 added by me, N.L.)</cite></p></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>It’s crucially the image given in (2), representing dot streching, which provides the blocky, rather bold strokes found in modern representation of the font. However, if we add the sine- and cosine-like ramps of the flanks of the rising and dropping phosphor activation (compare 4 &amp; 5 and the timing diagram above), we arrive at a closer rendition of the screen image (mind that the VT100 and VT220 are said to expose quite discernible scanlines).</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-character-rendering.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 screen rendering" width="300" height="182">
			<figcaption><p>VT220 character samples (80-columns mode).<br>1) as in ROM<br>

			<p>Mind, how the conters “open up” in 4 and 5.</p>
			<p><cite>(1 &amp; 2 by Paul Flo Williams, <a href="https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vt100.net</a>, 3 &amp; 4 and negative image added by me, N.L.)</cite></p></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>As we may say, a rather extreme example of the media instructing typographical forms, or, <em>vice versa,</em> the glyph design working by the media and its specific technological constraints to arrive at the desired typography. Having a look at the effects of phosphor activation, latency and bleed, we may also understand, why individual photos of VT-terminal screens show varying font weights, according to the exposure in respect to the brightness of the monitor, while an overall smoothness of the font is still preserved.</p>
		
		<p>And here is another representation of the ROM-separations (compare the image above) with effects applied, providing a closer impression of the screen rendition:</p>

		</figure>

		<h2>Workbench Images</h2>

		<p>And here are, finally, two images <em>”from the workbench”,</em> showing my own attempts to recreate the screen experience in a web browser (HTML5, canvas API). Yea, there may be a bit too much retro-blur, however, you get the idea:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>And that’s all for this episode…</p>

						<p>Researchers at Harvard University have developed a new tool to help measure behaviors in animal movement.</p><p>The team ran their studies by combining their tool, CAPTURE, with neural recordings to describe the relationship between brain activity and behavior. They are also working with Google DeepMind to use CAPTURE to model animal behavior using deep neural networks.</p><p>"We had developed really elaborate approaches to study how the brain is disrupted in parkinsonian mice, but our ability to measure their behavioral deficits was a far cry from the nuanced ways we can assess the impact of Parkinson's on human behavior," said co-author Jesse D. Marshall. "It became clear to me that a major reason why so many drugs tested in mice don't translate to humans is that our ability to measure their effects on behavior is quite limited."</p><p>Marshall's obsession with the idea of CAPTURE started as a student working on Parkinson's Disease models in mice.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A story about RFC 6238</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>DISCLAIMER:</em> I hate to keep mentioning it, but please don't abuse this knowledge. There are enough malicious actors out there already. This article was written to try and help our  defenders of the realm to be more effective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Security models always seem to be great until they are not. The curious part is how many people seem to beg the question more often than not. It's easy to just blindly accept something as true without challenging it (such as the safety of a given model). As a community, we should support challenging perceptions and sharing knowledge with others.</p>

<p>At DefCon 26 I was drinking with some friends, discussing hashing and encryption, when the topic of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">RFC 6238</a> came up. This RFC defines an open standard for Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) to be used as a factor in authentication schemes. For the unfamiliar, it's pretty popular and widely supported. Many common multi-factor authentication mechanisms rely on implementing this spec (for example Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile, Authy, pyotp for python, and others.) But all of these services are only secure if the secret is confidential. Some people were convinced the TOTP implementations are flawed, and others were not. So can we break this security model by generating the same TOTP codes as a particular target?</p>

<p>After a bit of research and testing, I submitted attack mode <code>18100</code> to Hashcat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE:</em> I think the process for submitting any PR to the Hashcat project is fascinating. Mine have been worthwhile exercises in good coding practices and collaborative development. I would recommend others contribute to this project for the experience as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How does this work?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE:</em> I think the theories behind attacks are important, but if you don't care for the details just skip ahead to "Simulating an attack" in the next section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RFC itself is fairly straight forward. It builds on a previous RFC for OTP, but uses a timestamp to create a derived counter.</p>

<p>We start with our secret. It's just a base32 encoded value. This really could be anything, but it seems that most implementations have standardized on defaulting to encoding a random 10 byte value. (This leaves us with 16 bytes of encoded text.)</p>

<p>We then take the HMAC of our counter, using our encoded secret as the key. Let's call the product of this <em><code>H</code></em>.</p>

<p>An offset is next calculated from the end bits of <em><code>H</code></em>, and we extract four bytes of the hash from that offset and convert them to an unsigned integer. Using our integer, we take the modulo of 10^<em><code>length</code></em> (where <em><code>length</code></em> is the number of digits you want in your resulting code; up to 10), and we now have our TOTP code.</p>

<p>Now, if we can reliably determine which secret generates the OTP code in question at a particular point in time we will have a practical attack. This means that we need at least two pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>A TOTP code</li>
<li>The rough timestamp at which this code was generated</li>
</ul>

<p>The caveat here is that the reduction on the HMAC hash results in a large number of collisions for a single point in time. Between two points in time, the collisions seem to be unique, but we should have a duplicate for the real secret which created our codes.</p>

<h2>Simulating an attack</h2>

<p>Let's now see if we can simulate an attack within a controlled keyspace. In order to keep our OpenCL kernels fast, the base32 encoding of our secret is only performed by the CPU once a candidate has been matched. This means that all of the candidates we try will be raw, but the output of a match will be base32 encoded.</p>

<p><strong>Don't try to attack the base32 value directly. This won't work!</strong></p>

<p>For this test, we will take our raw secret (<code>hashcat</code>) and base32 encode it to produce <code>NBQXG2DDMF2A====</code>. This represents our target secret which we hope to recover. In the wild, it would be sitting on some remote resource responsible for authentication, and unknown to us.</p>

<p>Next, we need two TOTP codes derived from this secret. It's a lot easier than it seems to obtain these codes. They do not need to be consecutive, we just need two of them. Something as simple as a photo (or video) of someone's TOTP client would be sufficient (a picture has the code which was produced, and the EXIF data should provide you with a timestamp.)</p>

<p>For this experiment, since this is just a test lab, we will use python's <code>pyotp</code> package to produce our two TOTP codes. We are going to use two random timestamps to generate these codes, using the <code>pyotp.TOTP.at()</code> method. (The timestamps can be any values, as long as they are different.)</p>

<pre><code>$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Aug 17 2018, 17:41:52)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.0.42)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyotp
&gt;&gt;&gt; totp = pyotp.TOTP("NBQXG2DDMF2A====")
&gt;&gt;&gt; totp.at(1263384780)
u'833060'
&gt;&gt;&gt; totp.at(1528848780)
u'549115'
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have our tokens and our timestamps, we need to place them in a file using the format <code>$TOKEN:$TIMESTAMP</code>. Let's call the file <code>test.hash</code> for this simulation.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat test.hash
833060:1263384780
549115:1528848780
</code></pre>

<p>The attack itself will be done in two parts:
* First, we run Hashcat against the test codes to produce all of the secret candidates in our keyspace. To keep this simulation manageable, we will only use the topology <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code>.
* Second, we will check our candidates for duplicates to find our genuine secret.</p>

<h3>The attack</h3>

<p>This particular hash mode is not like your average modes in Hashcat. By default its definition tells Hashcat to keep guessing candidates until the available keyspace is exhausted. As a result, Hashcat's "recovered" stat will always remain 0 despite your pot file filling up. This is expected, so don't worry!</p>

<p>Let's see an example in action...</p>

<pre><code>./hashcat -m17300 -a3 -o totp.potfile test.hash ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l

</code></pre>

<h3>Post-hashcat cleanup</h3>

<p>Once the attack is finished, you should have a pool of candidates in your pot file. Most of them should be unique, but your genuine secret will be duplicated across two entries. We just need a tiny bit of shell work to reveal which one that was. The following snippet should do this for you.</p>

<pre><code>$ cut -d: -f3 totp.potfile | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
  2 NBQXG2DDMF2A====
  1 PJZXS23RPFYA====
  1 PJZXO5TDNZTA====
  1 PJZXM5DMOBTQ====
  1 PJZXM2LTMV2A====
  1 PJZXI5DWNZWA====
  1 PJZXG2DUNZTQ====
  1 PJZXA4LQOBUQ====
  1 PJZXA4LPN55A====
  1 PJZWYYTBONYA====
</code></pre>

<p>Huzzah! Our duplicated secret appears on top!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE:</em> If you see more than one entry with a count higher than 1, something went wrong. You should re-evaluate your steps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we can take this secret and plug it back into pyotp (or your client of choice) to generate valid tokens!</p>

<h2>Practical exploitation</h2>

<p>In the wild, this is a bit more nuanced. We aren't usually going to know much about the target secret (like its topology), so we may need to search through a larger keyspace. This could take quite some time. Of course, the more GPUs you have, the faster this will go.</p>

<p>This also assumes that your TOTP implementation is using a few defaults: 30 second steps, HMAC-SHA1 hashing, and 10-byte secrets. You may be surprised at how many implementations use the defaults, or worse yet make the defaults immutable (I'm looking at you Google Authenticator!)</p>

<p>For clarity, the RFC technically defines a secret length at 16 bytes minimum, but many implementations are calculating this from the base32 encoded secret. This means, our 16 byte secret is really a 10 byte secret when decoded. Again, it doesn't <em>have</em> to be this way. But even if the secret is 10 bytes, this attack may not be practical for most (though it isn't out of the realm of possibilities for some actors.) A truly random 10 byte keyspace is incredibly large (although "true randomness" deserves its own discussion.) Any insight you can gain to help reduce the keyspace is definitely going to help here.</p>

<p>If you are responsible for maintaining a TOTP system, I would recommend setting a stronger algorithm (use HMAC-SHA512 if possible) and longer secrets (24+ bytes should last a while into the future.)</p>

<p>Never take your world for granted. Test everything. Hack the planet.</p>

December 23, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/21/using-directive/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/21/using-directive/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Recall that in C++ there’s a difference between a <em>using-declaration</em>
and a <em>using-directive</em>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>using std::string;  // using-declaration
using namespace std;  // using-directive
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="using-declarations">Using-declarations</h2>

<p>A using-declaration is semantically similar to a declaration;
it introduces into the current scope a new meaning for a name. If that
name already had one or more meanings from outer scopes, those existing
meanings are <em>hidden</em>, or <em>shadowed</em>, by the new declaration.
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Khx1cb">Godbolt:</a></p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace AnimalUtils {
    int foo(Zoo::Animal);
}
namespace Outer {
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
    namespace Inner {
        int foo(Zoo::Cat);  // declaration hides Outer::foo
        int test1() {
            return foo(Zoo::Lion());
        }
        int test2() {
            using AnimalUtils::foo;  // using-declaration hides Inner::foo
            return foo(Zoo::Lion()); // calls AnimalUtils::foo
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The declaration of <code>foo</code> in <code>Inner</code> <em>hides</em>, or <em>shadows</em>, the previous meaning that <code>foo</code> had had;
so when we look up the name <code>foo</code> inside <code>test1</code>, we find only <code>Inner::foo</code>.
We don’t even consider <code>Outer::foo</code> as a candidate.</p>

<p>The using-declaration of <code>foo</code> in <code>test2</code> <em>hides</em>, or <em>shadows</em>, the previous meaning that <code>foo</code>
had had; so when we look up the name <code>foo</code> inside <code>test2</code>, we find only <code>AnimalUtils::foo</code>.
We don’t even consider <code>Inner::foo</code> as a candidate.</p>

<p>(So how does <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/07/11/the-std-swap-two-step/">the <code>std::swap</code> two-step</a> work?
Well, besides the normal unqualified lookup, we also do a <em>separate</em> argument-dependent lookup,
and merge the two candidate sets. So in this particular case, overload resolution would also
consider any meanings of <code>foo</code> declared in namespace <code>Zoo</code>. But there is no such <code>foo</code> in
this example.)</p>

<h2 id="using-directives">Using-directives</h2>

<p>Using-directives are subtler than using-declarations. But the good news is that
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">you should never use them!</a>
Seriously, don’t ever write <code>using namespace Whatever</code>; and then you won’t have
any trouble with them. Just pretend they don’t exist.</p>

<p><b>But</b>, let’s talk about them anyway.</p>

<p>Using-directives also introduce new meanings for names into scopes. But the surprising
thing is that they don’t introduce those meanings into the <em>current</em> scope! A using-directive
introduces its new meanings into the scope which is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor">lowest common ancestor</a>
of the current scope and the target namespace’s own scope.</p>

<p>In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the “lowest common ancestor” of two nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
can be found by tracing a path from <em>A</em> up to the root, and tracing a path from <em>B</em> up to
the root — the lowest common ancestor is the place where the two paths first meet up.</p>

<p>Alternatively, start tracing a “fully qualified path” downward from the root; the
lowest common ancestor corresponds to the longest common prefix of these fully qualified
names. For example, consider this hierarchy of namespaces:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace NA { }
namespace NB {
    namespace NC {
        namespace N1 { }
        namespace N2 { }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lowest common ancestor of <code>NB::NC::N1</code> and <code>NB::NC::N2</code> is <code>NB::NC</code>.
The lowest common ancestor of <code>NA</code> and <code>NB::NC::N2</code> is the root (the global namespace).</p>

<p>So, consider this snippet of C++ code (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/h41d9T">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace NA {
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
}
namespace NB {
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
    namespace NC {
        namespace N1 {
            int foo(Zoo::Cat);
        }
        namespace N2 {
            int test() {
                using namespace N1;
                using namespace NA;
                return foo(Zoo::Lion());
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might reasonably expect that when <code>test</code> passes a <code>Lion</code> to <code>foo</code>,
it would result in a call to <code>NA::foo(Lion)</code>, because we “using-directive’d”
<code>namespace NA</code>. Or at least it might call <code>NB::foo(Lion)</code>, since that’s
what would happen in the absence of any using-directives at all.
But in fact it calls <code>N1::foo(Cat)</code>!</p>

<p>As shown in the diagram below: <code>using namespace N1</code> causes a declaration of
<code>N1::foo(Cat)</code> to be injected into the least common ancestor of <code>N1</code> and <code>N2</code>,
which is <code>NC</code>. This declaration of the name <code>foo</code> <em>hides</em> any and all meanings
of <code>foo</code> introduced in higher-up scopes, such as <code>NB::foo(Lion)</code>.</p>

<p><code>using namespace NA</code> causes a declaration of <code>NA::foo(Lion)</code> to be injected
into the least common ancestor of <code>NA</code> and <code>N2</code>, which is the global namespace.
This injected declaration ends up being hidden by the declaration of <code>NB::foo(Lion)</code>,
which is in turn hidden by the declaration of <code>N1::foo(Cat)</code> which has been
injected into namespace <code>NC</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/images/2020-12-21-using-directive.png" alt="Diagram of what happens in that example"></p>

<p>By the way, even though the declaration of <code>N1::foo</code> has been injected into <code>NC</code>,
you can’t actually refer to it as <code>NC::foo</code>. It has been injected only for the purposes
of <em>unqualified</em> lookups — and only for the purposes of unqualified lookups that happen
within this scope. Nobody outside of the scope of <code>test</code> is going to “see” that
declaration of <code>foo</code> injected into namespace <code>NC</code>.</p>

<h3 id="a-stdswap-mis-step">A <code>std::swap</code> mis-step</h3>

<p>Consider the following bad code (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6aPT71">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace detail {
    struct Impl {};
    void swap(Impl&amp;, Impl&amp;);

    template&lt;class T&gt;
    void example(T&amp; x, T&amp; y) {
        using namespace std;
        swap(x, y);
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s bad for three reasons. Number one, it fails to use the hidden friend idiom
for <code>swap(Impl&amp;, Impl&amp;)</code>. Number two, it uses <code>using namespace std</code>. (Both of these are
red flags that should insta-fail any code review you do.)
Number three, its use of <code>using namespace</code> is wrong in terms of the “<code>std::swap</code> two-step.”
(See <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/07/11/the-std-swap-two-step/">“What is the <code>std::swap</code> two-step?”</a> (2020-07-11).)
In the two-step, we <em>want</em> to bring the meaning of <code>swap</code> from namespace <code>std</code> into our current scope,
so that <code>swap(x, y)</code> will consider that meaning in addition to any meaning assigned
by ADL. But what we’re doing here, instead, is to bring the meaning of <code>swap</code> (and every
other name in <code>std</code>) from namespace <code>std</code> into <em>the least common ancestor namespace</em> of
<code>std</code> and <code>detail</code>; i.e., into the global namespace.</p>

<p>So when we try to instantiate <code>example&lt;int&gt;</code>, unqualified lookup looks for declarations of
<code>swap</code> in our current scope working outward, and it finds <code>detail::swap(Impl&amp;, Impl&amp;)</code> and stops
there. It never finds the templated <code>std::swap</code> declared in the global namespace. Oops!
That’s why the <em>correct</em> version of the <code>std::swap</code> two-step uses a using-declaration and
not a using-directive.</p>

<h2 id="using-directives-in-namespace-scope">Using-directives in namespace scope</h2>

<p>You can also put a <em>using-directive</em> at namespace scope, like this
(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/9EdMMo">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace ND::N3 {
    int foo(Zoo::Cat);
}

namespace NE {
    using namespace ND::N3;
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
}

namespace ND {
    namespace N4 {
        int test3() {
            using namespace NE;
            return foo(Zoo::Lion());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using-directives are “transitive”; since <code>NE</code> visibly contains a using-directive
for <code>ND</code>, it’s as if <code>test3</code> contains <em>both</em> <code>using namespace NE</code> <em>and</em> <code>using namespace ND::N3</code>.</p>

<p>In this contrived example, the names from <code>NE</code> are injected into the least common ancestor
of <code>ND::N4</code> and <code>NE</code> (i.e., the global namespace). The names from <code>ND::N3</code> are injected into the
least common ancestor of <code>ND::N4</code> and <code>ND::N3</code> (i.e., <code>ND</code>). Then, unqualified
lookup for <code>foo</code> scans outward from <code>ND::N4::test3</code>, stopping as soon as it finds the declaration of
<code>ND::N3::foo(Cat)</code> that has been injected into namespace <code>ND</code>. That declaration <em>hides</em>
the ostensibly better-matching <code>NE::foo(Lion)</code> that was injected into the global namespace.</p>

<p>Note that the “transitivity” of using-directives applies only to using-directives that are <em>directly</em>
within the using’ed namespace. If <code>test3</code> had said <code>using namespace NE::N5</code>, it would have
transitively picked up the using-directives from <code>NE::N5</code>, but not from its parent namespace <code>NE</code>
(and not from the global namespace).</p>

<p>And how does all this interact with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace#Inline_namespaces"><code>inline namespace</code></a>?
Well, let’s save that for another day.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some of these examples probably surprised you. I hope the explanations made sense anyway, in retrospect.
But is any of this information <em>useful</em> to a good C++ programmer? I would have to say <b>no it is not.</b>
Good C++ programmers don’t use using-directives — and I hope this blog post has convinced you
to join them!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t use <code>using namespace</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for <em>why</em> using-directives work in this bizarrely unintuitive way, I’ve asked that
question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65365681/why-does-cs-using-namespace-work-the-way-it-does">over on Stack Overflow</a>.
So if you’ve got a good answer, that’s a great place to type it up!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>I have been talking with developers about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) recently and one question keeps coming up: “How do I revoke a JWT?”</p>

<p>If you poke around online, you’ll find that the most common answers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the duration of the JWT to a short period (a few minutes or seconds)</li>
  <li>Implement complicated blacklisting techniques</li>
  <li>Store every JWT so you can validate them</li>
</ul>

<p>There is not a simple solution because JWTs are designed to be portable, decoupled identities. Once you authenticate against an identity provider (IdP) and get back a JWT, you don’t need to ask the IdP if the JWT is valid. This is particularly powerful when you use RSA public/private key signing. The IdP signs the JWT using the private key and then any service that has the public key can verify the integrity of the JWT.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates this architecture:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/jwt-revoke_350.png" alt="Revoking JWTs"></p>

<p>The Todo Backend in the diagram can use the JWT and the public key to verify the JWT and then pull the user’s id (in this case the subject) out of the JWT. The Todo Backend can then use the user’s id to perform operations on that user’s data. However, because the Todo Backend isn’t verifying the JWT with the IdP, it has no idea if an administrator has logged into the IdP and locked or deleted that user’s account.</p>

<h2 id="reduce-the-duration-of-the-jwt">Reduce the duration of the JWT</h2>

<p>The most common solution is to reduce the duration of the JWT and revoke the refresh token so that the user can’t generate a new JWT. With this setup, the JWT’s expiration duration is set to something short (5-10 minutes) and the refresh token is set to something long (2 weeks or 2 months). At any time, an administrator can revoke the refresh token which means that the user must re-authenticate to get a new JWT. That is unless they happen to have a valid JWT.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get tricky. That user basically has 5 to 10 minutes to use the JWT before it expires. Once it expires, they’ll use their current refresh token to try and get a new JWT. Since the refresh token has been revoked, this operation will fail and they’ll be forced to login again.</p>

<p>It’s this 5 to 10 minute window that freaks everyone out. So, how do we fix it?</p>

<h2 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h2>

<p>One way is leveraging a distributed event system that notifies services when refresh tokens have been revoked. The IdP broadcasts an event when a refresh token is revoked and other backends/services listen for the event. When an event is received the backends/services update a local cache that maintains a set of users whose refresh tokens have been revoked. This cache is checked whenever a JWT is verified to determine if the JWT should be revoked or not. This is all based on the duration of JWTs and expiration instant of individual JWTs.</p>

<h3 id="example-revoking-jwts-in-fusionauth">Example: Revoking JWTs in FusionAuth</h3>

<p>To illustrate this, I’m going to use <a href="https://fusionauth.io/">FusionAuth</a>’s event and Webhook system as well as the <em>jwt.refresh-token.revoke</em> event. If you are building your own IdP or using another system, you might need to build out your own eventing system based on this article.</p>

<p>The FusionAuth <strong>jwt.refresh-token.revoke</strong> event looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"jwt.refresh-token.revoke"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"applicationTimeToLiveInSeconds"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"cc0567da-68a1-45f3-b15b-5a6228bb7146"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>600</span><span>
    </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>"userId"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, let’s write a simple Webhook in our application that will receive this event and update the JWTManager. (NOTE: our example has a variable called <code>applicationId</code> that is a global variable that stores the id of the application itself - in this case it would be&nbsp;<strong>cc0567da-68a1-45f3-b15b-5a6228bb7146</strong>). Our code below is written in Node.js and uses the <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-node-client">FusionAuth Node client library</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* Handle FusionAuth event. */</span>
<span>router</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/fusionauth-webhook</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revoke</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>userId</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>applicationTimeToLiveInSeconds</span><span>[</span><span>applicationId</span><span>]);</span>
  <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>sendStatus</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is how the JWTManager maintains the list of user ids whose JWTs should be revoked. Our implementation also starts a thread to clean up after itself so we don’t run out of memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>JWTManager</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>revokedJWTs</span><span>:</span> <span>{},</span>

  <span>/**
   * Checks if a JWT is valid. This assumes that the JWT contains a property named &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; that is a
   * NumericDate value defined in the JWT specification and a property named &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; that is the user id the
   * JWT belongs to.
   *
   * @param {object} jwt The JWT object.
   * @returns {boolean} True if the JWT is valid, false if it isn't.
   */</span>
  <span>isValid</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>jwt</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>=</span> <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>];</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>||</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>===</span> <span>null</span> <span>||</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>
  <span>},</span>

  <span>/**
   * Revokes all JWTs for the user with the given id using the duration (in seconds).
   *
   * @param {string} userId The user id (usually a UUID as a string).
   * @param {Number} durationSeconds The duration of all JWTs in seconds.
   */</span>
  <span>revoke</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>userId</span><span>,</span> <span>durationSeconds</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>userId</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>durationSeconds</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>);</span>
  <span>},</span>

  <span>/**
   * Cleans up the cache to remove old user's that have expired.
   * @private
   */</span>
  <span>_cleanUp</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>
    <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>(</span><span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>item</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>,</span> <span>_array</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>const</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>=</span> <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>item</span><span>];</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>expiration</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>now</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>delete</span> <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>item</span><span>];</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>/**
 * Set an interval to clean-up the cache.
 */</span>
<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>_cleanUp</span><span>,</span> <span>7000</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our backend also needs to ensure that it checks JWTs with the JWTManager on each API call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/todo</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>jwt</span> <span>=</span> <span>_parseJWT</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>);</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>isValid</span><span>(</span><span>jwt</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>sendStatus</span><span>(</span><span>401</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And finally we configure our Webhook in FusionAuth:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/webhooks-2019.jpg" alt="Set up a webhook in FusionAuth"></p>

<p>We can now revoke a user’s refresh token and FusionAuth will broadcast the event to our Webhook. The Webhook then updates the JWTManager which will cause JWTs for that user to be revoked.</p>

<p>This solution works well even in large systems with numerous backends. It requires the use of&nbsp;refresh tokens and an API that allows refresh tokens to be revoked. The only caveat is to be sure that your JWTManager code cleans up after itself to avoid&nbsp;running out memory.</p>

<p>If you are using FusionAuth, you can use the Webhook and Event system to build this feature into your application quickly. We are also writing JWTManager implementations into each of our client libraries so you don’t have to write those yourself. At the time of this writing, the Java and Node clients both have a JWTManager you can use. The other languages might have a JWTManager implementation now but if they don’t, just submit a support ticket or a Github issue and we will write one for you.</p>

                    <p>Bug Bounty hunting is one of the most lucrative side hustles for the vast majority of hackers and security researchers out there. &nbsp;Security breaches like the SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack always remind us that it doesn't need much effort for attackers to find a weak point in systems and leverage that to gain persistence in networks – while it's not likely that's the way the attackers got in, but we had reported how <a href="https://savebreach.com/solarwinds-exposed-ftp-credentials-back-in-2018-says-security-researcher-vinoth/">SolarWinds had exposed a critical FTP credential through a GitHub commit since 2018</a>, only brought to their notice in late 2019. A brilliant way to prevent such breaches is to crowdsource talent, security is very hard to get right but when you have a thousand different eyes looking into it, it's very probable that they will find issues and edge cases you never thought in the development cycle of your applications – and that's where a Bug Bounty Program fills the gap.</p><p>A large number of WhiteHats now just rely on bug bounties as their only source of income, and it all begins to makes sense – when you see Hackers making millions through their art of hacking. Full time (independent) hacking is becoming a thing, as we have entered the age of bug bounties. Bug Bounties are no longer a disorganized sector, but with more platforms it has almost become a mainstream profession.</p><p>Almost a year back, <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> had announced that Cosmin (<a href="https://hackerone.com/inhibitor181">@inhibitor181</a>) had reached $1 Million dollars in bug bounty earnings across their platform, and officially become the 7th Bug Bounty millionaire on the platform. Today, they tweeted that <a href="https://twitter.com/inhibitor181">@inhibitor181</a> has completed $2 Million dollars in bug bounty earnings which makes it an important landmark for the Bug Bounty industry, and the highest till date. Is it a vantage point or, will there be someone who will cross this?</p><h3 id="-1-million-dollars-in-bug-bounties-in-less-than-an-year">$1 Million Dollars in bug bounties in less than an year</h3><p><a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/congratulations-cosmin-worlds-seventh-million-dollar-bug-bounty-hacker">had earlier announced less than an year back</a> that Cosmin became the 7th hacker to have become a bug bounty millionaire. Now, he has crossed the $2M mark in all-time earnings, which means <a href="https://hackerone.com/inhibitor181">@inhibitor181</a> might have made $1M in bounties less than an year, on Hackerone itself.</p><h4 id="a-million-dollar-salary-with-just-about-4-years-of-work-experience">A Million dollar salary with just about 4 years of work experience</h4><p>At the age of 30, and with just 4 years of experience in bug bounty hunting, Cosmin makes $1 million in bug bounties a year from <a href="https://hackerone.com/inhibitor181">468<br>bugs that he reported on Hackerone</a>, and has made $2 million so far in bug bounties.</p><p>This is way higher than the pay of most senior position tech jobs or, cybersecurity/infosec jobs that we know.

<p>In his latest interview, engineer, analyst, and vehicle teardown wizard Sandy Munro discusses the future of the automotive industry and the role of Tesla in detail. Munro opened up about which companies he thinks can rival <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla</a> in the future and why most of them are still on the wrong path towards their ultimate doom. </p>



<p>I am going to jot down the major points he made on the show, you can directly jump to the video below by <a href="#video">clicking here</a>.</p>



<h2>Elon Musk lies a lot</h2>



<p>According to Sandy Munro, the CEO of one of the largest S&amp;P 500 companies, Mr. Elon Musk “lies a lot” — he is actually saying that Musk has developed a habit of understating and over-delivering. </p>



<p>Elon Musk does not fully disclose his next move, he just gives a hint and hides the most important stuff, just like the genius he is.</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/battery-day/">Tesla Battery Day</a> was hyped for a long time but no one exactly knew what the new <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/25/tesla-4680-cell-analyzed-sandy-munro/">4680 cells</a> looked like or even what the form factor or dimensions were, Chemistry is still a mystery. <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#presentation">The presentation</a> showing a 56% cost reduction in batteries was also unprecedented.</p>



<p>Sandy Munro says the new Tesla 2170 battery cells have almost eliminated cobalt and added more nickel, that’s the reason Musk was looking for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-nickel-idUSKCN24O0RV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nickel mines</a> a while ago.</p>



<p>Comparing Musk to the rest of the auto industry executives, he said the general public knows almost none of them, the only exception would be Volkswagen Chairman Herbert Diess. The reason behind this hiding is that they’re fearful of not being able to hit the bar which is set so high by <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://evannex.com/?ref=Iqtidar_TeslaOracle_EVANNEX_Banner" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzI1MCcgd2lkdGg9JzMwMCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></a><figcaption>– Sponsored –</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>QuantumScape, solid-state batteries, and Volkswagen</h2>



<p>Munro thinks if there would be any rival of Tesla’s 4680 lithium-ion battery in the next two years, it would be QuantumScape’s solid-state lithium-metal batteries. According to his knowledge, since Volkswagen has a big share in Bill Gates-backed QuantumScape, VW will be the only company rivaling Tesla in the EV marketplace in the near-term future.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/sandy-munro/">Sandy Munro</a> is of the view that still it would take a lot of finessing to do with the solid-state batteries, “it will not be an easy trick,” he says.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Anybody who isn’t up to their necks into EVs is pretty much toast!</p><cite>Sandy Munro</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Auto Industry analysts are deprecated</h2>



<p>“I don’t take analysts seriously,” expresses Sandy Munro in his <a href="#video">interview video</a>. He even said that mainstream media is also skipping automotive analysts and taking the viewpoints of experts like him, it’s the new norm.</p>



<p>According to Sandy Munro’s analysis, 2021 is going to be a decisive year for the auto industry as <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/rivian/rivian-opens-configurator-package/">Rivian’s R1T Pickup Truck and R1S SUV</a> plus the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> deliveries will begin. It’s going to be hard on the traditional automotive companies.</p>



<h2>Rivian R1T vs. Hummer EV</h2>



<p>For his next teardown projects, Sandy Munro has already selected the Cybertruck but to meet the budget requirements, his company had to choose between the Rivian R1T and Hummer EV.</p>



<p>Munro &amp; Munro Associates ran a poll online and asked their 100k+ subscribers what they should do. According to Munro, 97% of the audience wanted to see the Rivian R1T teardown to its last screw. Rivian wins, Hummer EV loses — game over GMC.</p>



<h2>Giga Casting is the future of auto manufacturing</h2>



<p>For the past 10 years, Sandy Munro has been showing auto executives the giant underbody die casts sitting at his factory. “I think you’ve lost your mind,” this is the usual reply he got from them for all those years.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        

        <section>
            <p>With the announcement of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">App Store Small Business Program</a>, I’ve stopped selling Unbound directly via the web site. I thought it would be worth explaining how I came to that decision.</p>
            <p>The original motivation for selling the app directly was simple: Apple took a 30% cut of sales, whereas <a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>, the payment processor &amp; authentication tool I was using to sell directly only took [<em>not-publicly-disclosed-but-substantially-less-than–30</em>]%. With the drop in Mac App Store fees, that gap has shrunk considerably… to the point that it’s no longer worth keeping Paddle around.</p>
            <h2 id="directsalesareaworseexperienceforcustomers">1. Direct sales are a worse experience for customers.</h2>
            <p>From a customer’s perspective, every direct sale is its own little special snowflake, and you have to figure out how to get your license key, where in the app to enter it, etc. </p>
            <p>For the most tech-savvy users, this is pretty much a non-issue (until, of course, you migrate to a new computer and have to dig through your email to find your product key—good luck!). But a substantial percentage of users had trouble with this, and it was the #1 source of support requests for me.</p>
            <p>In contrast, virtually <em>every</em> Mac user is familiar with the Mac App Store. (And even if they aren’t, it can’t be a <em>worse</em> experience than trying to figure out a third-party platform!) Moving installs between machines is a non-issue, and there’s no such thing as an activation problem. </p>
            <h2 id="directsalesincreasetheoverheadofeachrelease">2. Direct sales increase the overhead of each release.</h2>
            <p>Unbound is not my day job, and revenue-wise, it probably doesn’t have any conceivable path to become my full-time income. (I’m measuring my income here in <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerAYoung/status/1341815721182056465" target="_blank">lattes per month</a>!) That means I can only work on it during nights &amp; weekends—a rather limited amount of time.</p>
            <p>For that reason, I want to maximize the time I actually spend shipping new features. Selling directly meant that I had to cut two builds, and go through two release processes, every time I wanted to ship an update. (And of course I’ve already mentioned the support burden of direct sales—support takes time directly away from development!)</p>
            <h2 id="directsalesareasecurityandprivacyliability">3. Direct sales are a security and privacy liability.</h2>
            <p>If Paddle suffered a data breach, suddenly <em>I</em> would be on the hook for exposing people’s emails or (God forbid) credit card data. While this has <em>not</em> happened, and I have no reason whatsoever to think Paddle is anything but competent, I’m still much happier trusting Apple’s security practices than <em>any</em> third party. (And if <em>Apple</em> has a security breach, I feel like I’m unlikely to take the blame from customers—the vast majority of them have done business with Apple directly in the past, whether for their computers, phones, or even just iTunes purchases.)</p>
            <p>Even apart from a data breach, removing all third parties from the equation is a privacy win for customers—I can proudly tell people the app collects <em>no</em> data whatsoever, whereas Paddle had to “phone home” to validate product keys.</p>
            <h2 id="itsjustnotworthitanymore">It’s just not worth it any more.</h2>
            <p>Given all that, the math just doesn’t work out in support of doing direct sales any more. Even if I moved sales to accepting credit cards directly, a 3.5% fee with all those downsides is substantially worse for both me and my customers than a flat 15%.</p>
            <p>Onward and upward!</p>

    <section>

<p>Tobi Lutke is the CEO of Shopify, which is a hugely successful E-Commerce company based out of Ottawa, Canada.</p>

<p>I find him interesting for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>He reasons from first principles about how to effectively build companies</li>
<li>He’s built a wildly successful technology company in a secondary market (i.e. not Silicon Valley)</li>
</ol>

<p>As someone that’s also trying to build a successful technology company in a secondary market (Ann Arbor), I’m definitely interested in what Lutke has to say.</p>

<p>One such piece of advice that he offers could be paraphrased as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When hiring in secondary markets, choose employees with the assumption that you’ll work together for at least 10 years.</p>

<p>That means that hiring based on the candidate’s growth potential is much more important than in primary markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This advice resonates with how I see people in Michigan view their jobs: generally, when they choose a job, they pick a job that they could see themselves working at for 5-10 years.</p>

<p>This contrasts sharply with Silicon Valley. If the average tenure at a company is two years, you can sure spend 5 hours each week mentoring Jill on how to better manage her team but gee whiz, by the time that actually starts to pay dividends she’s moved on to the company next door.</p>

<p>I do think that his “hire for growth” advice - while not <em>wrong</em>  - is at least insufficient to be useful. What does it mean to hire for growth? Does this mean not to hire senior engineers?</p>

<p>In this post, I’d like to carry forward Lutke’s first principles reasoning in order to determine how you should hire differently in secondary markets.</p>



<p>I like to think of what a candidate offers looks something like a layered cake: from bottom to top, the layers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foundational character traits</li>
<li>Foundational technical skills</li>
<li>Professional technical skills</li>
<li>Professional social skills</li>
</ul>

<p>The lower the layer in the cake, the harder it is to change that aspect of the person.</p>

<p>Starting with the bottom:</p>

<p><strong>Foundational character traits</strong> include how well someone can teach others, whether they can write well, whether they try to avoid the same mistake multiple times, and how eager they are to learn new things.</p>

<p>These traits take years to take shape and are often the direct result of someone’s upbringing and education. There’s a good chance that if you hire someone with a gap in one of these skills, you’re stuck with it.</p>

<p><strong>Foundational technical skills</strong> are the skills that someone needs before they can even really start grappling with the <em>real</em> skills that make them good at their job. For software engineers, you’re probably looking at someone that can program well in at least one or two languages, understands what a unit test is and how to write it, knows the basics of databases and networking, etc.</p>

<p>These skills are <em>certainly</em> teachable (as demonstrated by many-a CS curriculum). However, they’re wide-spanning enough that it likely takes years to learn them in a comprehensive way that ensures good coverage.</p>

<p>For example, when working on a project, it’s hard to justify stopping in the middle to take a few weeks and go learn SQL. If you make a hire without foundational technical skills, you’ll find that you’re often faced with two choices when you encounter one of these gaps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Halt whatever you’re working on and develop a plan to fill that knowledge gap</li>
<li>Do “just enough to get by” but never really fill the knowledge gap</li>
</ol>

<p>The first makes it hard to put this person on any sort of time sensitive project, while the latter never really addresses the problem.</p>

<p>That’s why I think that foundational technical skills are a must-have, even when hiring for junior positions.</p>

<p><strong>Professional technical skills</strong></p>

<p>These are the skills that get “layered on top of” the foundational technical skills in order to really make someone effective at their job.</p>

<p>For software engineers, I consider these skills the ones that basically no CS undergraduate will have learned in school. These are things like how to effectively monitor code running in production, design an API, or scale a service as it gets more usage.</p>

<p>These skills are often learned through a combination of actually facing the problem and having someone else around that’s faced it before and can help you learn how to solve it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the problems themselves are often ones that are hard to replicate in the classroom. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The solutions to these problems cost significant money (how to implement monitoring and APM services)</li>
<li>The problems only exist due to the volume of traffic that a service is receiving (how to effectively use a load balancer)</li>
<li>The problems only exist due to many engineers collaborating on a project (how to ensure consistent code styles and distribute knowledge of best practices)</li>
</ul>

<p>Junior engineers cannot be expected to have these skills.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because these skills are a result of facing the problem before and not all engineers specialize in all things, not all <em>senior</em> engineers should be expected to have these skills. However, senior engineers should be expected to have depth in <em>a few</em> of these areas and - if you’re hiring well - at least one of those areas hopefully addresses a pain point that your team currently has.</p>

<p>Hiring this way allows senior engineers to be the mentor necessary to effectively bring junior engineers and other senior engineers “up to their level” in their respective area of expertise.</p>

<p><strong>Professional social skills</strong></p>

<p>These skills are layered on top of even the professional technical skills and are the ones that allow someone to coordinate a group of people to work together and grow as a team.</p>

<p>I don’t have much insight to offer here: I’m still learning.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In secondary markets, hire for growth potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d like to offer a corollary to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In secondary markets, hire people who are both great teachers and avid learners.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Being an effective teacher requires a high level of empathy with the audience along with communication skills that are very, very hard to teach. That’s why I stuck it in the “foundational character traits” bucket above. It’s very likely that if you hire a bad teacher, they’ll remain a bad teacher.</p>

<p>The problem with this becomes apparent when you see what happens when you hire a bad teacher at each level:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you hire a senior engineer that’s a bad teacher, they’re unable to mentor the rest of the team in their domains of expertise. This means that you get minimal leverage on their skillset</li>
<li>If you hire a junior engineer that’s a bad teacher, you’re investing years of training into someone from whom you’ll ultimately get minimal leverage from their skillset</li>
</ul>

<p>In computer science terms, hiring good teachers yields superlinear returns because you benefit from both the work they do and the increased level of productivity they help others reach.</p>

<p>Hiring bad teachers yields a linear return because you benefit only from the work they do.</p>



<p>Along with teaching, there’s one other foundational trait that’s critical when hiring in secondary markets: the person has to be an avid and effective learner. A strong growth mindset is critical.</p>

<p>If you think of someone’s growth as a straight line, their attitude towards learning and their ability to effectively learn greatly influence the slope of that line. Finding effective learners is much more important when the time that the person will be spending with you is significant. In high-turnover primary markets, the skill change during the minimal time the employee spends with you is likely to be small regardless of their ability to learn, so you should hire them primarily based on their current abilities. This isn’t true when hiring in secondary markets.</p>



<ul>
<li>Carefully choose what foundational character traits you care about and figure out how to identify them in interviews.</li>
<li>In secondary markets, seek out great teachers and avid learners</li>
<li>Choose your foundational technical skills and figure out how to identify them in interviews.</li>
<li>Senior engineers should have depth in multiple areas, at least one of which will broaden the team’s overall expertise.</li>
</ul>

<p>“A street guy like T is a different kind of person. Everything for a guy like that, for, a member, is different. They’re in that private world of their own and that’s all they want to know. They’re in it all their lives. They’ve got fathers and uncles and cousins inside. They’re many inside and, believe me, they love it. They’re like gypsies, all by themselves with their secrets. They love to sit around and make deals with each other. Make their moves. When you and I are in bed, they’re making their moves.</p>
<p>“You should see them go through the papers in the morning, sucking their fingers and turning the page, sucking their fingers and turning the page, and then, when they get to something they like, they say, ‘Questo ca e una Cosa nostra,’ and that means, ‘This is something for us,’ you know what I mean? Believe me, when they go to church, because most of them are so religious they got saints hanging all over the walls of their houses, when they go to church they pray to God, ‘O Jesus, Mary and Joseph, give me the strength to rob again.’</p>
<p>“Even when they get arrested, and for them that’s no disgrace, they’re making their deals. They sit with each other in the cafes and with their lawyers. ‘Can we reach this guy?’ ‘Can we do it this way?’ ‘If we take a plea, can we make a bargain?’ That’s what they love. Always dealing. With the cops, the D.A., everybody. It’s like playing pinochle with prison sentences.</p>
<p>“I remember near the end of the war when T got drafted. In six months he was back on the street with a psycho discharge and 100 per cent disability from the Government. He was no more crazy than I am, but he kept yelling and banging his head on the floor and eating newspapers until they gave up. See what I mean? Always scheming. Not enough to be back on the street, he comes out with $350 a month clear for the rest of his life. I remember when he got out we had some birthday party for him. It was one of the only times I remember that he laughed, but he was still pretty young.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Frank Mari, alias Frankie T, alias Frank Russo, alias T, kissed his wife goodbye the morning of Sept. 18, shoved his forearm into the playful jaws of his white German shepherd, handed a small overnight bag to his bodyguard and drove away from his Searington, L.I., home for what many of his Mafia contemporaries feel was the last time. Within two weeks a story appeared on page 30 of <em>The New York Times</em> that read, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frank Mari, a gunman who survived three years of the Mafia’s “Banana War,” vanished more than two weeks ago and is now believed by Nassau County police to have been murdered, along with Michael Adamo.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is puzzling the police is whether the double killing—if that is what happened—marks renewal of the underworld war by friends of the exiled Joseph (Joe Bananas) Bonanno, or was the work of some of Mari’s associates jealous of his rapid rise as an underboss to Paul Sciacca, Bonanno’s successor ….</p>
<p>“Until we find the bodies, either dead or alive, we’re not sure of anything,” said a high New York police official. “It could be murder, and it could be that these two fellows had a reason for disappearing.”</p>
<p>Marl’s wife, Jane, and Adamo’s wife, Grace, did not report their husbands’ disappearance to the police immediately.</p>
<p>At 43 years Frank Mari was not one of the city’s most prominent mafiosi. He rarely found his name in the newspaper, and when he did it usually appeared midway down a list of multisyllabic surnames, most of which were either misspelled or followed by phony addresses. Frank Mari had never been arrested at any of the prestigious Apalachin‐style meetings, had never testified before a Congressional committee or had to duck the television crews and newsmen who waited outside police stations and legislative hearings. Joseph Valachi’s naming him a “soldier” in the Mafia family of Joseph Bonanno attracted no public attention and very little interest among the most ambitious prosecutors. Even his criminal record, which dates back to 1945 and includes eight arrests for a variety of charges from felonious assault to conspiracy to violate Federal narcotics laws, has only one conviction. In May of 1968 Frank Mari began to serve a three‐month jail term for illegal possession of a gun.</p>
<hr>
<p>Frank Mari was just one of 4,500 Federally certified Cosa Nostra members, and his life, like the lives of the majority of those pathologically defensive men, was inbred and insular. Mari’s father‐in‐law is a captain in the Bonanno family; his brother‐in‐Iaw is a soldier in the Genovese family, and 17 months before his disappearance he was credited with encouraging the marriage of his niece to the son of Paul Sciacca, then the boss of the entire Bonanno family. Like most mafiosi, Mari did not associate with anyone who was not either a member or related to a member of that exotic sub culture. Outsiders—all outsiders—are considered prey who can be lied to, cheated, frightened, robbed and murdered.</p>
<p>Around strangers Mari was silent, remote, and expressionless. His life was as narrowly prescribed as that of a Supreme Court justice. Reclusive, quiet and even dull, Mari lived with his wife and two daughters in middle‐class suburban community where he was considered a polite, if remote, neighbor. Mari’s son, a 21-year‐old law student, was away at school most of the time. Mari’s hobbies were limited to training his dog and collecting rare coins. His neighbors, who had heard of Mari’s Mafia connections, either refused to believe it or said it made no difference since he was more desirable than some of their other neighbors. Even a New York City patrolman who lived nearby said there was very little about Marl’s home life to criticize.</p>
<p>“He was always a gentleman,” the patrolman said. “Only time I ever saw him was when he was playing with his kids or when he was in the backyard on Saturday morning teaching his dog to be vicious.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Away from his home, Mari’s life appeared just as uneventful. During the day he always ate before or after the lunch and dinner hours to avoid being seated next to strangers, and he never ate in a restaurant where he did not know personally the owners and waiters. Despite the fact that both police and Mafia informers swear that Mari could be a cruel, ruthless killer, equally adept with gun, garrote or knife, he never acted precipitantly. Like millions of other Americans he was treated rudely by retail clerks; restaurants and bars sometimes padded his bills, and he had to wait in line to see first‐run films with his wife on Saturday night.</p>
<p>On occasion he did exercise his power as a member of the Honored Society in personal matters, but not often. Once a very close friend asked him to see what could be done about a narcotics pusher who was selling drugs around a Bronx school. The police, Mari’s friend said, could or would do nothing. Selling narcotics to strangers is business to the mafiosi, except when it threatens their homes. Therefore, when Mari had determined that the pusher was not connected with any Mafia family, or “mobbed up,” he ordered two goons sent to the school, where they mercilessly beat the man. The man fled the neighborhood and never returned.</p>
<p>On another occasion, Mari found out that a rare coin, worth $1,500, which he had intended to buy for his $19,000 collection, had been stolen from a coin dealer. According to several of his friends, Mari was agitated enough by the theft to dispatch some of his men to question fences all around the city. When they discovered who had done the job, Mari had the burglar’s Brooklyn house staked out as though the burglar were being set up for a hit. When the man got home and was confronted by four, tight‐lipped gunmen in two cars, he screamed that they couldn’t possibly want him, that there had to be some mistake. He was even more bewildered when his abductors took him before a Mafia coin collector who gave him $500 for the coin and sent him back to Brooklyn in chauffeured car with two bodyguards.</p>
<p>On still another occasion a local priest asked Mari if he could help the Christmas collection for the children of the poor. A few days later a truckload of toys was delivered to the church along with several racks of new children’s clothing and a cash gift of $2,000. Mari’s only stipulation was that he be acknowledged as the donor.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a Mafia soldier, Frank Mari knew that his telephone was tapped, his house was bugged and that three or four days every month he was the subject of a routine 24‐hour surveillance by either local or Federal agents. These, as well as thousands of other inconveniences, had long ago been incorporated into his life, just as they have become a part of the lives of other mafiosi. He knew that telephones were to be used sparingly and for only the briefest and most cryptic messages. Conversations about the brotherhood or indictable crimes were invariably held out of doors, usually while walking through crowded city streets with bodyguard or “shooter” near by. During such walks Mari employed the old jailhouse technique of using a news paper, handkerchief or even his hand to cover his mouth in an attempt to thwart lip readers.</p>
<p>Mari avoided telephones to such an extent that he would not use even the public phones in the immediate vicinity of his house. Mafiosi insist that the F.B.I. deliberately breaks most of the pay telephones in the vicinity of their homes, then taps the few that are left working. On the days when Mari was under surveillance he followed a common Mafia police practice, worked out for their mutual convenience, whereby his daily itinerary was shown to the lawmen so that if they became accidentally separated in traffic during the day, the police tail could always pick him up at the next stop. On such days, of course, most of Mari’s illegal activities were taken care of by his associates or relatives.</p>
<hr>
<p>Until his disappearance, Frank Mari ruled a million dollar Mafia conglomerate from a chair outside a dingy, storefront social club on Manhattan’s …</p></div></div>

<p>In future, all swisstopo's standard digital products, such as digital maps, aerial photographs and landscape models, will be available free of charge as Open Government Data and will be freely usable. These will be made available in such a way that users can acquire them independently from the Internet.<br>
</p>
<p>The Federal Council took a first step on 3 April 2020 with the amendment of the Geoinformation Ordinance. This forms the legal basis for the free distribution of all swisstopo's standard digital products as Open Government Data. The associated annual revenue shortfall of CHF 4 to 5 million was approved by Parliament in the budget debate of December 2020. From 1 March 2021, swisstopo digital standard products will therefore be available online free of charge.<br>

<li>In order to be able to provide geodata free of charge subsequent to a positive decision by Parliament, swisstopo will need to adapt its IT systems. The adaptation will take a certain amount of time so that data can be obtained free of charge from 1 March 2021 at the earliest.</li>

<p>You might think that Mason jars are simply a staple of hipster home goods. But it turns out that demand for Mason jars — their lids, to be exact — are a remarkably accurate indicator of economic uncertainty. According to journalist Jen Doll who penned “<a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-everyones-suddenly-hoarding-mason-jars-4fe8cc1e098f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Everyone’s Suddenly Hoarding Mason Jars</a>“:</p>



<blockquote><p>The runs on Mason jars tend to occur when there is some kind of economic instability, recessions, in wartime, basically, anytime that people start to freak out about where they’re going to get their food, if they’re going to have enough food, what is happening in the world.”</p><cite>Interview on <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/12/07/why-demand-for-mason-jars-surges-in-times-of-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketplace</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Mason jar historians (yes, that’s a thing) have been able to correlate spikes in Mason jar sales to: the Great Depression &amp; World War II, the back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s &amp; 80s, Y2K, the 2009 Recession and now 2020. Like squirrels hiding their nuts for the winter, people have jarred what they can in preparation for the end times, once again. </p>



<p>Doll’s story got us thinking about other products that thrive when apocalypse is in the air. Toilet paper, bottled water, canned goods, guns, gold… and that led us to wonder: </p>



<p><strong>Is Bitcoin a product of the doomsday industry?</strong></p>



<h2>Born out of chaos</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-next-x-men-apocalypse-gone-rogue-113217.jpg?resize=452%2C340&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="452" height="340" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-next-x-men-apocalypse-gone-rogue-113217.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-next-x-men-apocalypse-gone-rogue-113217.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>For starters, Bitcoin was born right after the markets collapsed in 2008. The creator of Bitcoin even <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">referenced a news article</a> about a second round of bailouts in the UK in the initial block of transactions recorded to the Bitcoin blockchain. Some viewed Bitcoin as both a solution to and a rebuke of the current financial system.</p>



<p>Now, we aren’t here to debate if the central banks did the right thing. But the bailouts rubbed many people the wrong way. You had powerful government officials helping the financial elite, i.e. their buddies at the country club. A lot of Wall Street typically lobbies against social programs that help lower income groups, yet here they were accepting handouts from the government. And there was the “moral hazard” of not allowing the invisible hand of the markets to do its work — penalize risky lenders and borrowers — and allow these actors to self-correct rather than be saved. </p>



<p>The financial crisis also brought to light aspects of the modern financial system that disturbed many people. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Too Big to Fail – The financial system hinging on a select group of massive banks. Many believe you couldn’t let the banks fail even if they deserved to, otherwise everyone would get screwed.</li><li>Fractional Reserve &amp; Interbank Lending – Banks lending out far more money than they had in reserves (fractional reserves) and lending to each other (interbank lending). Banks are so interconnected that if one can’t make good on returning money to its lenders, all banks can be in trouble. </li><li>Modern Monetary Theory – Government central banks “printing money” to keep the retail banks afloat. They did this by buying the bad debt from the retail banks at way-above-market-prices. This allowed retail banks to put cash in their reserves and stay afloat.</li></ul>



<p>(<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/macroeconomics-income-inequality/the-2008-financial-crisis/v/bailout-1-liquidity-vs-solvency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kahn Academy</a> does an awesome job of breaking down the 2008 financial crisis if you want an easy-to-understand, in-depth look).</p>



<p>In the context of that time period, Bitcoin had a lot of appeal:</p>



<ul><li>No need for intermediaries, i.e. banks. Bitcoin allows you to transact with and store your coins on your own.</li><li>More fairness. Because Bitcoin is code, it doesn’t have any human biases deciding who gets a bailout and who doesn’t. In fact, there is no mechanism for bailouts. Everyone needs to be self-sufficient.</li><li>No single point of failure. Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol. No single party (or select few) can bring it all to a halt if they screw up.</li><li>What you see is what you get. The blockchain lets you see the coins you have access to. It’s not a representation of what you are owed, which is what you see when you log into your online account at Chase or Bank of America. It’s actually there.</li><li>No arbitrary money printing. Hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol is a limit on the total supply of Bitcoin. There will never be more than 21 million coins unless 51% of all miners vote otherwise, and that is highly unlikely.</li></ul>



<p>In other words, Bitcoin was born out of chaos.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2020 — global pandemic, massive unemployment, political polarization, violent protests, <em>etcetera</em>.</p>



<p>And the price of Bitcoin just cracked its all-time high.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="665" height="388" src="https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=665%2C388&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C598&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=768%2C449&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=660%2C385&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?w=1303&amp;ssl=1 1303w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Back in the early years of Bitcoin, there was a narrative that Bitcoin was digital money. But that’s lost momentum for a variety of reasons: its price has been too volatile, government regulation, transaction fees have been too high which makes smaller transactions impractical, consumer user experience has been lacking, etc. </p>



<p>Since then, the narrative has evolved to focus on Bitcoin’s abilities as a store of value. Like gold, <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/why-bitcoin-is-called-digital-gold-and-why-store-of-value-is-a-bullshit-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation</a>. </p>



<p>During these “unprecedented times” of 2020, Bitcoin proponents point to record low interest rates and the massive money printing done by governments to stimulate/ prop up economies. They tout that Bitcoin will become THE way to preserve wealth. And people are buying it (both the story being told and Bitcoin itself).</p>



<p>In this narrative, it feels like Bitcoin’s ultimate success — to be the end-all-be-all store of value — depends on the complete and utter failure of our current monetary system. Ya know, doomsday.</p>



<h2>Trust issues</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="531" height="403" src="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/344082-Two-Reasons-I-Don-t-Trust-People.jpg?resize=531%2C403&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/344082-Two-Reasons-I-Don-t-Trust-People.jpg?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/344082-Two-Reasons-I-Don-t-Trust-People.jpg?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Why people hoard Mason jars during times of economic uncertainty is not clear. Sure, some people are doing it to cut costs. But in interviewing historians, Doll found that people may be subconsciously motivated by a desire for control:</p>



<blockquote><p>When there are these big downfalls of trust in systems of government or economy or institutions, there’s this desire to retain control wherever we can find it… Growing your own garden or canning your own food offers a sense of transparency, even if it’s an illusion. You don’t just have to trust in the system.&nbsp; </p><cite>Anna Zeide, PhD, author of&nbsp;<em>Canned: The Rise and Fall of Consumer Confidence in the American Food Industry</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Hmmmm, is it just us, or could Zeide talking about crypto? </p>



<p>If you’ve read about crypto or listened to podcasts, you’ll know that “trust”, “trustless” and “trustlessness” are basically crypto bingo words. There are even diehards in the crypto community who say “not your keys, not your coins” because they don’t trust custodial services to manage their cryptocurrency. They want sole control, even though <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-wallet-vs-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-custodying can be just as risky</a>, if not more.</p>



<p>Let’s modify what Zeide said: “When there are these big downfalls of trust in systems of government or economy or institutions, there’s this desire to retain control wherever we can find it… <strong>Keeping your money in crypto</strong> offers a sense of transparency, even if it’s an illusion. You don’t just have to trust in the system.”</p>



<p>It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that the psychology behind hoarding Mason jars feels strangely familiar to buying up Bitcoin. </p>



<h2>The Pinterest-Etsy-DIY-farm-chic-urban-boho-avocado-toast market</h2>



<p>As you may know, Mason jars experienced a renaissance in the 2010’s when it captured the mindshare of the Pinterest-Etsy-DIY-farm-chic-urban-boho-avocado-toast market (or PEDYFCUBAT, for short). 200+ years after its invention, Mason jars became in vogue independent of any major global crisis. Huzzah!</p>



<p>Bitcoin could find it’s version of the PEDYFCUBAT market, too (though ideally faster than a couple hundred years). Personally speaking, we think Bitcoin hasn’t reached market saturation yet. And its price will eventually end up coming to a kind of steady-state, which it will then fluctuate around. (This is <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/is-cryptocurrency-a-good-investment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why we bet on Bitcoin</a>, in spite of all the hype).</p>



<h2>End of the beginning</h2>



<p>This week, the coronavirus vaccine is rolling out to healthcare workers and vulnerable populations, and the FDA continues to authorize more vaccines. While we’re not out of the woods economically speaking, this may be the beginning of the end. One cannot help but wonder: if the economy recovers and we’re “back to normal”, will Bitcoin’s bright star fade as well?</p>



<p>Until the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it arrives, perhaps Bitcoin is not on an exponential trajectory upwards. Bitcoin demand might be more like the Mason jar’s — growing slowly, jumping and falling sharply along the way, in sync with seasons of economic instability.</p>

                <p>hyper v0.14
I’m so thrilled to announce the release of <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhyperium%2Fhyper%2Freleases%2Ftag%2Fv0.14.0&amp;t=YjBhMDhjMzdhMjEyMmRlNDAyZWM3YjVkYjI3NTQ5Y2JmYTk3MWZjMSxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">hyper v0.14</a> today. <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fhyper.rs&amp;t=Y2NjNWY0NzY4MWIzMjdhMDgyYjM2MzBjMWQ5Mzc1ODkxYjBhMWI4NCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">hyper</a> is a safe, reliable, fast HTTP library written in Rust. It provides asynchronous client and server APIs, supporting both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.</p><h3>What’s this release all about?</h3><h4>Tokio 1.0</h4><p>Today also sees the release of <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftokio.rs%2Fblog%2F2020-12-tokio-1-0&amp;t=NWU5OGY3YzdlM2YyNzZkNjUxNmQ1NDBiMWJlMjdlZjRkZDg3MmJmMCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">Tokio v1.0</a>. We wanted to ensure that with that momentous release, hyper was ready immediately so the ecosystem can start using it right away. This change doesn’t have much of an outward effect on hyper’s API, but is a big step towards stabilizing the Rust networking experience.</p><h4>Optional Main Features</h4><p>hyper has had optional features for a while, such as optional support for the Tokio. This allows convenient usage with the excellent Tokio runtime, while allowing others who have an existing runtime to just use hyper for its HTTP bits.</p><p>In this release, however, we’ve made the main pieces of hyper optional features.</p><ul><li><code>http1</code></li><li><code>http2</code></li><li><code>client</code></li><li><code>server</code></li></ul><p>These features cover the largest parts of hyper, its protocol implementations. With these now able to be enabled or disabled, you can significantly reduce the amount of code you compile and include in hyper. For example, if you’re application always talks to an HTTP/1 server, you can enable just the <code>http1</code> and <code>client</code> features. Or <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhyperium%2Ftonic&amp;t=Mjk3NzIxM2RkZGJkMTgyYzc3NDJjNTcyYmNjNGIwYzVjZjc3ZGM5YixVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">Tonic</a>, a Rust gRPC library, since it is based on HTTP/2, it can disable the HTTP/1 code in hyper, enabling only <code>http2</code>, <code>client</code>, and <code>server</code>.</p><h3>What’s next?</h3><p>This release is timed to go out with <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftokio.rs%2Fblog%2F2020-12-tokio-1-0&amp;t=NWU5OGY3YzdlM2YyNzZkNjUxNmQ1NDBiMWJlMjdlZjRkZDg3MmJmMCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">Tokio v1.0</a>, and notably isn’t hyper 1.0 yet. That means we’re not done. Here’s what we have planned coming soon:</p><h4>Stability</h4><p>We have our eyes set on making hyper stable, with a 1.0 release. We know many people rely on hyper to make fast, reliable HTTP applications and libraries, and it’s a top priority to make hyper stable and no longer need breaking changes.</p><p>Stability is also meant in terms of reliability: we’ll continue to fix bugs, improve performance, and undertake internal refactors that shouldn’t affect the API, but will result in more and more reliable HTTP for users.</p><h4>Simplification</h4><p>As part of the drive to stabilization and 1.0, we will be making strides towards simplifying the public API exposed in hyper. Simplifying things can mean different things, so for hyper, it refers to removing the more opinionated pieces. That means aiming to embrace the “low level” aspect of hyper, and moving more “high level” pieces into other libraries.</p><h4>C API</h4><p>Stabilizing and simplifying doesn’t mean nothing new is coming. New things are being worked on <em>right now</em>, but with great care to not disrupt the stabilization efforts.</p><p>hyper is a <em>safe</em>, correct, fast HTTP implementation written in Rust, and as it matures, the desire to use that safety in places that <em>aren’t</em> Rust grows. We’ve been working on a <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhyperium%2Fhyper%2Fpull%2F2278&amp;t=NTMxZDZhODcwZTNkOTBmY2Q4NGYwY2ZmOTRmZTRhMWYxODA3MzAzNyxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">C API</a> for hyper, with the first main user being the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdaniel.haxx.se%2Fblog%2F2020%2F10%2F09%2Frust-in-curl-with-hyper%2F&amp;t=NjJmNzI3N2FjMDRhMDc4YTBlN2Y1ZDcyM2IxMmMyNzYzNTJjYjg1MCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">curl</a> project. We’re so excited to be part of this effort for a <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abetterinternet.org%2Fpost%2Fmemory-safe-curl%2F&amp;t=ZGIwMmVkNGU5NGJkYmRlOTk2MzA3ZDYyNWE4Njk1MGYxZTRiZWE2NixVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">memory safe ‘curl’</a>, and you can already experimentally <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcurl%2Fcurl%2Fwiki%2FHyper&amp;t=MTVkNTkyYzlkOTBkYTZlZWQxMWZiZGQ5N2E3ZjkxMTg5YTkxYjgwOCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706">try it out</a>!</p><p>To re-emphasize the stability and simplification goals, the first parts of this C API are based on the “lower level” client connection API in hyper. As hyper is used throughout curl’s extensive test suite, hyper’s Rust internals handle more edge cases and protocol features, which is a <strong>win for all hyper users</strong>, even if you don’t use the thin C API part.</p><h4>HTTP/3</h4><p>In the greater Internet, work has been progressing on stabilizing QUIC and the next version of HTTP, HTTP/3. We’ve started an effort on the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhyperium%2Fh3&amp;t=OTEyMjU1YjQxZTU3ZmYzNjBmYWY1M2FmNzc4MDA5YTdjOTJhOTFjZCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032706"><code>h3</code></a> library, which provides HTTP/3 while being generic over a QUIC implementation. There’s been great progress, with a working client example already in the repository.</p><h3>Come join us!</h3><p>This release is an important step for hyper. But as you can see, there’s still plenty to be done.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url/blob/master/PULSE_URL.ipynb"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/52feade06f2fecbf006889a904d221e6a730c194/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url">Github link</a></p>

<p>PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration) is a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03808">algorithm</a> published in 2020 that generates a high resolution facial image from a low resolution one. The main idea is to encode a low resolution image to a latent variable with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GAN</a>, change the latent variable a little bit, and generate a new but highly similar image.</p>

<p>To make it easier for anyone to try out PULSE, I wrote a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url/blob/master/PULSE_URL.ipynb">COLAB notebook</a> that takes an image URL (such as those obtained from Google image search), performs downsampling, and then upsampling with PULSE.</p>

<p>Instruction to run</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url/blob/master/PULSE_URL.ipynb">COLAB notebook</a></li>
  <li>Click “Connect” button on top right to connect to the GPU server.</li>
  <li>Replace Photo_URL with an URL of your interest</li>
  <li>Click the play button on the left of the second cell.</li>
</ol>

<p>It usually takes a minute or two to generate a new image.</p>

<p>Below are a few examples. Image on the left is the original, middle one is the downsampled original, and the right one is the image generated by PULSE.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse1.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pretty good! You may think. Things go a bit haywire with some images…</p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse3.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse_senior2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see, the generator is biased towards white young-looking adults. In fact there have been a lot of discussion around bias implicit in machine learning models. To sum up, it’s all about the training data. The models simply fill in the gap based on what they saw from the training data. The PULSE model was trained with the a <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset">dataset of Flickr images</a> and inherited all its bias. The bias issue can likely be resolved by carefully selecting a dataset with diverse age, ethnicity and gender.</p>

		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        <p>If I am to start working on a new project today, I would hesitate to attempt it in a language that does not have compile-time type checking. However, I do have to deal with Python at work (though we are slowly phasing it out). Also, I have been working off and on, in my spare time, on a Python project that has over the past 3+ years gotten fairly large as personal projects go. It started out as a one-off quick script. It eventually evolved into something larger that actually does something useful for me so I ended up adding to it and maintaining it.</p>

<p>Somewhere over a year and a half back, after being frustrated with my inability to refactor this code like I can with other type safe languages, I started exploring the possibility of adding type hints to the codebase. Now, after having spent the requisite time to understand the implications of type hinting, and whether it’s useful, and to be able to show this as a consolidation of my thoughts on the matter to friends and colleagues, I decided to write this post on what an <strong>absolute joy</strong> it has become to refactor and work with Python once you have type checking enforced.</p>

<p>Just to set expectations right: the following is more of gushing praise for <code>mypy</code> rather than <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html">a tutorial on how to use it</a>. If you are already using <code>mypy</code> on a regular basis, you are likely going to learn little from what follows. This is written with the hope of giving other friends of mine who are Python programmers an overview of starting with type annotations, if they aren’t already using them by detailing the nice things it provides. It also details some of the effort you will likely need to pay up front to make type-checking effective in your codebase, and the rough edges (yes, there are some) in the type annotation system that will likely cause you some annoyance.</p>

<p>Another expectation I’d like to calibrate is for people coming to this from a language with a sophisticated type system such as Rust or Haskell, or even more traditional type systems like Java and C++. These are things you take for granted and you will likely scoff at some of the things written here. However, I urge you to look at the benefits the following provide to the current state of Python programming that has no static type checking.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-type-annotations-in-python">Overview of Type Annotations in Python</h2>

<p>First things first: Python, back from versions 3.5+, has already had support for type annotations. It is detailed in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a>. This means that you can write functions that look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, the Python interpreter in no way enforces it, and will not enforce it in future. Python is expected to remain a dynamically typed language for the foreseeable future. The above function will run happily if called with <code>sum("hello", "world")</code> and return a concatenation of the two strings contrary to the intended use of the function. The Python interpreter simply ignores the type annotations.</p>

<p>However, you can use third party type checkers which will do static analysis of your code based on these type annotations and point out any type errors lurking in your code. The introduction of type annotations as part of the language syntax itself provides for much better aesthetics as compared to having to retrofit the type hints via code comments (a la Flow for pre ES6 JavaScript) and better ergonomics as compared to needing a transpiler to convert a new augmented language to valid vanilla code (like Typescript does).</p>

<p>One such type-checker is <code>mypy</code> - the earliest implementation of its kind that some of the Python core team are involved in, including the venerable Guido Van Rossum. However, note that<code>mypy</code> is a distinct from the Python interpreter and <a href="http://www.mypy-lang.org/">maintained as a separate project</a>. You will need to download and install it separately.</p>

<p>Running <code>mypy</code> on a file containing the aforementioned invocation of the <code>sum</code> function above with string arguments results in the following error from the type checker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Argument 2 to "sum" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>mypy</code> is not the only type checker out there. There are other type checkers such as <code>Pyright</code> from Microsoft and <code>pyre</code> from Facebook. However, my experience with them is limited and the following notes are based on my experience with <code>mypy</code> exclusively.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-love">Things I love</h2>

<p>The trivial example that I stated above does not do justice to the sophistication that <code>mypy</code> brings. While you will need to grapple with installing, configuring it and running it on your code, in this section I’ll be detailing some of my favourite things it facilitates once you pay that price.</p>

<h3 id="optional-values-strictly-enforced">Optional Values, Strictly Enforced</h3>

<p>If there is a single thing that you can take away from this post, it ought to be the unreasonable effectiveness of strictly checked optional values. Just this one feature has had such a dramatic improvement on my code correctness that I cannot emphasise this enough.</p>

<p>Errors in software arising from not checking for nulls is <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/">“a billion dollar problem”</a> and <code>mypy</code> is an invaluable guard against them. The primary type annotation (<em>type modifier</em> in <code>mypy</code> terms) that helps with this is the <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns#result-container"><code>Optional</code></a> annotation. In my opinion, explicitly handling and indicating where a value can be null fosters greater code correctness as  to approaches in languages like Java where any value can potentially be null.</p>

<p>Consider a canonical ‘customer record’ management scenario (yes, I’m unimaginative like that). Presumably, a simple customer type could be defined like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>:</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this type, we encode the fact that we may sometime not have the customer’s address registered in our database, into the type itself. In vanilla Python without annotations, we would have just defined it as a string with the possibility that it may be <code>None</code> that we need to ‘remember’ any time we used it.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the utility of <code>Optional</code> type used in conjunction with <code>mypy</code>, let’s look at a (slightly contrived) example of an implementation checking how far a customer resides from our store. To simplify the example, we abstract away the details of looking up a <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-simple">Geocoding service</a> and code to calculate distance between two geo-coordinates.</p>

<p>A first iteration of this code might look like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># A type alias for a (lat, long) tuple
</span><span>Coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tuple</span><span>[</span><span>float</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>geo_lookup</span><span>(</span><span>input_address</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Coords</span><span>]:</span>
    <span># ... snip ...
</span>    <span># Geocoding API lookup
</span>    <span># Hardcoding return for now
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>12.972442</span><span>,</span> <span>77.580643</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate_distance_in_miles</span><span>(</span><span>coord1</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>,</span> <span>coord2</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ... snip ...
</span>    <span># Distance computation
</span>    <span># Hardcoding return for now
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>3.5</span>

<span># WARNING: Buggy code below
</span><span>def</span> <span>get_delivery_distance</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>:</span> <span>Customer</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>geo_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>geo_lookup</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>address</span><span>)</span> <span># Errors here
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>calculate_distance_in_miles</span><span>(</span><span>geo_coords</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this through <code>mypy</code> generates the following errors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>geo.py:18: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "Optional[Tuple[float, float]]", variable has type "Tuple[float, float]")
geo.py:18: error: Argument 1 to "geo_lookup" has incompatible type "Optional[str]"; expected "str"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can imagine, this is quite a lifesaver in more real world conditions. <code>mypy</code> just caught the error of using <code>customer.address</code> without checking if it is <code>None</code>. It also caught the bug where we are trying to assign the <code>geo_coords</code> value to the return from <code>geo_lookup</code> without accounting for the fact that it too can return <code>None</code>.</p>

<p>The corrected version of the <code>get_delivery_distance</code> would look like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get_delivery_distance</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>:</span> <span>Customer</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>float</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>address</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>geo_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Coords</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>geo_lookup</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>address</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>geo_coords</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>calculate_distance_in_miles</span><span>(</span><span>geo_coords</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, we take change the return type of <code>get_delivery_address</code> to account for the possibility that it may be <code>None</code>. Furthermore, we expressly handle both the possibility of <code>customer.address</code> being <code>None</code> as well as the return from the geocoding lookup service being <code>None</code>. As you see, <code>mypy</code> cleverly infers that you have indeed handled the <code>None</code> cases appropriately and hence does not throw errors in the new code.</p>

<p>As you can observe, this enforcement of checking for optional values cascades through your codebase and <code>mypy</code> is always looking over your shoulders to warn you against potential places where you have not handled them. Furthermore, it’s very cool that <code>mypy</code> manages to do a significant amount of type inference based on the conditional blocks, looking for checks for <code>None</code>. Contrast this with languages like C++ where, in code written with the equivalent  <code>std::optional</code> calls to <code>std::optional::value()</code> method will happily compile, and fail at runtime throwing a <code>bad_optional_access</code> exception if in fact it holds only a null value.</p>

<p>If you are a Rust or Haskell programmer, you are at this point cringing at all the conditional checks, and missing your <code>Either</code> s and <code>Maybe</code>s. There are some <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns#result-container">third party libraries</a> that (sorta) provide these for you though I have not used these in my code.</p>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>The irony of lauding the support for generics in the type annotations of a language that is intrinsically dynamically typed is not lost on me. Nevertheless, as soon as you enter the world that is typed Python even if it’s make believe, you start needing generics. Thankfully, the support for it is quite nice.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet plagiarised entirely from the <code>mypy</code> <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#defining-generic-classes">documentation</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>)</span>

<p>This is a rough idea for an admittedly not hugely useful technical 
hack related to low-level network protocol gubbins. If you don't want to 
know about this, look away now.</p>

<p>I will assume you know what <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">TCP</a> is (oh - i'll
warn you now that i say 'packet' instead of 'segment' throughout this
document; i'm like that). I will assume you know what the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xns/syssocket.h.html">POSIX
socket API</a> almost universally used to access it is. What you may or
may not know about are the two things i'm going to talk about today: the
sequenced packet (aka SOCK_SEQPACKET) socket type from the socket API
and the urgent pointer from the TCP specification.</p>

<p>The socket API supports sockets of several types; 'type' does not
refer to the protocol behind the socket, but rather to the semantics
associated with the socket. The best-known socket types are stream
(SOCK_STREAM) and datagram (SOCK_DGRAM); the former supplies a pair of
full-duplex, reliable, ordered, structureless byte streams connected to
a single remote socket, while the latter supplies an aperture through
which unreliable, unordered, smallish bundles of bytes can be sent to
multiple remote sockets. There are, however, other socket types; the 
most interesting is the sequenced-packet socket (SOCK_SEQPACKET). The <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/xsh_chap02_10.html">actual 
text</a> of the socket API specification says of sequenced packet 
sockets:</p>

<blockquote>The SOCK_SEQPACKET socket type is similar to the SOCK_STREAM
type, and is also connection-oriented. The only difference between these
types is that record boundaries are maintained using the SOCK_SEQPACKET
type. A record can be sent using one or more output operations and
received using one or more input operations, but a single operation
never transfers parts of more than one record. Record boundaries are
visible to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag in the received message
flags returned by the recvmsg() function. It is protocol-specific
whether a maximum record size is imposed.</blockquote>

<p>So basically, it's either a sequence of packets which are delivered
reliably and in order, or a reliable, ordered stream with record
boundaries in it, depending on how you look at it. Either way, it's
clearly halfway between stream (ie TCP) and datagram (ie UDP) sockets.
The stuff about MSG_EOR is how you mark the ends of messages; messages
are read and written like stream data, but with a couple of nuances: to
mark the end of a message when sending, set the MSG_EOR flag in the last
send(), and to detect the end of a message when receiving, use recvmsg()
and look for the MSG_EOR flag in the msghdr.msg_flags field.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, that line saying "a record can be sent using one or
more output operations and received using one or more input operations"
is a bit weird; the specs for recv() and recvmsg() say "for
message-based sockets such as SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire
message must be read in a single operation.". There's a <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/austin-review-l/msg00839.html">post
on an Open Group mailing list</a> on the semantics of the MSG_WAITALL
flag in the context of sequenced packet sockets which indicates that
messages on a sequenced packet socket can indeed be delivered through
multiple recv() calls, which does make more sense; you can then use
MSG_WAITALL to force delivery in a single read, although it doesn't work
if the message is bigger than your buffer)</p>

<p>Moreover, sequenced packet sockets are probably the most
programmer-friendly kind: they have strong reliability and ordering
guarantees (like TCP but unlike UDP), and they provide record
demarcation at the protocol level (like UDP but unlike TCP); they should
therefore be a key tool for network programmers. However, as far as i
can tell, there is no internet transport-layer protocol in common use
which has sequenced packet semantics; SOCK_SEQPACKET is therefore not a
generally available socket type! Where it does turn up is when you're
running connections straight over ATM or IR or other suitable link
layers, and nobody cares about that.</p>

<p>But all is not lost! I have come up with a way to supply sequenced
packet semantics using entirely normal TCP, by exploiting a little-used
but historically ancient feature of that protocol which, i think, was
designed expressely for that purpose: the urgent pointer.</p>

<p>The TCP spec is pretty brief, so have a read through and see what it
says about the the urgent pointer. Basically, it's a facility by which
one end of a TCP connection can indicate to the other that there's
urgent data somewhere in the stream. From the client (ie
application-layer protocol) point of view, it looks like there's a
button next to the output stream of each socket, with a red light next
to the input stream of the other, both labelled 'URGENT!!!'; one end
writes some data that it thinks is urgent, then hits the button: the
light at the other end then goes on immediately, and goes off once the
client has read all the data that the sender had written before hitting
the button. The TCP modules handle this by dint of two components of
their packets: the 'urgent pointer field significant' (aka URG) control
bit, and the urgent pointer (UP). The URG bit is set in all packets sent
after the button is pressed, up to and including the one containing the
last byte of urgent data; the presence of a set URG bit in a packet
therefore indicates to the receiving TCP module that it should switch on
the urgency light. The UP points to the last byte of the urgent data
(RFC 793 is confused about this - see <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">RFC 1122</a>, section
4.2.2.4, for the correction); the receiving module can turn off the
urgency light once the client has read that byte.</p>

<p>For completeness, i should point out that the UP field in the TCP
header is actually only 16 bits long; it expresses the UP as an offset
from the sequence number of the packet. RFC 793 is cagey about what
happens when the UP is more than 65535 greater than the current sequence
number, but <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2147.txt" a="">RFC
2147</a> says, inter alia:</p>

<blockquote>When a TCP packet is to be sent with an Urgent Pointer
(i.e., the URG bit set), first calculate the offset from the Sequence
Number to the Urgent Pointer. If the offset is less than 65535, fill in
the Urgent field and continue with the normal TCP processing. If the
offset is greater than 65535, and the offset is greater than or equal to
the length of the TCP data [which it will be, unless you're dealing with
super-jumbograms], fill in the Urgent Pointer with 65535 and continue
with the normal TCP processing.</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, i propose abusing the urgent mechanism to mark the ends of
messages: the urgent pointer simply points to the end of the current
message. Rather than connecting this to buttons and lights, the
seqpacket-aware TCP module does the right thing with MSG_EOR: MSG_EOR
being set in send() causes the UP to be set, and hitting the UP when
doing recvmsg() causes it to set MSG_EOR. Simple!</p>

<p>There is one little problem, which is that you can't pack multiple
messages into a single TCP packet, since you wouldn't be able to have
the UP pointing at the ends of all of them. This is a shame, but not
that big a deal; the whole sequenced packet thing is about reasonably
big packets. If a burning need for multiple messages per packets was
felt, w e could specify a negotiable TCP option to hold additional
message-end pointers.</p>

<p>There is some degree of interaction between the mechanism i describe
and TCP's push function. The push function was specified in part so that
applications can indicate to the TCP module when they'd got to the end
of a block of data, so that it does not waste time waiting for more;
with explicit message boundaries, it can work this out itself. TCP
modules should send less-than-MTU packets when and only when a message
end is signalled; the rest of the time, they should wait for enough data
from the client to fill a complete packet, without any timeout. As well
as rendering the push function obsolete, explicit message boundaries
also make Nagle's algorithm unnecessary. The push function can, however,
be repurposed: explicit pushes can be applied to indicate that a message
should be delivered as quickly as possible (the push should be signalled
in the same send that delivers the end-of-message indication). The TCP
modules should then do everything they can to deliver the message
quickly, and should indicate to the user that the message was pushed. 
Both these interactions with the user can be mediated by a MSG_PUSH flag
in the send() or recvmsg() flags (and perhaps a MSG_PUSH_PENDING flag in
recvmsg(), to indicate that a message somewhere ahead is being pushed).
The push would be communicated in the TCP packets by the setting of the
PSH flag, as now. We might even enable out-of-order delivery of the
pushed message, but that would be very weird. In essence, we're swapping
the semantics of the push and urgent functions!</p>

<![CDATA[Finding Software Bugs Using Symbolic Execution]]>

<article>
    <p>The idea of dynamic <em>symbolic execution</em> is to execute a piece of software on any input.
All possible execution paths are explored simultaneously without specifying concrete values.
Consider the following example where the input <code>x</code> is unknown, i.e., symbolic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span></span><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span></span><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>"should not reach this!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Symbolic execution runs this code on all three <em>execution paths</em> (<code>x&lt;0</code>, <code>x&gt;100</code>, <code>0&lt;=x&lt;=100</code>) and generates three concrete test cases: <code>x=-1</code>, <code>x=101</code> and <code>x=23</code> after hitting the assertion.</p>
<p>You don’t need to write test cases manually anymore.
You catch assertion failures and memory safety errors along the execution paths.
Ok, that is all in theory, but can this approach work for real-world programs in practice?</p>
<h3 id="klee">KLEE</h3>
<p><a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a> is a symbolic execution engine that executes unmodified, real-world programs on any input.
You compile your program to <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> bitcode, mark some inputs as symbolic, and start KLEE.
KLEE explores possible execution paths using constraint solving and generates concrete test cases for each of them.
In case of a bug, you can replay your program with the input that triggered it.</p>
<p>In November 2019, the seminal <a href="http://llvm.org/pubs/2008-12-OSDI-KLEE.html">OSDI 2008 paper</a> on KLEE <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/193808/paper-co-authored-professor-cadar-elected-acm/">has been elected to ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame</a>.
Over the past decade, the research and application of KLEE resulted in over 150 scientific publications, dozens of Ph.D. theses, research grants, tools, and security startups.
On my behalf, I spent more than five years of my life with KLEE as well and learned a lot along the way.</p>
<h3 id="testing-network-protocols-using-klee">Testing Network Protocols Using KLEE</h3>
<p>In 2007, I struggled to find my research thesis until I came across Cristian Cadar’s paper <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cristic/talks/exe-ccs-2006.pdf">“EXE: Automatically Generating Inputs of Death”</a>.
Inspired by the idea of symbolic execution, I asked myself the following question: <em>Can I mark the protocol header of an incoming network packet symbolic before passing it to the network stack?
If so, can I find protocol specification and implementation bugs with this technique?</em></p>
<p>I wrote an e-mail to Cristian Cadar and promptly received an answer.
Moreover, Cristian and Daniel Dunbar generously sent me the source code of KLEE, a new tool they were working on, even before its official release to the public.</p>
<p>In the following five years of my Ph.D. journey, I extended KLEE to execute several protocol stacks that talk to each other.
I applied this technique to test sensor networks and found a couple of interesting bugs in the Contiki OS described in my <a href="http://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/papers/2010/2010-04-ipsn-sasnauskas-KleeNet.pdf">IPSN 2010 paper</a>.
One of them caused a dead-lock of a sensor node inside the TCP/IP stack requiring a hardware reset.
It was a real bug observed in sensor network deployments.</p>
<p>I have not used KLEE actively since 2015 and was curious to give it a try (again).
Meanwhile, Contiki OS has been forked to <a href="https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng">Contiki-NG</a>.
I cloned the repo and compiled the test case called <code>20-packet-parsing</code> to LLVM bitcode.
Inside the test case, I marked the test packet buffer (~1KB) symbolic using KLEE’s <code>klee_make_symbolic</code> function.</p>
<p>After running for a couple of minutes on my old Mac, KLEE discovered two memory errors (out of bound pointers) while parsing certain protocols' headers.
I reported these findings with the concrete test cases to the security team of Contiki-NG for further analysis.
To me, this small test is yet another evidence that KLEE remains to be a useful research and test case generation tool.</p>
<h3 id="open-challenges-and-opportunities">Open Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
<p>Applying symbolic execution to arbitrary real-world programs is hard.
You often have to model the execution environment and find effective ways to cope with non-determinism and path explosion.
Moreover, many of the path constraints are difficult yet intractable to be solved in time with today’s solvers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, studying and applying symbolic execution (using KLEE) opens many opportunities.
You will learn about program structure, compilers, SAT/SMT solvers, and how to write other kinds of testing tools.
Given this bag of knowledge, I wrote tools to <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/p1-sasnauskas.pdf">fuzz Android apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/souper">superoptimize LLVM IR</a>, and more recently at work, a tool to <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2018-2665">fuzz satellite control procedures</a> written in SPELL.</p>
<p>Consider giving symbolic execution a try.
If you are a Ph.D. student and struggling to find a thesis topic in this area, <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">don’t forget the bigger picture and keep pushing</a>.</p>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page

        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.003%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.0 (0.22%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.1 (40.7%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 2 (59%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for linked resources</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.0001%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.0 (0.015%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.1 (28.8%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 2 (62.5%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (8.6%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For linked resources, HTTP 3 is about 100x more prevalent. How can this be true? Because all the sites are linking the same stuff:</p>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        
        <p id="full-di-expand"><a onclick="expandDi()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>main_doc_is_http2_or_greater (-477.53)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>jsheapusedsize_Kb (-0.02)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>redirect_count (354.27)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

					<p>“What would you say if I asked you to design me a service capable of responding to thousands of user requests every second and latency was critical?”</p><p>“Umm...that you have to solve this problem at work. But you’re out of ideas, and are looking to interviewees for suggestions”</p><p>That’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a design question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.</p><p>In the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the interview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p><p>What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out?</p><p>I tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident). Turns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do better. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.</p><p>For some reason no one talks about these aspects of interviewing, but I’ve found them helpful time and time again.</p><p>We’ll cover:</p><ul><li>Using recruiters to your advantage</li><li>Going to real interviews for practice</li><li>Being open to learning during interviews</li><li>Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</li></ul><h2 id="tip-1-use-recruiters-to-your-advantage">Tip #1: Use recruiters to your advantage</h2><p>Their voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone. “Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!” Clearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging me, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.</p><p>And they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.</p><p>Recruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the phone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be worth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an interview: Congratulations, you've already passed that bar</p><p>Now the recruiter wants to work <em>with</em> you. Their whole job is to, you know, recruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and are happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard strong candidates who can’t interview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their best selves when interviewing.</p><p><strong>How can you take advantage of this?</strong></p><p>Ask them questions! Things like:</p><ul><li>“What should I do to prepare for the interview?”</li><li>“What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the interview?”</li></ul><p>And be forthright about any problems you run into:</p><ul><li>If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask to reschedule. They want to test you when you're at your best!</li><li>Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try rescheduling. At worst they'll say "sorry, we can't do that". It will not hurt your chances of getting in</li></ul><p>Your mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.</p><h2 id="tip-2-go-to-real-interviews-for-practice">Tip #2: Go to real interviews for practice</h2><p>You need to build up your interviewing skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t come close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as possible. And don't limit yourself to the companies you care about.</p><p><strong>Learn to deal with pressure</strong></p><p>When you're in a real interview the world changes: You're locked in a cage with a lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing against the walls. Your mental gears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands struggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind every shadow. Even an innocuous "Would you like something to drink?" is a nefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?</p><p>You only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach you how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the second. But once you get a few under your belt you'll get used to the adrenaline rush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You'll become a bullfighter, confidently facing down the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.</p><p>You may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the stakes are low that lion doesn't look so fierce. I've found that I perform the best in the interviews where I don't care about the outcome. I'm much more relaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more possibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I don't really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to experience it in the low stakes games first.</p><p><strong>Learn to answer the more ambiguous questions</strong></p><p>And what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions you were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still fresh in your mind. Focus especially on the behavioral and design ones which have no clear right answer. Consider how you could have responded better. Are there stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look at them again. You’ll find better answers.</p><p>Each answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances are high that you'll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over time you'll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture highlighting how your abilities make you a valuable asset to the company.</p><p><strong>Stay open to serendipity</strong></p><p>As you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is actually interesting after all. Recruiters count on that. I’ve had recruiters suggest I interview even when I told them I didn’t find the company interesting. “Maybe you’ll change your mind after seeing us up close”, they suggest.</p><p>And I did. More than once.</p><h2 id="tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">Tip #3: Be open to learning during the interview</h2><p>I learned this one by accident, but boy does it pay off.</p><p>In a college career fair once I was walking through the booths with my bag full of swag. My eyes caught a pile of rubik’s cubes being given away by some company I'd never heard of. I wanted one! Of course I couldn't just go up and ask for it directly, so I went and chatted with the guy manning the booth. His name was Vince. A few minutes later I walked away with my prized rubik's cube in hand. That evening I got a call from Vince offering to conduct a full interview loop on campus. I already had a job offer from a company I liked, but I thought "Sure, why not? I could use the experience"</p><p>I had no intention of joining the company, they were some boring finance business. There was nothing to lose. So during the interview I felt free to ask any question I wanted. When I thought I got the answer to an interview question wrong, I'd ask "I don't think I did so great here. What's the right answer to this problem?" (I wanted to learn the answer for future interviews!). When I was asked a challenging question I could grin and delight in the problem solving aspect instead of worrying about how badly it would reflect on me. (Remember my smart aleck remark in the intro? That was this interview.)</p><p>Turns out they liked that: the next day I had a second job offer. At a significantly higher salary than my first one. Oh, and they wanted to fly me to New York in two weeks for an introduction to the company. I still didn’t want to join, but a free trip to New York? Sign me up! The company's name: Bloomberg</p><p>Bloomberg was a practiced hand at recruiting. They had a full two days of events to leave us starry eyed about the company (I came thiiiiis close to accepting their offer). While there, Vince told me I’d made a great impression by fearlessly asking questions, even when I was stumped.</p><p>Since then I’ve stopped hesitating before asking any question in an interview. Let your curiosity run free! Don’t cage it! And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.</p><h2 id="tip-4-keep-your-skills-sharp-even-when-you-re-not-job-hunting">Tip #4: Keep your skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/docjamesw">James Whittaker</a> recommends trying to get a job offer every year, just to make sure you can.</p><p>It's an extremely liberating feeling knowing that even if you lose your job you'll be able to find another one quickly. That's a huge stress off your back.</p><p>I haven't been very good about this myself, but every once in a while I'll accept an invitation from a recruiter (it helps to set up your LinkedIn account). I don't bother doing any prep for these interviews, at least not initially. Those interviews show me the areas I need to brush up on or where the industry practices are changing.</p><p>For example, in a tech screen I did last summer there was some miscommunication and I didn’t realize they expected actual working code. Instead of the usual pseudocode written in a google doc, the interviewer told me to select my language of choice on an online IDE. Now, I don't have a particular language I consider myself super proficient in. I touch many different tools at work and end up having to use a different language about every 5 months. So even basic things like "create an array" tends to require googling the syntax. Given that, what's my favorite language of choice? C#, hands down. So I selected that.</p><p>What hadn't occurred to me at the time is that C# is a very verbose language which Visual Studio beautifully automates away the tedious parts of. This online IDE automated nothing. Even for a basic task like creating an array I had to spend precious interview minutes looking up the right package to import and the exact syntax to use. Needless to say, I ran out of time. I crashed and burned there, but it opened my eyes to the way interviews are changing and how I needed to prepare in the future.</p><p>Four months later a company called Stripe reached out to me. They also expect you to write working code and even let you use your own IDE. This time I was ready. And now I work there.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="readme">
    <div>
      <pre>				    mkproof

mkproof is a small C program for generating proofs of work.

				  Installation

If mkproof is available as a package on your system, prefer to install that
rather than build it yourself.

mkproof depends only on a POSIX-like environment and a C99 compiler.

	$ ./configure
	$ make

This will produce three executables: mkchallenge, mkproof, and checkproof.

				     Usage

The situation: Bob wants Alice to do something, but Alice isn't sure if Bob is a
robot.

1. Alice runs `mkchallenge` and sends the challenge to Bob.
2. Bob runs `mkproof &lt;challenge&gt;` and wastes some CPU time. After several
   minutes of work, a proof is printed to stdout.
3. Bob sends the proof to Alice.
4. Alice runs `checkproof &lt;challenge&gt; &lt;proof&gt;` to verify the work.

Now Alice can be reasonably confident that Bob is not a robot, and proceed with
Bob's request.

				   Algorithm

To make a challenge, generate 16 random bytes. Choose the argon2 iterations and
memory parameters, and the number of zeroed digits, to tune the difficulty. The
challenge string is the terms "argon2id"; the iterations, memory use, and number
of digits which shall be zero, as decimal integers; and the random bytes as
hexadecimal; joining the terms with ":".

To make a proof, split the challenge by ":" and verify that the first token is
"argon2id". Decode the iterations, memory, and digits parameters, and the
challenge bytes.

Repeat the following algorithm to generate proofs until an argon2id key
is found whose first N bits are zero, where N is equal to the digits
parameter:

1. Generate 16 random bytes (password).
2. Run argon2id with the generated password, and the memory and iteration
   parameters provided by the challenge, and the challenge bytes as the salt.
   The hash length and parallelism parameters shall be respectively set to 32
   and 1.
3. Encode the argon2id hash as hexadecimal.

When a suitable hash is found, encode the password in hexadecimal. This is the
proof which should be transmitted to the challenger.

To verify the proof, simply run the proof algorithm with the original challenge
parameters and the challengee's provided password and verify that the resulting
hexadecimal string is prefixed with the appropriate number of zeroes.

				     Notes

The defaults are tuned to take about five minutes on one core of a modern
consumer CPU.

  <p>One Hundred Sixteen Billion: that’s the number of times our test code read Firestore database in less than an hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post is Part 2 in the series. If you haven’t already, go through <strong><a href="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/72k-1/">Part 1</a></strong> first so this one makes sense :)</p>

<h3 id="standing-himalaya-is-telling-us">Standing Himalaya is telling us…</h3>
<p>This was the first time that I had received such a big set back. It had the potential to alter the course of our company and my life. There were several lessons on entrepreneurship in this incident, one important one was to stay strong.</p>

<p>I had a team of ~7 engineers/interns at this time, and it would take Google about 10 days to get back to us on this incident. In the meantime we had to resume development, find our way around account suspensions. Despite this thought on my mind, we had to focus on the features and our product.</p>

<em>Poem: Khada Himalaya bata raha hai (Standing Himalaya is telling us)
</em></a>
</center>

<p>For some reason one poem from my childhood kept playing in my head. It was my favorite one, and I remembered it word to word, even though the last time I recited it was over 15 years ago.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-we-actually-do">What did we actually do?</h3>
<p>As a very small team, we wanted to stay serverless for as long as we could. The problem with serverless solutions like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run was timeout.</p>

<p>One instance at any time would be serially scraping the URLs in a web page. But soon after 9 minutes, it would time out.</p>

<p>After discussing this problem, and powered with caffiene, within minutes I wrote some dry code on the white board which I now see had so many design issues, but back then, we were focused more on failing and learning super fast and trying new things.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/whiteboard.jpg" width="100%"><br>
<em>Announce-AI's 'Hello World' version on Cloud Run</em>
</center>

<p>To overcome the timeout limitation, I suggested using POST requests (with URL as data) to send jobs to an instance, and use multiple instances in parallel instead of using one instance serially. Because each instance in Cloud Run would only be scraping one page, it would never time out, process all pages in parallel (scale), and also be highly optimized because Cloud Run usage is accurate to milliseconds.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/flowchart.jpg" width="100%"><br>
<em>Scraper deployed on Cloud Run</em>
</center>

<p>If you look closely, the flow is missing few important pieces.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Exponential Recursion without Break: The instances wouldn’t know when to break, as there was no break statement.</li>
  <li>The POST requests could be of the same URLs. If there’s a back link to the previous page, the Cloud Run service will be stuck in infinite recursion, but what’s worst is, that this recursion is multiplying exponentially (our max instances were set to 1000!)</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can imagine, this lead to 1000 instances querying, and writing to Firebase DB every few milli seconds. Looking at the data post incident, we saw that the Firebase Reads were at one point about 1 Billion Requests per minute!</p>

<center>

<em>End of month Transaction Summary for GCP Billing Account</em>
</center>

<h3 id="116-billion-reads-and-33-million-writes">116 Billion Reads and 33 Million Writes</h3>
<p>Running our this version of Hello World deployment on Cloud Run, made 116 Billion reads and 33 Million Writes to Firestore. Ouch!</p>

<p>Read Operations Cost on Firebase:</p>

<p><strong>$ (0.06 / 100,000) * 116,000,000,000 = $ 69,600</strong></p>

<h3 id="16000-hours-of-cloud-run-compute-time">16,000 hours of Cloud Run Compute time</h3>
<p>After testing, we assumed that the request died because logging stopped, but actually it went into background process. As we didn’t delete the services (this was our first time using Cloud Run, and we didn’t really understand it back then), multiple services continued to operate slowly.</p>

<p>In 24 hours, these service versions each scaled to 1000 instances consumed <strong>16,022 hours.</strong></p>

<h2 id="all-our-mistakes">All our Mistakes</h2>
<h4 id="deploying-flawed-algorithm-on-cloud">Deploying flawed algorithm on Cloud</h4>
<p>Already discussed above. We did discover a new way to use serverless using POST requests, something I hadn’t found anywhere on the internet, but deployed it without refining the algorithm.</p>

<h4 id="deploying-cloud-run-with-default-options">Deploying Cloud Run with Default Options</h4>
<p>While creating a Cloud Run service, we chose default values in the service. The max-instances is preset to 1000, and concurrency set to 80. In the beginning we didn’t know that these values are actually worst case scenario for a test program.</p>

<p>Had we chosen max-instances to be “2”, our costs would’ve been 500 times less. <strong>$72,000 bill would’ve been: $144</strong></p>

<p>Had we chosen concurrency of “1” request, we probably wouldn’t have even noticed the bill.</p>

<h4 id="using-firebase-without-understanding-it-completely">Using Firebase without understanding it completely</h4>
<p>There are somethings that can only be learnt after lot of experience. Firebase isn’t a language that one can learn, it’s a containerized platform service provided by Google. It has rules defined by them, not by laws of nature or how a particular user may think they are.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/firebase.png" width="60%">
</center>

<p>Also, while writing code in Node.js, one must take care of Background processes. If the code goes into background processes, there’s no easy way for the developer to know that the service is running, but it might be, for fairly long time. As we learnt later on, this was the reason why most of our Cloud Functions were timing out as well.</p>

<h4 id="fail-fast-learn-fast-with-cloud-is-a-bad-idea">Fail fast, learn fast with Cloud is a bad idea</h4>
<p>Cloud overall is like a double edged sword. When used properly, it can be of great use, but if used incorrectly, it can have consequences.</p>

<p>If you count the number of pages in GCP documentation, it’s probably more than pages in few novels. Understanding Pricing, Usage, is not only time consuming, but requires a deep understanding of how Cloud services work. No wonder there are full time jobs for just this purpose!</p>

<h4 id="firebase-and-cloud-run-are-really-powerful">Firebase, and Cloud Run are really powerful</h4>
<p>At the peak, Firebase was able to handle about one billion reads per minute. This is exceptionally powerful. We had been playing around with Firebase for 2-3 months now and still learning about it, but I had absolutely no idea how powerful it was until now.</p>

<p>Same goes with Cloud Run! With Concurrency == 60, max_containers == 1000 and each Request taking 400ms, number of requests Cloud Run can handle <strong>9 million requests per minute!</strong></p>

<h4 id="60--1000--25--60--9000000-requests--minute">60 * 1000 * 2.5 * 60 = 9,000,000 requests / minute</h4>

<p>For comparison, Google Search gets 3.8 million searches per minute.</p>

<h4 id="edit-use-cloud-monitoring">(EDIT): Use Cloud Monitoring</h4>
<p>While <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring">Google Cloud Monitoring</a> doesn’t stop the billing, it does send timely alerts (lag of about 3-4 minutes). There’s a learning curve in understanding Google Cloud’s proto / naming structure, but once you spend time with it, the dashboards, alerts and metrics make the life a little easier.</p>

<p>These metrics are only availabe for 90 days, and we’ve lost the metrics from this incident (there was a huge bump in Firebase and Cloud Run usage for those days), otherwise I’d be happy to share them in this post.</p>

<h2 id="we-survived">We Survived</h2>
<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/phew.gif" width="100%">
<em>Phew, that was close</em>
</center>

<p>After going through our lengthy doc on this incident sharing our side of the story, various consults, talks, and internal discussions Google let go of our bill as a one time gesture!</p>

<p><strong>Thank you Google!</strong></p>

<p>We got our lifeline, and got back on both our feet to build Announce. Except this time with a much better perspective, architecture, and much safer implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google, my favorite tech company, is not just a great company to work for. It’s also a great company to collaborate with. The tools provided by Google are very developer friendly, have a great documentation (for the most part), and are consistently expanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(EDIT: these are my - the author’s personal opinions as an individual developer. Our company is in no way sponsored, or related with Google).</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>
<p>After this incident, we spent few months on understanding Cloud and our architecture. In few weeks my understanding improved so much that I approximated the cost of scraping the “entire web” using Cloud Run with improved algorithm.</p>

<p>This incident led me to analyze our product’s architecture in depth, and we scrapped V1 of our product, to build scalable infrastructure to power our products.</p>

<p>In Announce V2, we didn’t just build an MVP; we built a platform where we could iteratively develop new products rapidly, and test them thoroughly in a safe environment.</p>

<p>This journey took us some time… <a href="https://annc.in/">Announce</a> was launched in November end, ~7 months later than we had decided for our V1, but it is highly scalable, gets the best of Cloud services, and is highly optimized for usage.</p>

<p>We also launched on all platforms, and not just web.</p>

<p>What’s more is that we reused the entire platform to build our second product <a href="https://pointaddress.com/">Point Address</a>. Not only are both the products scalable, have a great architecture, and highly efficient, they are built on a platform that allows us to rapidly build and deploy ideas into useable products.</p>

His simple "<a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2013/08/post-office-2nd-sight-report-into.html" target="_blank">Yes, of course</a>" by way of response was unequivocal.</p><p>We stayed in touch. I read some of his work, including his <a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2015/11/barrister-criticises-post-office.html" target="_blank">clear view of where the court was wrong</a> in the prosecution of Seema Misra, the West Byfleet Postmaster sent to prison whilst pregnant.</p><p>Mr Mason's central argument is that a recommendation given by the Law Commission in 1997 to the courts is helplesssly, hopelessly and dangerously wrong. <a href="https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/article/view/5143/5027" target="_blank">The guidance states</a>:</p><blockquote>"in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the courts will presume that&nbsp;mechanical instruments were in order at the material time...&nbsp;<i>The principle has been applied to such devices as speedometers and traffic lights and in the consultation paper we saw no reason why it should not apply to computers.</i>" [my italics]</blockquote><p>You don't need to be a legal eagle or IT genius to see that the Law Commission's decision to leap from a speedometer to the vastly complex digital ecosystems underpinning modern computer networks is mutton-headed, to say the least.</p><p>Yet it is this presumption the courts have relied on throughout the 21st century in the prosecutions of Subpostmasters and unfortunate individuals in other spheres, who were, it turns out, entirely innocent.</p><p>Mr Mason has been attempting to get the legal position on computers changed for as long as I can remember.

That is to say, they have a latent propensity to function incorrectly."</blockquote><p>As a general rule of thumb:</p><blockquote>"A program on a mobile telephone might hitherto have contained tens of thousands of lines of software code. A program such as Horizon will contain tens of millions of lines of code, and will be exceedingly complex. Programming is a human task and programmers make mistakes; an error rate in writing software code of 10 errors per thousand lines of code&nbsp;is considered good, 1 error per thousand lines is rarely if ever achieved."</blockquote><p>By way of example the paper cites a 2006 University of York review of a study conducted by the Ministry of Defence into the safety of the software contained in its Hercules C130J air transporters. The MoD found that the Hercules software contained about 1.4 safety-critical faults per thousand lines of code (kLoC) with an overall flaw density of around 23 per kLoC</p><p>The review notes:</p><blockquote>"whilst a fault density of 1 per kLoC may seem high it is worth noting that commercial software is around 30 faults per kLoC, with initial fault injection rates of over 100 per kLoC."</blockquote><p>Mr Mason et al's clear recommendations for a protocol on the way electronic evidence is treated by the legal system&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/article/view/5240/5083" target="_blank">can be read here</a>. They seem eminently sensible.</p><p>*****************</p><p>If you are able to give £20 or more you will be added to the secret email list.

<p><strong>In cell culture,
loperamide, a drug commonly used against diarrhoea, proves effective against
glioblastoma cells. A research team at Goethe University has now unravelled the
drug’s mechanisms &nbsp;of action of cell
death induction and – in doing so – has shown how this compound could help attack
brain tumours that otherwise are difficult to treat.</strong></p>



<p>The research group led by Dr Sjoerd van Wijk from the Institute of Experimental Cancer Research in Paediatrics at Goethe University already two years ago found evidence indicating that the anti-diarrhoea drug loperamide could be used to induce cell death in glioblastoma cell lines. They have now deciphered its mechanism of action and, in doing so, are opening new avenues for the development of novel treatment strategies.</p>







<h3><strong>When cells digest themselves</strong></h3>



<p>In certain types of tumour cells, administration
of loperamide leads to a stress response in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the
cell organelle responsible for key steps in protein synthesis in the body. The
stress in the ER triggers its degradation, followed by self-destruction of the
cells. This mechanism, known as autophagy-dependent cell death occurs when
cells undergo hyperactivated autophagy. Normally, autophagy regulates normal
metabolic processes and breaks down and recycles the valuable parts of damaged
or superfluous cell components thus ensuring the cell’s survival, for example
in the case of nutrient deficiency. In certain tumour cells, however, hyperactivation
of autophagy destroys so much cell material that they are no longer capable of
surviving.</p>



<p>“Our experiments with cell lines show that
autophagy could support the treatment of glioblastoma brain tumours,” says van
Wijk. Glioblastoma is a very aggressive and lethal type of cancer in children
and adults that shows only a poor response to chemotherapy. New therapeutic
approaches are therefore urgently required. The research group led by van Wijk
has now identified an important factor that links the ER stress response with
the degradation of the ER (reticulophagy):&nbsp;
The “Activating Transcription Factor” ATF4 is
produced in increased amounts both during ER stress and under the influence of
loperamide. It triggers the destruction of the ER membranes and thus of the ER.</p>







<h3><strong>Anti-diarrhoea drug
triggers cell death in glioblastoma cells</strong></h3>



<p>“Conversely, if we block ATF4, far fewer
cells in a tumour cell culture die after adding loperamide,” says van Wijk,
describing the control results. In addition, the research group was able to detect
ER debris in loperamide-treated cells under the electron microscope. “ER
degradation, that is, reticulophagy, visibly contributes to the demise of
glioblastoma cells,” says van Wijk. The team also showed that loperamide triggers
only autophagy but not cell death in other cells, such as embryonic mouse
fibroblasts. “Normally, loperamide, when taken as a remedy against diarrhoea,
binds to particular binding sites in the intestine and is not taken up by the
bowel and is therefore harmless”.</p>







<h3><strong>Mechanism of action
also applicable to other diseases</strong></h3>



<p>The loperamide-induced death of
glioblastoma cells could help in the development of new therapeutic approaches
for the treatment of this severe form of cancer. “However, our findings also
open up exciting new possibilities for the treatment of other diseases where ER
degradation is disrupted, such as neurological disorders or dementia as well as
other types of tumour,” says van Wijk. However, further studies are necessary before
loperamide can actually be used in the treatment of glioblastoma or other
diseases. In future studies it has to be explored, for example, how loperamide
can be transported into the brain and cross the blood-brain barrier.
Nanoparticles might be a feasible option. The research team in Frankfurt now wants
to identify other substances that trigger reticulophagy and examine how the
effect of loperamide can be increased and better understood.</p>



<p>The research group led by Sjoerd van Wijk
is funded by the Frankfurt Foundation for Children with Cancer (<em>Frankfurter
Stiftung für krebskranke Kinder</em>) and the Collaborative Research Centre 1177
“Molecular and Functional Characterisation of Selective Autophagy” funded by
the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft). The work is
the result of collaboration with Dr Muriel Mari and Professor Fulvio Reggiori
(University of Groningen, The Netherlands) and Professor Donat Kögel
(Experimental Neurosurgery, Goethe University).</p>

<p><span>A</span>yushi Sahu was ambushed. One evening in 2018, five months after her wedding, the 21-year-old college student was visiting her parents in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, when her husband showed up unannounced, his father and uncle in tow.</p>



<p>As the men settled in the living room, her husband said he had something he wanted them to hear. He took out his mobile phone and pressed “play.” The audio was loud and clear: private conversations between Sahu and her friends and family,<strong> </strong>which had been recorded without her permission. And it wasn’t only audio: “call logs, SMS, and WhatsApp messages, each photo and video, recordings of my video calls — he claimed to have accessed everything,” Sahu said. That was when she realized that her husband had, for months, been spying on her.</p>



<p>This was also how Sahu learned of certain things he had been holding against her. (Her name has been changed to protect against retaliation.) He had been offended to hear her complaining to her mother about problems with her in-laws. And he objected to her talking to a male friend. “He made a scene as if he was ‘exposing’ me,” Sahu recalled. “I was just sharing my concerns. That’s normal.”</p>



<p>Her husband played several more recordings, until his father eventually intervened. “I don’t want to listen to any more of this. You have heard it all? Okay, then,” he said, before reaching out to comfort Sahu, who was still in shock.</p>



<p>After processing the experience, Sahu decided she was willing to shrug it off, apologize, and move on, but her new husband continued to behave strangely. Eventually, she felt she had no choice but to end the marriage. “I don’t understand why he had to take this spying route,” she reflected. “He could have just asked. You know, in India, men can scold their wives, right? He could have done that. What was the need to go so deep into my phone and record my conversations?”</p>



<p>Sahu has no idea how her phone was bugged or for how long she was surveilled. But she has one clue: Her Vivo smartphone was an engagement gift from her husband.</p>



<p>It is likely that Sahu’s phone had off-the-shelf spyware on it. Her husband may have installed it himself or even consulted a private detective before marrying her, who provided him with the phone. In either case, he would have been part of a growing trend of individuals — often, jealous lovers — making use of personal surveillance technology.</p>



<p>According to Kunwar Vikram Singh, the chairman of the Association of Private Detectives and Investigators in India, it’s now common for wealthy families to assess the suitability of a potential bride or groom by hiring a private detective, a vetting that usually costs around $500. He attributes this to India’s changing social mores, especially among urban elites. “Work culture has changed. Values have changed,” Singh reflected, citing the influx of women into the workforce as one contributing factor. “We tell people, ‘You spend lakhs and crores on marital ceremonies; spend a few thousand on investigators’,” he said.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, India’s private-detective services have been growing over the past decade. Singh estimates that the sector is now worth roughly $1.2 billion<strong> </strong>nationally. But because of the sensitive nature of the field, it’s impossible to know for sure: There are no official statistics, and many clients still pay in cash. “They don’t want to leave any footprint,” he noted.</p>



<p>The services offered by the detectives mainly fall into two categories: corporate and personal. The corporate investigations often involve banks hiring investigators to get information on shifty borrowers and financial firms looking for background checks on employees. The personal services range from child monitoring to matrimonial background checks. Every agency has its own specialization. Karnam Choudhary, a Jaipur-based detective who operates the Siyol Detective Network, which has around 1,500 freelance private investigators across the country, says that “since 2016, personal cases make up almost 70%.”</p>



<p>The boom in business has coincided with a growing reliance on consumer-grade spyware. These are mostly smartphone apps that cannot easily be detected, secretly record all of a device’s activity, and route that data to a third-party dashboard. A private investigator’s first move used to be shadowing somebody in person; today, many of them begin by advising the client to present the object of their suspicion with a malware-infected smartphone.</p>



<p>Growing demand for spyware first caught the attention of India’s software engineers several years ago, long before the coronavirus pandemic led to a spike. In 2013, while researching viruses and cybersecurity for his final-year engineering project, Gujarat-based coder Tushar Mepani began meeting parents who wanted to keep closer tabs on their teenagers’ whereabouts. “I could not sleep at night when these millionaires told me about their kids’ behavior,” he said, apparently in earnest. The initial prototype of <a href="http://www.convants.com/">what became his first app for tracking children</a>, EasySpyPhone, was restricted to recording calls and collecting text messages and location data, but more recent iterations can spy on social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, secretly turn on a phone’s microphone to record calls and video, and capture screenshots, all for around $20 or $40 per month. “Parents were very happy,” Mepani reflected. “They learned who their kids are friends with — and who is diverting them. The app has saved kids from being spoiled.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had no idea at the time whether people would be interested in this, but it clicked with users.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Mepani doesn’t sell only one or two products, however; through his Android spyware company, Convants Information Security, he licenses surveillance software to multiple vendors, who repackage it under different names. He won’t reveal the details of these arrangements, calling them “internal business,” but he claims to have made more than 20,000 sales. In 2014, Choudhary, the Jaipur-based detective, used Mepani’s software to launch his <a href="http://spymobileprocess.com/">agency’s own app, Spy Mobile Process</a>. Instead of paying for a full investigation, those who buy Choudhary’s app may use it to conduct their own inquiries, with guidance from detectives. “We had no idea at the time whether people would be interested in this,” he said. “But it clicked with users.”</p>



<p>All of this exists in a legal gray area. As of now, there are no laws in India regulating the selling or purchasing of so-called stalkerware. Nor is there much clarity about the privacy laws currently on the books. In India, it is not illegal to physically surveil a target, for instance, but things get fuzzier when it comes to tracking somebody’s location via mobile phone. Courts have been forced to establish statutes, case by case. In 2018, for instance, a family court in Delhi <a href="https://theprint.in/judiciary/evidence-collected-in-breach-of-privacy-does-not-make-it-inadmissible-in-court-delhi-hc/452288/">admitted evidence collected from spyware</a> in a case concerning a marital dispute, stating that the right to a fair trial outweighed privacy protections.</p>



<p>But staying on the right side of the law doesn’t seem to trouble many spyware vendors. Insofar as they are concerned about legal exposure, most will simply add disclaimers that place the onus on the user. Before installing software, the customer should get “proper written consent to do so by the owner of the smartphone” and understand that it is the “responsibility of the buyer to obey all laws of their country.”</p>



<p>In August 2020, Google introduced a new Ads Policy imposing restrictions on advertising for spyware and surveillance technology. “The updated policy will prohibit the promotion of products or services that are marketed or targeted with the express purpose of tracking or monitoring another person or their activities without their authorization,” the company wrote in its updated policy. However, Google made two exceptions: “private investigation services,” like Choudhary’s, and “products or services designed for parents to track or monitor their underage children,” like Mepani’s.</p>



<p>Private detectives who admit to using spyware almost universally insist that any problems stemming from it are the result of abuse. But what they say publicly is one thing, and how they market their services is another. While Choudhary claims his app is not intended for spying on spouses, a <a href="https://twitter.com/Siyol007/status/670517689576726528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2FSahil-Chajotra-JK-detectives-0f27a3d4a117474eac2b15f591b5d764">November 2015 tweet</a> from his company’s official account said just the opposite. In a series of phone interviews, Mepani also denied marketing his product to jealous husbands and wives, even as his website made clear that these are target demographics. “But you know,” he added, “it is like a knife. You can cut fruits, or you can cut someone’s head.”</p>



<p>However unsettling, the spyware sector is only one small part of a much vaster infrastructure. More than 500 million people in India use the internet every month, creating troves of private information with every click, scroll, swipe, and download. What they watch, how they date, whom they work for, and where they spend their money is constantly being captured and monetized. All this has given rise to a multimillion-dollar dark data economy, in which no piece of information is too personal to trade.</p>

<p><strong>The black market</strong> for data, as it exists online in India, resembles those for wholesale vegetables or smuggled goods. Customers are encouraged to buy in bulk, and the variety of what’s on offer is mind-boggling: There are databases about parents, cable customers, pregnant women, pizza eaters, mutual funds investors, and almost any niche group one can imagine. A typical database consists of a spreadsheet with row after row of names and key details: Sheila Gupta, 35, lives in Kolkata, runs a travel agency, and owns a BMW; Irfaan Khan, 52, lives in Greater Noida, and has a son who just applied to engineering college. The databases are usually updated every three months (the older one is, the less it is worth), and if you buy several at the same time, …</p></div></div>

                  <p>As the sun sets, Tim Bishop walks out the front door of his lodge in his trusted flannel work shirt and worn-in snow boots. On frigid nights, he wears thermals under his jeans. Surrounded by the Snowy Range mountains, Bishop carries a warm dinner made by his wife, a Thermos of hot coffee, and water and snacks to last him through the night. One of his two Australian shepherds follows him through the snow to the Tucker Sno-Cat as he embarks on his long night on the trails.</p>

          <div>

            <p>“When I’m out there, and the moon is up, it’s just gorgeous. […] I’m out there by myself, and I’m at home.”</p>
                        </div>
        
      
    
      

                  <p><span>Bishop works as a snow groomer five nights a week during the depths of Wyoming winters, typically from December through March. He is one of three snow groomers in Medicine Bow, Wyoming. Each night of the week they groom the hundreds of miles of trails in Medicine Bow National Forest from sundown until the wee hours of the morning.</span></p>
      

            
    
      

            
        

      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p><span>Tourism is the second-largest industry in Wyoming, and snowmobiling is a significant attraction. Snowmobilers purchase permits from the state each year to sled Medicine Bow National Forest’s trails. After a full day of </span><span>snowmobiles passing over them</span><span>, the trails become rough and require smoothing for the safety and enjoyment of the sledders. Bishop says the state needed someone who lived in the area, was familiar with Medicine Bow National Forest, and could operate big pieces of machinery to work the trails.</span></p>
<p><span>“The snowmobilers want a nice trail to go down,” Bishop says. “I will groom, and the snow will be hard. If I don’t groom it, the snow will get these big ruts, and nobody wants to go down them. It’s more dangerous, it tears the snowmobile up, and it is not as enjoyable.”</span></p>

      </div>

                  <p>The snow groomer looms over the icy landscape with its six-metre frame, including a 1.2 m pan and a heated cab. The machine creates an even surface through a process of warming and moving the snow, with the pan smoothing it out at the end. Precariously teetering along narrow strips of land with cliffs on either side requires a balance of artistry and surgical precision. Bishop fluidly manoeuvres the 3.6 m blades across the wild topography, despite the laborious task.</p>

          <div>

            <p>“In some parts of the trail, you can’t go more than four to five miles [six to eight kilometres] an hour,” Bishop says. The longest trail Bishop grooms is 132 km, and takes him 10 to 14 hours to complete.</p>
                        </div>
        
      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p><span>To become a groomer, Bishop enrolled in a week-long intensive training to learn the basics of the craft. However, like all arts, snow grooming is best learned through practice. Bishop has perfected his approach over the last two years, continuing to learn various nuances of the job.</span></p>
<p><span>“I know the trails,” Bishop says. “It was just a matter of learning to drive the groomer.”</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Bishop knows the terrain intimately, snow grooming can be dangerous. Furious blizzards, whiteouts, 120 km/h winds, and temperatures dropping to -30 </span><b>°</b><span>C are all commonplace on the trails. Bishop says the nights can test your steel as you drive over frozen rivers with water flowing beneath the ice, stare into the green eyes of a stubborn moose, or see mountain lions shred a deer to pieces.</span></p>

      </div>

                  <div>
        <p>“If you break down, you spend the night or you walk out,” Bishop says. “Normally, you don’t want to leave the snowcat because if you turn it off, you may not get it cranked again up there.”</p>
<p>Bishop says the trails also need to be maintained for search and rescue purposes: “If we don’t have trails groomed to get to those places that people get hurt, we can’t get to them.” While he isn’t on the search and rescue team himself, Bishop says he has pulled a stuck vehicle out of a snowbank and picked up stranded snowmobilers and brought them to safety.</p>

            <p>The nights when Bishop is bathed in the luminous glow of the moon and stars are his favourites. On top of the mental exercise of navigating the snow groomer through the unmarked trails, he listens to audiobooks to pass the time.</p>

        <p>“I learn a lot while I’m up there,” he says.</p>
<p>While the solitary work can be lonely, Bishop is never truly alone. Each night he alternates bringing one of his dogs, Roper and Magnum, leaving the other with his wife at their lodge. This ride-along tradition was actually not originally Bishop’s idea. The first time he went grooming, Roper and Magnum trailed their owner across the frozen landscape.</p>
<p>“I just happened to be turning around and found them [the dogs]. I didn’t know they were following me. They went 50 km before I picked them up. If I hadn’t found them where I did, they would have had to go 100 km,” Bishop says, laughing. “They were so sore; they could hardly walk the next day. They are much happier in the cab.”</p>

They run Medicine Bow Lodge &amp; Adventure Guest Ranch, which accepts visitors during the spring, summer, and fall. As Bishop prepares his lodges for the winter, he gears up to groom the trails. Bishop says he enjoys the peace of the winter after a busy guest season.</span></p>
<p><span>“In the summer, I’m with people from 6 o’clock in the morning to 8 or 9 o’clock at night, seven days a week, from the end of May to the end of October,” he says. “In the winter, it’s a nice break. I’m not with people. It’s quiet. I can think. I can listen to books. It’s a whole different experience for me.”</span></p>

    <p>Matrix is an instant messaging system similar to Whatsapp or Telegram, but
uses an open and decentralized network for secure and privacy-protected
communications. NeoChat is a visually attractive Matrix client that works on
desktop computers and mobile phones.</p>
<h2 id="convergence">Convergence</h2>
<p>NeoChat provides an elegant and convergent user interface, allowing
it to adapt to any screen size automatically and gracefully.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plasma-mobile.org/img/post-2020-11/neochat-drawer.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>This means you can use it both on desktop computers, where you might want to
have a small bar on the side of your screen, but you can also enjoy NeoChat
on Plasma Mobile and Android phones.</p>
<p>In fact, NeoChat will be installed by default on the PinePhone KDE edition and
we offer a <a href="https://binary-factory.kde.org/view/Android/job/Neochat_android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nightly Android
version</a>
too. The Android version is for the moment experimental and some
features, like file uploading, don’t work yet.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>NeoChat provides a timeline with support for simple messages and also allows
you to upload images and video and audio files. You can reply to messages and
add reactions.</p>
<p>NeoChat provides all the basic features chat application needs: apart from
sending and responding to messages, you can invite users to a room, start
private chats, create new rooms and explore public rooms.</p>

<p>A lot of care has been put into making NeoChat intuitive to use. For
example, copying with Ctrl+C and dragging and dropping images just work; and
the text field gets autofocused so that you are never writing into the void.
NeoChat also integrates an emoji picker, letting you use the greatest invention
of the <del>21st century</del>. (Note: someone in Mastodon pointed out that
Emojis are from the 20th century and appeared in 1997 in Japan.)</p>
<h2 id="image-editor">Image Editor</h2>
<p>NeoChat also includes a basic image editor that lets you crop and rotate
images before sending them. The image editor is provided by a small library
called KQuickImageEditor.</p>

<p>This library for the moment doesn’t have a stable API and is released together
with NeoChat.</p>
<h2 id="why-matrix-and-neochat">Why Matrix and NeoChat</h2>
<p>Matrix is an open network for secure and decentralized communication. This is an
initiative that is very much aligned with KDE’s goals of creating an open
operating system for everybody. This is why we need a Matrix client that
integrates into Plasma and thus NeoChat was born.</p>
<p>NeoChat is a fork of Spectral, another QML client, and uses the
libQuotient library to interact with the Matrix protocol. We would like to send
out a huge thank you to these two projects and their contributors. Without
them, NeoChat wouldn’t have been possible.</p>
<p>NeoChat uses the <a href="https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirigami framework</a>
and QML to provide an elegant and convergent user interface.</p>
<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>NeoChat is fully translated in English, Ukrainian, Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese,
Hungarian, French, Dutch, Catalan (Valencian), Catalan, British English,
Italian, Norwegian Nynorsk and Slovenian. Thanks a lot to all the translators
and if NeoChat is not available in your native language consider joining <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE
localization team</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-missing">What is Missing</h2>
<p>For the moment, encryption support is missing and NeoChat doesn’t support video
calls and editing messages yet either. Both things are in the works.</p>
<p>We are also missing some integration with the rest of the KDE applications,<br>
like with <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/purpose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purpose</a>, which will
allow NeoChat to be used to share content from other KDE applications; and
with <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/sonnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonnet</a>, which will provide
spellchecking features.</p>
<p>The fastest way to implement these deficiencies is to get involved! The
NeoChat team is a friendly group of developers and Matrix enthusiasts. Join us
and help us make NeoChat a great Matrix client! You can join us at
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#neochat:kde.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#neochat:kde.org</a>. We also participate
to Season of KDE, so if you want to get mentored on a project and at the end
get a cool KDE T-Shirt, feel free to say hi.</p>
<h2 id="tarballs">Tarballs</h2>
<p>Unfortunally there was an error generating the tarbals, we are working on it
and new tarbals will be created shortly.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of NeoChat is availabe <a href="https://download.kde.org/stable/neochat/1.0/neochat-1.0.tar.xz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>,
kquickimageeditor 0.1.2 is availabe <a href="https://download.kde.org/stable/kquickimageeditor/0.1/kquickimageeditor-0.1.2.tar.xz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
Both packages are signed with my gpg key <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/gpg.html">14B0ED91B5783415D0AA1E0A06B35D38387B67BE</a>.</p>
<p>A Flathub release will hopefully be released in the next few days. We will
update this post when it is available.</p>

The only way to do it was by checking the domain of their emails used during registration. Yes, this is not 100% accurate. Not all people use company emails in open source. It is visible in data; half of the users have the <strong>gmail.com</strong> domain. Nevertheless, the result of my investigation is pretty accurate with our knowledge. The ones that have more than three representants:</p><ul><li>mulesoft.com</li><li>postman.com</li><li>redhat.com</li><li>sap.com</li><li>smartbear.com</li><li>solace.com</li><li>tibco.com</li><li>worldpay.com</li></ul><p><undefined>Some of these companies sponsored our work in 2020.

We won't be able to compare this year with the previous one because... this is not a place where I want to discuss the experience you get with LinkedIn.</p><h3 id="followers-and-impressions">Followers and impressions</h3><p>At the moment, we have 757 followers.</p><div><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Followers</td><td>Likes</td><td>Impressions</td></tr><tr><td>611<br>57 from payed marketing</td><td>1253</td><td>80095</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><p>People that like our updates are most likely the ones that click on links. 75% (947) of likes converted into visits to our <a href="http://asyncapi.com/">website</a>. We took this data from Google Analytics, and we know that in 2019 we had only 137 visits from LinkedIn.</p><p>The most performing update was the one about the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6742099578591481856">partnership with Postman</a>. It is LinkedIn, and it is all about business.</p><p>The chart below shows that data match reality. The highest peak in late March is related to our first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMSzGc5bDr4">AsyncAPI Online Conference</a>. The rise of sponsored traffic is connected to our post-conference activities using the money we got from conference sponsors.</p><figure><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/2020-summary/linkedin-impressions.webp"><p>Figure 2: Impressions to updates in 2020</p></figure><p>This year we explored paid adverts on LinkedIn. We had some money left from sponsors of our AsyncAPI conference but zero experience with LinkedIn.</p><p>Luckily, we have a fantastic community. One of the community members, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-weese-53b27410/">Dan Weese</a>, helped us here. He did not only put us in contact with marketing expert, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sardou/">Charles Serdou</a><undefined> but also covered his wages.

Comparing the results of sponsored marketing with followers' organic growth, one could say LinkedIn marketing was not so good. It was very good though. LinkedIn is just super expensive and charged a lot for every new follower.</p><p>We should give it a second chance in 2021, but this time with sponsored updates.</p><h3 id="whats-next-with-linkedin">What's next with LinkedIn</h3><p>The numbers show it is worth investing in the channel. We can reach a lot of people that are not reachable on other channels. So we will for sure continue what we do now, especially that this work doesn't require too much extra effort from us.</p><p>I feel that probably some traffic coming from LinkedIn to our website is not adequately tracked in Google Analytics. Data from LinkedIn say we should notice 2x947 traffic. It might be related to people blocking tracking tools, and we will have to make sure to use other tracking methods, like putting identifiers in the links.</p><h2 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h2><p>We use Google Analytics on <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI website</a> because we want to understand what content is most valuable for you, and we want to learn how the interest is growing. </p><h3 id="traffic-got-much-higher">Traffic got much higher</h3><p>The interest is growing by a lot!

We use it to share updates, short information and engage directly with our community members. We should continue to work on organic growth. It converted only into 2 160 sessions to the AsyncAPI website, which is not much if we compare it with 2 283 sessions opened with the AsyncAPI Conference website using promoted content.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-12-23">December 23, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few weeks ago, we wrote a massively successful <a href="#">IMGZ systems architecture article</a> that ended up going viral (note to editor: are we still allowed to say "viral" in 2020?) and upending the world of image hosting.
Here we were, a small newcomer, poised to take on the giants of the multi-billion-dollar image hosting industry with our new, innovative and daring business model of charging people for services.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, all the media attention caused our user count to skyrocket, and our subscription graph started exhibiting the familiar "hockey stick" pattern that every VC in Silicon Valley wants to be hit with:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/iQYRKWrE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, such an influx of new users caused a deluge of new content being uploaded to the platform. We estimate that, with our current level of usage, up to a thousand images could be getting uploaded to the service every year.</p>
<p>Naturally, we immediately sprang into action to preserve the reliability of our infrastructure, and quickly drew up a scaling plan that would enable the service to withstand its newfound popularity. This is where our foresight when designing the service paid off, as the hosting provider we use let us quickly perform the necessary changes and provision an extra gigabyte of disk space.</p>
<h2>One thing becomes clear</h2>
<p>However, one thing became clear: We could not sustain this breakneck pace for long by ourselves. This was never more obvious than a few days ago, when we realized we were close to failing to meet our uptime guarantee for 2020, and had to take the service offline for a few days to bring our uptime down to what we promised.</p>
<p>This event highlighted that there is just too much to do in a fledgling startup that aims to become the next MySpace, and even more to do in one that specifically wants to <em>avoid</em> becoming the next MySpace. If we were ever to realize the IMGZ vision and change the world, we needed more people.</p>
<h2>We're hiring!</h2>
<p>If you're young, passionate about creating software that changes the world and don't know what "3x investor preference" means, you're exactly who we're looking for! You have the opportunity to join an innovative, fast-growing company with a modern technology stack.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we don't just want to serve images, no. The values of IMGZ are far loftier than that. At IMGZ we live and breathe images to the point where our values can only be communicated <strong>with</strong> an image:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/i9xyk2H2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In talking with various prospective hires, one thing became abundantly clear: Nobody joins a startup for the money, they do it to get rich. With this in mind, we found the perfect balance of the "early startup employee" compensation package: 50% stock, 50% equity, 0% salary.</p>
<p>That's right! We can maximize the potential of your stock by doing away with a significant company expense: Employee salaries. This way, your stock is much more likely to be worth a lot more (and you have a lot of it, since our packages start at three trillion shares per employee! That's a big number).</p>
<p>Everyone we discussed this with loved the approach, and it makes intuitive sense: Name one Google employee who became a millionaire from their salary. We bet you can't, yet all of us know the name of that cleaning lady who was given Google stock and now she has "VC" on her CV, you know the one we're talking about.</p>
<h2>Interview process</h2>
<p>Like any self-respecting Silicon Valley startup, we can't just settle for any old 10x rockstar developer who wants to join. Firing people is expensive, you know? That is why we have prepared a thorough, six-stage interview process.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a pragmatic, practice-driven development team, and we want to see how you perfom in real-world scenarios, so you will be given a feature from our product roadmap and will be asked to develop it to your satisfaction. Afterwards, we will use this feature in our product and see how users like it. If they do, that will be a point in your favor.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't really know if you developed the feature yourself or paid someone on Fiverr to do it for you, so for the next stage of the interview we will ask you to invert a data structure on a whiteboard. None of us knows how or cares enough about what you're doing, so we'll pretend to not like random things about your solution until you're on the verge of tears, to evaluate how you fare against the ever-changing requirements that come with bad leadership.</p>
<p>If you pass the whiteboard interviews without cracking, we'll introduce you to everyone on the team, making sure you have at least eight hours of one-on-one time with various staff members, often more than once. This is just so we get to know you better and see what you're like in social situations.</p>
<p>After wasting a few days of your time and ours, we'll finally adjourn and haphazardly email each other about you, mostly trying to remember which applicant you were from flaws in your appearance. We'll then round up all the notes and observations from your technical interviews and summarize everything we know about you into one list.</p>
<p>For the final decision, we'll look at the list and evaluate you purely on your technical merits, trying to confirm the judgment that we've already subconsciously formed based on how much you are like us. If you are too different, we're sorry, no matter how good you are technically, we'll pass. In this company, we value one thing above all others: Diversity.</p>
<h2>Apply today!</h2>
<p>If the above sounds appealing, excellent! Reach out to us at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><span data-cfemail="264e4f544f4841664f4b415c0845494b">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to get the ball rolling, and you might soon be "working" for the best image host in the world, IMGZ!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
    <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>The aim of this post is to show you how to build a Kubernetes cluster with Raspberry Pi 4s for self-hosting APIs, websites and functions so that you can expose them on the Internet and serve traffic to users. Use it to evaluate your current setup, or to plan a new build including: hardware options, HA, Ingress, storage and Operating System choices.</p>
<p>We'll start by addressing the usual questions, before going on to explore a number of topics in detail. These are my preferences built-up after <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/five-years-of-raspberry-pi-clusters/">building clusters on Raspberry Pi for 5 years</a>. I'd also like to learn from you, so feel free to tweet to me <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk">@alexellisuk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why self host?</strong></p>
<p>The only valid reason here is: because you want to. And if the idea of self-hosting something turns you off, then stop reading now and post a derisive comment on Hacker News.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUpF40--60"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnSvvQRXcAEEr1w?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="My demo rig for the KubeCon talk"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>KubeCon talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUpF40--60">The Past, Present, and Future of Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The costs of cloud</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was speaking to a friend recently that told me they were paying 7USD / mo to host 20 small projects on a well-known PaaS. That would have been costing them around 1700USD per year, moving those workloads to an RPi would save a fortune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Running a Kubernetes cluster on one of the cheapest providers like <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f0d7296632e4">DigitalOcean</a> can still set you back 60-120 USD / mo for a modest cluster. You can get much better value with your own hardware, whether that's with an old PC or some Raspberry Pis. I'm not saying that you should call your boss and give him the good news, but there is a certain crowd who enjoy building and running infrastructure, they also tend to enjoy cost savings.</p>
<p><strong>"But, I have no use-case"</strong></p>
<p>Quite often my content on Raspberry Pi can be divisive. It brings the best out of some people, and the worst out of others.</p>
<p>Let me put this succinctly - the Raspberry Pi is a Linux server. If you write code, or "do DevOps" for a day-job, you have a use-case. If you use a computer on a daily basis, you have a use-case.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/4rea8y.jpg" alt="Meme"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll just leave this here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why use the Raspberry Pi?</strong></p>
<p>If you have the budget to buy some used workstations, NUCs, or servers on eBay, they will perform better, but they also take up more space and draw more power. Fortunately, most of what we'll cover will apply to Raspberry Pi and whatever Intel kit you can get your hands on.</p>
<p><strong>But, I thought SD cards were unreliable?</strong></p>
<p>Now that the <a href="https://alexellisuk.medium.com/upgrade-your-raspberry-pi-4-with-a-nvme-boot-drive-d9ab4e8aa3c2">RPi 4 can boot from an SSD or NVMe over USB</a>, the reliability of SD cards no longer needs to be a concern. The RPi 4 has much faster I/O, up to 8GB of RAM available along with a quad-core processor. Not only is it suitable for self-hosting many types of application, but it is likely to outperform smaller shared VPSes or EC2 instances since it's a dedicated host.</p>
<p>It's now trivial to build a cluster that can tolerate a node failure using K3s and its now embedded etcd mode which was introduced in K3s 1.19.</p>
<p>There are naturally some draw-backs to self-hosting: you have a dependency on your ISP's uptime, your significant other or children could unplug your infrastructure (yes it happens), but I think you will have fun and hone your skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So whether you're building a home-lab, or looking to host websites, APIs and automation tools, I hope you'll find the recommendations useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ep3STrhWMAAL7mz?format=jpg&amp;name=small" alt="The parts from my latest build"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The parts from my latest K3s build</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="billofmaterialshardware">Bill of materials (hardware)</h3>
<p>You will need at least one Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GB RAM or more. I would recommend that you buy three if you wish to run a HA cluster, that can tolerate a node failure.</p>
<p><strong>Managing costs</strong></p>
<p>Let me put this in bold: <strong>you do not need to spend a fortune to build a cluster</strong>. 4x RPi 4 including taxes in the UK runs to about 33 GBP per unit ~ about 130 GBP total. If you just want the experience of self-hosting, and to learn about Kubernetes without having to spend too much, you could buy a single 4GB RPi 4 for around 54 GBP including taxes.</p>
<p><strong>A note on the RPi3</strong></p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 3 and CM3 are both <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2353">having issues with K3s</a>, particulary if you are running anything later than 1.17. If you have an existing investment (as I do), I would suggest selling them or giving them away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cases and cooling off</strong></p>
<p>Whatever case you decide to use, make sure it has a fan. You can compare options in my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/cooling-off-your-rpi4/">Cooling off your Raspberry Pi 4</a>.</p>
<p>The best options for cases are either one of the sets of acrylic plates and stand-offs that can be bought for 20-25 USD on Amazon, or a professional-grade <a href="https://bitscope.com/blog/JK/?p=JK38B">BitScope Cluster Blade</a>. Whatever you do, do not buy the original first-generation BitScope Blade which doesn't support the RPi4 or have cooling.</p>
<p><strong>Buy the best power adapter</strong></p>
<p>Do not buy a multi-charger for the RPi4, they may appear to work, however if you look into things you will find that they are "browning out". Official adapters are not expensive, my advise is not to be stingy.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to storage, you will need at least a 32GB SD card, but I would encourage you to go one further and buy solid state storage. Read about the performance differences in my post: <a href="https://alexellisuk.medium.com/upgrade-your-raspberry-pi-4-with-a-nvme-boot-drive-d9ab4e8aa3c2">Upgrade your Raspberry Pi 4 with a NVMe boot drive</a>. Some ask whether an M2 SSD is sufficient with the USB-bus of the RPi4 causing a bottleneck. They make a good point however the NVMe performs better, has a similar cost and can be used in one of your PCs at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="kuberneteskubeadmvsk3s">Kubernetes - kubeadm vs. k3s?</h3>
<p>Until late 2019, most of us were still struggling to run <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/k8s-on-raspbian">upstream Kubernetes on our RPis with kubeadm</a>, and it was not a pleasant experience. Why? Because kubeadm was designed to run on high-performance Intel cloud servers, not on low-powered ARM SoCs.</p>
<p><img width="30%" src="https://k3s.io/images/logo-k3s.svg" alt="k3s"></p><p>The headlines for K3s claim 500MB of RAM is required for a server, increasing 256MB when using embedded etcd. The claim for an agent is 50MB of RAM. Whatever the actual usage is, it's going to be much less than kubeadm and put less of a load on the system.</p>
<h3 id="32bitor64bitos">32-bit or 64-bit OS?</h3>
<p>From my perspective the main limitation of a 32-bit OS is the 3GB process limit. That isn't something that I'm particularly worried about, but maybe you are? What the question really comes down to is: do you want to use Ubuntu or RaspiOS?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Raspi-PGB001.png" width="30%">
<img src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/fe951eda-20.10_Groovy+Gorilla_RPi_Sketch.svg" width="20%"></p><p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation do have a beta version of RaspiOS out, however it isn't the lite edition and comes with a fully-loaded desktop.</p>
<p>In my experience with K3s, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-20-10-on-raspberry-pi-delivers-the-full-linux-desktop-and-micro-clouds">Ubuntu 20.10</a> works equally well as RaspiOS Lite on the RPi4. I tend to recommend with RaspiOS with its 32-bit OS because most Raspberry Pi users already use this and are comfortable with it.</p>
<h3 id="sourcingappsandcharts">Sourcing apps and charts</h3>
<p>Sourcing apps and charts can be tricky with ARM, as many maintainers have not yet considering porting their software to this architecture.</p>
<p>For that reason I built the <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a> project as an Open Source Kubernetes Marketplace. You can use it to install apps whether they are packaged as Helm charts, YAML manifests or shipped with their own CLI.</p>
<p>Why not use helm? Well in some instances it does, but where a package is not available for ARM, it will tell you. Where a chart has 150 configuration options, the <code>--help</code> text tells you the ones we think you'll need. The <code>arkade info APP</code> command gives you instructions on how to use the chart, and you can get that back at any time without installing the app again.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/raw/master/docs/arkade-logo-sm.png" width="20%"><br>
There are now over 40 packages and many contributors. Notable packages that work on Raspberry Pi are: Minio, OpenFaaS, cert-manager, ingress-nginx, Traefik 2, Linkerd, SealedSecrets and the Kubernetes dashboard.</p>
<p>You can install of them using arkade install:</p>
<pre><code>arkade install APP
</code></pre>
<p>arkade also offers a fast download of CLIs to prevent breaking the flow when you're following instructions. How many times have you ran "brew update" and then instantly regretted it?</p>
<pre><code>arkade get kubectl [--version 0.19.5]
arkade get kubectx
arkade get helm
arkade get terraform
</code></pre>
<p>Each package is downloaded as a static binary and put in your PATH. It doesn't matter if you're using Intel or ARM, Linux, MacOS or Windows, the correct binary (if available) will be downloaded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Whatever you do, resist the urge to run "third-party" or community builds of tools you recognise. This is asking for trouble, the code could be doing anything to your computers and network. See also: "Poison docker images"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ingressandloadbalancers">Ingress and LoadBalancers</h3>
<p>There are two main ways I would expose services on Kubernetes. The first is to use a LoadBalancer, this is what you will be most used to from using managed Kubernetes clusters. By setting your Service as a <code>type: LoadBalancer</code> and giving a number of ports, a cloud load-balancer is provisioned and starts routing traffic on the given IP address.</p>
<p>When running at home, you can use a tool like <a href="https://kube-vip.io/">kube-vip</a> or <a href="https://metallb.universe.tf/">MetalLB</a>, but they will only give you IP addresses on your local network, which external users cannot access. If you are thinking of using these tools, you may as well just use a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">NodePort</a> and forego the additional tooling. A NodePort makes a high port number such as 31112 available on all your nodes, which then routes traffic to the exposed service.</p>
<p>Many homelab'ers will be aware of port-forwarding, where your home router can be set to forward traffic on a given set of ports to hosts on your internal network. This is achieved through mapping a high non-standard port number to the internal port. Unfortunately, many home users are inadvertently giving away their location, their ISP customer number (Virgin Media, I'm looking at you), and in some instance, a good estimation of their home address. Now on top of all of that, you cannot take that IP address with you, so if you close the lid of your laptop running K3s, and open the lid on a captive portal in a coffee shop, your services will no longer be available.</p>
<p>Likewise, your IP is likely to change. The mitigation is to run a daemon that continually checks your IP address and updates your DNS records.</p>
<p>That all sounds like a lot of hard work to me.</p>
<p>In the early days, I used to use Ngrok which tunnels out from your internal network, but unfortunately I kept running into its connection and rate-limiting. It also has no Kubernetes integration, and it's not for lack of trying - Joe Beda (a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 20, 2020<!-- --> in<!-- --> <span><a href="https://healeycodes.com/tags/python">Python</a></span></p></header><section><p>I have been learning chess (again) and how to program a chess engine (for the first time) over the last month. After skimming some introductory texts, I was convinced that building a simple chess engine — one that would put up a fair fight against a casual player — would take no more than a few days.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>But I made it there in the end and created a toy chess engine (<a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">healeycodes/andoma</a>) that I am proud of. It can play a game of chess and solve simple chess puzzles like mate-in-two or mate-in-three. It has a slim UCI interface which means it can be hooked up to lichess.org via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a> — a bridge between the lichess API and chess bots.</p>
<p>The first speed bump in its development was grasping the computational the complexity of chess — how fast, and wide, the search tree grows. When a chess game starts, white can open in twenty different ways and black can respond in twenty different ways also. After the first full turn, there are 400 variations possible. After the third full turn, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number#Shannon's_calculation">over 119 million</a>.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon calculated that there are around <code>10^120</code> possible games of chess in his seminal paper <em>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</em> in 1950. In <em>Rage Against the Machines</em>, Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rage-against-the-machines/">quotes</a> Diego Rasskin-Gutman, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are more possible chess games than the number of atoms in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given unlimited resources, it actually doesn’t take many lines of code to calculate every legal variation of chess. Here, the Python package <a href="https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-chess</a> is used for board representation and legal move generation.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> chess <span>import</span> Board<span>,</span> Move<span>,</span> STARTING_FEN

        board<span>.</span>pop<span>(</span><span>)</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>

<p>This program throws a <code>RecursionError</code> and prints <code>59691</code> — the number of different positions the search tree contained when it crashed. All we need to fix this, is another universe to run the program in.</p>
<p>Given that there are computational limits to abide by, as well as the time control rules of chess, improvements over a naive brute force search must be made.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" aria-label="evaluation permalink"></a>Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to search for good positions, it is necessary to understand what makes a good position <em>good</em>. The most simplistic way of describing a position’s strength is to compare the total value material of each side.</p>
<p>Tomasz Michniewski, author of the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function">Simplified Evaluation Function</a>, defined some values that are “designed specifically to compensate for the lack of any other chess knowledge”. This is perfect for me — a beginner chess player.</p>
<p>This snippet sums the material on the initial board using Michniewski’s piece values.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> chess

piece_values <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    chess<span>.</span>PAWN<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>

    chess<span>.</span>KING<span>:</span> <span>20000</span>
<span>}</span>

board <span>=</span> chess<span>.</span>Board<span>(</span>chess<span>.</span>STARTING_FEN<span>)</span>
white_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
black_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<span>for</span> square <span>in</span> chess<span>.</span>SQUARES<span>:</span>
    piece <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>piece_at<span>(</span>square<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> piece<span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>
    <span>if</span> piece<span>.</span>color <span>==</span> chess<span>.</span>WHITE<span>:</span>
        white_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        black_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Michniewski also provides <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Piece-Square_Tables">piece-square tables</a>, which alter the value of a piece depending on which square it sits on. For example, it’s better for pawns to progress up the board and it’s better for knights to be near the center of the board.</p>
<p>The bonus of a square may be positive, neutral, or negative. The piece-square tables are presented from White’s POV and must be mirrored for Black.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># a knight's bonuses depending on square
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,
-40,-20,  0,  0,  0,  0,-20,-40,
-30,  0, 10, 15, 15, 10,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 15, 20, 20, 15,  5,-30,
-30,  0, 15, 20, 20, 15,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 10, 15, 15, 10,  5,-30,
-40,-20,  0,  5,  5,  0,-20,-40,
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,</code></pre></div>
<p>For the king, Michniewski provides two tables — one for the middle game and one for the end game. He defines the end game as being either if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both sides have no queens or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every side which has a queen has additionally no other pieces or one minorpiece maximum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evaluation of a chess board is one of the things that’s kept me interested in chess engines. Evaluation rules are easy to add and take away. I refactored the code from Go to Python to be able to prototype different rules faster.</p>
<p>After piece-square tables, one might look at pawn structure, mobility, center control, connectivity, trapped pieces, king safety, space, tempo, and other patterns (this list is taken from the Chess Programming Wiki’s <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation">Evaluation</a> page).</p>
<h2 id="searching-with-minimax"><a href="#searching-with-minimax" aria-label="searching with minimax permalink"></a>Searching With Minimax</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> is a search algorithm that finds the next optimal move by minimizing the potential loss in a worst case scenario. Chess is a game of perfect information — by looking at the board it’s possible to know exactly what an opponent is capable of. However, this search for moves is limited by the evaluation function and the depth that computing resources are able to reach.</p>
<p>The search space is a tree of legal moves which grows exponentially at every level (the average branching factor is around 35). By the time the tree is explored, the path to many future boards is known as well as which path restricts the opponent’s possible gains the most.</p>
<p>The leaf nodes of the tree return the evaluation of their current state. Non-leaf nodes inherit their value from a descendant node. Eventually, the recursive function reduces down to a value for the given board.</p>
<p>This function can be used to pick the next best move by calling it on every legal move available in the current turn. A great visual resource for this algorithm is Sebastian Lague’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">Algorithms Explained – minimax and alpha-beta pruning</a>.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-beta-pruning"><a href="#alpha-beta-pruning" aria-label="alpha beta pruning permalink"></a>Alpha-beta pruning</h2>
<p>My chess engine uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a> as an improvement over the naive minimax algorithm — which does not fare well against the exponential nature of chess. Branches of the search tree can be eliminated when it is clear that another branch shows more promise. This significantly reduces the number of moves required to be generated.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/a99200aacf6d6cfc643aaa45317d65aa/42a19/alpha-beta-pruning.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>By reducing the depth of branches that will not bear fruit we can search deeper down the better parts of the tree.</p>
<p>The speed of alpha-beta pruning can be increased by applying <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Ordering">move ordering</a>. This is where the more promising branches of the search tree are searched first — which means less time is spent in the worst branches as they will be cut off early.</p>
<p>Move ordering cannot be 100% accurate but it’s a powerful optimization.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">my engine</a>, a cheap (but not perfect) <code>move_value</code> function is used to sort the initial legal move nodes from best to worst. The logic of this function is capture in its docstring:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>'''
How good is a move?
A promotion is great.
A weaker piece taking a stronger piece is good.
A stronger piece taking a weaker piece is bad.
Also consider the position change via piece-square table.
'''</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="communication-and-the-uci-protocol"><a href="#communication-and-the-uci-protocol" aria-label="communication and the uci protocol permalink"></a>Communication and the UCI Protocol</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma/blob/main/uci-interface.md">Universal Chess Interface</a> (UCI) is a open protocol to hook up chess engines to user interfaces. The communication is done through standard input and standard output and messages end with <code>\n</code>. The move format is long algebraic notation — like <code>e2e4</code>, or <code>e1g1</code> for white short castling, and an example of a promotion to queen is <code>a7a8q</code>.</p>
<p>There are many configuration commands in the specification and it initially seemed overwhelming. After debugging, I found that not many were required to get a chess engine to the <em>Hello World</em> stage.</p>
<p>In order to hook my chess engine up to lichess via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a>, I implemented the following. These commands are send to the engine from lichess-bot:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uci</code> - the engine reports its name, authors, and <code>uciok</code></li>
<li><code>isready</code> - the engine reports that it’s ready: <code>readyok</code></li>
<li><code>position startpos moves e2e4</code> - the engine sets it’s internal state to match the list of moves</li>
<li><code>go</code> - the engine should now calculate and respond with the next best move, like <code>g8f6</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-promise"><a href="#a-promise" aria-label="a promise permalink"></a>A Promise</h2>
<p>I have found a great joy interacting with the chess community over the last month. Lichess is a fantastic resource and endlessly fun to play on.

<p>I took breaks from writing this article to play chess against Dad on a real board. We’re missing a white rook and use a pencil sharpener as a replacement piece. He has been telling me stories about playing chess decades ago — before IBM’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a> emerged and beat Garry Kasparov, the reigning world champion, on its second attempt in 1997.</p>
<p>If you are within my social circle, you will have experienced me evangelizing chess and chess engines over the last month — now that I have published this, I promise to chill out a little bit ♟️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" data-v-5bed0c61=""><div data-v-5bed0c61=""> <div data-v-5bed0c61=""><div data-v-5bed0c61=""><p>The internet is a wide place.</p>
<p>Last April, amid the COVID-19 induced panic, Fox News interviewed a doctor about the US government’s response to the epidemic.</p>
<p>But his responses to the questions in the interview didn't go as well as the network was hoping.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the interview went viral. More than 10 million views on Twitter for the 90 second clip.</p>
<p>Before the interview, the doctor, <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiDesaiMD">Rishi Desai</a>, didn't have much of a social media presence. So he created a new account on Twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/rishi_desai.png" alt="Rishi Desai"></p><p>I still remember watching in disbelief as the account gained over 30 thousand followers in under 24 hours.</p>
<p>No connections, no brand, no tweets, no marketing. Just a viral 90-second video.</p>
<br>

<h3>Dumb Luck</h3>

<p>Of course, "followers" is only a vanity metric. An Instagram model with over 2 million followers <a href="https://www.insider.com/instagrammer-arii-2-million-followers-cannot-sell-36-t-shirts-2019-5">couldn't sell 36 shirts</a> when she launched her brand. A big audience doesn't mean much if they're not engaged. <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1000 true fans</a> and all that.</p>
<p>But it's mind-boggling how much a viral piece of content can change things.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwestco">Alex</a> recently got his first $50/mo customer. Excited, he shared the news in a tweet.</p>
<br>
<blockquote data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got my first $50/mo customer! 🎉</p>— Alex West 🚀 (@alexwestco) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwestco/status/1252656159636545538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  
<p>The next day, he woke up to hundreds of likes, 1000 new followers, and 10k visitors to his website.</p>
<p>This tweet was an <a href="https://www.alexwest.co/posts/129">inflection point</a> for his business. It put him on the radar, and his business has been on an upward trajectory since.</p>
<p>Why did this particular tweet go viral? There doesn't seem to be any apparent reason. In Alex's words, "luck smiled at me and things went crazy."</p>
<p>This sort of thing happens all the time. A travel blogger's viral Twitter thread that gets her 13k followers. A designer managing to <a href="https://tr.af/6">make six figures</a> in 6 days after a screenshot of his phone goes viral. A <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">blog post</a> that turns into a <a href="https://www.effortlessoutput.com/">side-business</a>.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: as lucky as these might seem, this luck didn't come out of thin air.</p>
<p>Alex has been tweeting consistently every day before his viral tweet. Traf has been making and selling designs online for years. Nat has hundreds of articles on his website.</p>
<p>As a wise man once said, "the harder I work, the luckier I get".</p>
<p>Think of it this way: On average, a piece of content does okay relative to your audience. Some might do bad, some might do a little better. And some can go viral.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/not_so_viral_chart.png" alt="Not so viral"></p><p>How do you increase the number of viral content? Simple: you increase the total number of content!</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/viral_chart.png" alt="Viral"></p><p>Shortly after starting his new project, Harry David saw <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/marketing-examples/4700-new-followers-overnight--LyJM6b62tFbqwiW9nLW">a huge uptick</a> in his audience size when Steve Schoger retweeted one of his Twitter threads. But this wasn't Harry's first post – he has been pushing great content for months before that. It was only a matter of time before one of them went viral.</p>
<p>Take consistent action. If you want a viral blog, don't write one post; write 10. If you want to make a sale, don't reach out to 10 prospects; reach out to 100. </p>
<p>Consistency compounds. Wildly so on the internet. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<div id="cs-content"><div id="x-section-1"><div><div><div><p>An instruction set architecture (ISA) is crucial to the development of processors and their software ecosystems. In the last half century, the majority of ISAs have been owned by single companies, whether product companies for their own chips/systems or processor IP companies who licensed their processors to chip developers. Does <strong>ISA ownership</strong> matter? Let’s consider three proprietary ISAs and their history.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Alpha ISA was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for its workstations and servers and was released in 1992. In the mid-1990s, this was considered a&nbsp;worthy competitor to SPARC and MIPS RISC architectures. However, the ownership of the ISA transferred to Compaq when DEC was acquired in 1998. Compaq in turn sold the rights to the Alpha ISA to Intel in 2001, and in the same year Compaq was acquired by Hewlett Packard. The last Alpha-based products were released in 2004, meaning that the ISA was effectively dead because of a&nbsp;series of acquisitions.</p>
<p>MIPS Technologies was spun out of Silicon Graphics as an independent IP company in 1998. For some years it enjoyed some success, particularly at the higher end of the processor IP market, and was only the second architecture to have Android ported in 2009. However, with a&nbsp;declining share price, MIPS sold 498 patents to AST and agreed to an acquisition by Imagination Technology in 2013. After Canyon Bridge acquired Imagination, MIPS was spun-out again ending up, after a&nbsp;series of transactions, as part of Wave Computing. As an artificial intelligence silicon provider, Wave is a&nbsp;potential competitor to some MIPS licensees.</p>
<p>Wave tried to encourage the adoption of the MIPS ISA in competition to RISC-V through their MIPS Open Initiative in late 2018. However, the licensing terms contained some onerous conditions relating to patents. In late 2019, Wave suddenly shut down the program, giving zero notice. The important lesson is that even if an ISA is open, its future is not secure if it is commercially owned. Seven years of ownership change have seen MIPS’ market share spiral downwards.</p>
<p>The third example is Arm, the biggest processor IP company of them all. Arm has long been seen as not only a&nbsp;big, successful IP company, but one offering “Swiss neutrality” in the semiconductor industry. Arm was quite distinct from both semiconductor companies and EDA companies. As such, it enjoyed a&nbsp;position of trust from its licensees as it did not have a conflict of interest. With its acquisition by SoftBank in 2016, Arm lost control over its destiny, even though SoftBank was not competing with its licensees. With the planned acquisition of Arm by NVIDIA, announced in September 2020, Arm will lose its neutrality completely. As a&nbsp;semiconductor company, there is a&nbsp;conflict of interest between Arm’s owners and its licensees, meaning it can no longer be trusted in the same way.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the ‘Tale of three ISAs’, the <strong>ownership</strong> of an ISA matters a&nbsp;lot, regardless of whether the ISA is commercially licensed or open. Acquisitions can lead to the disappearance of an ISA through merging of product lines or through making licensing difficult. Another motive for taking over a&nbsp;company can even be to kill off a&nbsp;competing product line, which in the case of an ISA could catastrophically impact licensees.</p>
<p>ISA ownership is one of the key issues that the developers of RISC-V have thought about. By transferring the ownership of the ISA to RISC-V International, the original developers of the ISA have assured its longevity. Longevity is assured both by the <strong>independent ownership of the ISA</strong> and the fact that licensees have a&nbsp;<strong>choice of IP vendors</strong> supporting the same open standard. Thirdly, once ratified, the ISA is <strong>frozen</strong> assuring software developers that their code will be able run on suitable cores indefinitely.</p>

<p>This story is a bit long, but I promise it will be worth it, because it contains the two most important principles every designer must know and take to heart if you intend to do great work anywhere, under almost any circumstances, over the long, long haul of your career.</p>



<h2>The Bronze Age of me</h2>



<p>Early in my career, before the web, when I was in advertising, I had the good fortune to work for legendary creative directors. They’d amassed so many awards in their careers that, in the event of Apocalypse, they could have melted their shiny trophies down and lived off the barter value of the metal.</p>



<p>These old men were giants who had once strode the halls of famous agencies, but ours was not famous—at least not for being good. It was a reeking quagmire where great ideas went to die.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our company knew it had a problem, so it kept hiring brilliant creative leaders, paying them to inspire us demoralized and underpaid young art directors and copywriters, and pitting us against an internal culture that had been designed quite carefully to neutralize and kill the kind of work our ever-changing cast of overlords challenged us to create.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Let me unpack that.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Our clients were makers of aspirin and ointments. They owned financially successful chain restaurants. If it ached, if it bled, if it could be satisfied with heaping plates of deeply fried or sauce-drowned food-like products at a family-friendly low price, we probably handled its advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of advertising, painstakingly crafted to offend no one, and baited with jingles that stick, unwanted, in the mind, works chiefly by being shown so many times that it can’t help but lodge in the collective consciousness and inexorably drive sales. Think McDonald’s, but smaller and less … glamorous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saturation is the name of the game, and the agency (like others of its kind) made its money by taking a commission on media placement.&nbsp;<em>Creative was something we gave away free.</em> All we wanted was a cut of the fee broadcasters charged to run the stuff.</p>



<h2>Fear of a creative planet</h2>



<p>A great ad—one people talked about, one that potentially risked offending a few people—would destroy the cozy and lucrative business relationships on which the agency was founded. The company knew it, and hired skilled account executives to prevent even a moderately good idea from ever reaching the airwaves.</p>



<p><em>But…</em></p>



<p>Creative advertising was much talked-about in the popular culture of the time, and our clients asked for it even though they wouldn’t have bought it to save their children’s lives. So the agency occasionally had to show a good idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides, we young art directors and copywriters were idealists, and the agency wasn’t paying us enough to buy our loyalty. They <em>might</em> have distributed the profits more equitably, but the account executives had houses in Darien and ex-spouses to support, so they couldn’t afford to waste any of that money on the troops who did the work the whole thing ran on.</p>



<p>Hence every six months the company hired new creative directors who, we grunts thought, would finally “turn this place around” and allow us to do the kind of work we dreamed of.</p>



<p>This is how our company came to hire legendary award winners. And although we never sold a great ad, the lesson I learned from them turned out to be the second most important guiding principle of my work as a designer. The first, most important principle, of course, is listen to the customer. But this other principle comes a close second.</p>



<p>The principle these creative directors taught me, chiefly by how they acted, was…</p>



<h2>Never give up.</h2>



<p>Never stop trying to do great work. Never get demoralized. Never stop caring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It sounds simple. It isn’t.</p>



<p>I watched these creative directors and their partners work all night to produce a great idea in spite of all the constraints around the client and product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I watched them enthusiastically present great work internally. Watched the internal folks sabotage it through fear. Watched my leaders cheerfully go back to the drawing board and come up with something new by the next morning.</p>



<p>I watched them enact this ritual a half-dozen times before the work even got shown to the clients.</p>



<p>I watched the clients shoot it down. I watched my leaders cheerfully get up, put their materials away, come back to the agency, and start over.</p>



<p>Never, not once, did they dial it in. Never did they just shrug their shoulders and say, “Fine, I’ll give these people what they want.” They listened to the customer but the customer didn’t dictate. The customer’s business problem dictated the creative solution. The solution would work if the customer bought it. If the customer didn’t buy, well, there was another great creative solution out there, if you just worked hard enough to find it.</p>



<p>Even in those extremely backwards times, there were great women creative directors out there, too—but our agency never hired one, so I only got to meet these men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were old men—one of them, who leaned forward with a hunch, and always walked as if he were in pain—looked like Moses. I swear he stared through my soul when I tried to go home before 8:00 PM. (We worked in offices then, and you never went home before your boss.) He scared me but I liked him.</p>



<div><p>Once I asked if he missed the “great” clients he had worked for in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>“Great clients?”</p><p>“Like Volkswagen.”</p></div>



<p>“They killed just as many good ads as these guys do.”</p>



<p>“What did you do?”</p>



<p>“Came up with more ads.”</p>



<p>The ability to keep coming up with more ads was why this Moses-looking dude had a roomful of shiny trophies, and I did not. If I wanted a career like his, I would have to seek deeply in my soul for the strength and willingness not to give up.</p>



<p>Career aside,<em>&nbsp;if I wanted to create meaningful work,</em>&nbsp;I would need to develop the patience and willingness to watch people kill my darlings, and come back with newer, fresher, better darlings.</p>







<p>I have not done it perfectly, not by a long shot. But keeping a positive attitude when an idea I’ve fallen in love with gets rejected remains the second most important thing I can do on a daily basis as I practice my current craft.</p>



<p>Both product work and client work are tough. The challenges can seem overwhelming. We bang our heads. We weep. Finally, we and our teammates come up with a solution. This is it! We’ve done it! Joyfully, we share it. Our lead shoots holes in it. Maybe because it runs afoul of some important learning we didn’t know about. Or because it was tried before we got here and tested badly. Or, sometimes, because they just don’t like it.</p>



<p>We come back with three ideas and none of them are quite right, either.</p>



<p>So we go back and work harder and come up with new stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The well is never dry. We only run out of ideas when we choose to stop doing the work.</p>



<p>The designers I work with here today inspire me on many levels. Their energy, their talent, their sheer skill impresses me. But what blows me away most of all, is that the really good designers stand up to the misfortune of a killed idea. They take away the lesson of what went wrong, and come back with something that much stronger. Or, if not stronger, something different but equally good.</p>



<p>Never give up.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>This article was inspired by a conversation I had with one of our designers, after watching her respond graciously and positively while working on a tough project.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Every few years there comes a technology that people get hyped about, everyone wants to be a specialist in that field because it appears to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>Between 2015-2019 this was largely about bitcoins and blockchain technology. Everyone wanted to be a specialist in blockchain technology. Bitcoin was booming, ICOs were happening to the left and right.</p>
<p>And people were trying to introduce/incorporate blockchain technology into everything they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>Yes sometimes blockchain technology can improve the existing system. However, when you try to introduce blockchain or any other technology into something that doesn’t require it,the results can be disastrous.</p>
<p>This is a story I wanted to write for a very long time, it was about a small startup called BlockEvent. A small startup that wanted to incorporate blockchain technology into event management.</p>
<p><em>Their website blockevent.tk is now not functioning, and I was unable to find a web archive snapshot. A mirror exists on a different domain, please check the footnotes.</em></p>
<p>Blockchain on event management has been there before BlockEvents. Smart ticketing and smart contracts are currently being used to improve the ticketing field and control pricing etc.</p>
<h2>BlockEvent</h2>
<p>BlockEvents wanted to make the whole event process a decentralized mechanism. From user data, to events, to registration, everything was supposed to be “decentralized” and was “not accessible” to and “not modifiable” by anyone.</p>
<p>According to the BlockEvent team, </p>
<blockquote><p>We made BlockEvent as a decentralized system. That means no central party can control this booking process and it will work without any third party involvement. </p><p>BlockEvent acts as a bridge between the organizers and the participants where organizers come and create events through our system, and participants can come and book their tickets. </p><p>The whole process is done through Public Blockchain.</p><p>… </p><p>Using the blockchain for user identity management is a whole new paradigm.</p><cite>BlockEvent on one of their Facebook posts, describing their system. </cite></blockquote>
<p>BlockEvent when initially started mainly hosted monthly blockchain event meetup events. However, their big break came in May 2019, during the annual Google I/O.</p>
<p>Google I/O event is celebrated in Sri Lanka every year, with local tech companies hosting events of their own, with local influencers, while live streaming the Google I/O event.</p>
<p>The selection process is a very completions, hundreds of people compete for few limited number of seats. These events are a good place to network and meet new friends in IT field. Plus you end up getting some cool swags.</p>
<p>In order to be selected to these events you need to show that you are a tech person, usually they check your GitHub page, blog or YouTube channel. And the tech company will select and send an invitation to whom they think are the most suitable to attend their events.</p>
<p>Until 2018, this was done by using a simple Google form or a regular website.</p>
<p>However, in 2019, one of the largest tech and telecom companies in Sri Lanka decided to use BlockEvents to host their Google I/O event.</p>
<p>Getting selected by a big company like them to manage their Google I/O event was big deal, because they host one of the largest I/O events in Sri Lanka. And BlockEvent can leverage this to opportunity to get bigger clients in future.</p>
<p>It was their make or break moment. They had to nail it, and if they failed then for a small startup like BlockEvent, the damage to their reputation is going to hurt them to a point where there is no return.</p>
<h2><strong>Disaster</strong> </h2>
<p>BlockEvent also in their description, said this,</p>
<blockquote><p>To ensure the user data privacy and security, <strong>we are not storing any user credentials or password</strong>[s] <strong>in our database. Even the user emails are stored as a hash. Only the users know their passwords </strong>and that will provide 100% control over your account actions. Even BlockEvent team can’t access your accounts. </p><cite>BlockEvent describing their system in a Facebook post</cite></blockquote>
<p>Since they were storing <strong>everything </strong>in the blockchain, they were not storing even user emails and passwords. This may sound as a good privacy focused system. But this will come to hurt BlockEvent in a very bad way.</p>
<p>Since no one else other than the people in monthly blockchain meetups knew about BlockEvents, like in any other new service, most people registering for the local Google I/O event used either throwaway passwords, or new passwords which they forgot or didn’t save.</p>
<p>This caused large number of people to forget their passwords. If we use a normal database to store user data, with no hashing, they would have been able to reset the user passwords.</p>
<p>However, since everything is stored in blockchain, and everything were hashed, this meant that there is no way to reset a user password. </p>
<p>This led to large number of people being locked out of their accounts, unable to create new accounts with the existing emails, and BlockEvent team unable to reset passwords.</p>
<p>This caused a wave of negative reviews on BlockEvent Facebook page and on social media. Some users demanded the organizers to go back to the old system of using a Google form for user registration.</p>
<p>BlockEvent finally responded to their users, they had no way to reseat the password. Unless you remember the password and login, or you are permanently locked out from using the account.</p>

<blockquote><p>Due to the rules of decentralization, we can’t reset your passwords as we are giving priority to user data and security.

<p>BlockEvent also asked participants to send their personal details on Facebook and via a Google form, so they can manually arrange a way to send the gift pack to the participants.</p>
<p>Some of the users accused the selection process was also flawed and complained that some of the people who were less qualified to attend the event were selected over them.</p>
<p>All this led to irreplaceable damage on BlockEvent, and the Google I/O event didn’t happen due to the Easter Sunday bombings. </p>
<p>BlockEvent went into hiatus few months later, all thought they never mentioned that they are shutting down, their website went offline once their domain name expired. Possibly signaling the end of the startup that hoped to decentralize how we manage identity online.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong> </h2>
<p>The title of the post is <strong>“Somethings are never meant to be invented”</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter how utopian the idea may sound like, guaranteeing 100% user privacy with everything stored on a blockchain, not even giving access to user email to the creators can have its own drawbacks.</p>
<p>And since we are all humans, and we all tend to make mistakes, there has to be a fail safe mechanism, that will keep things in check and can undo the mistakes when we make one.</p>
<p>Also a single use password is a very bad idea, not only that users can lose their passwords, but also in the event of a data breach, user handing over the password to a third party by a mistake, how can the service reset the passwords? There are so many scenarios where things can go wrong.</p>
<p>May be an idea like BlockEvent were never meant to be invented.</p>
<p><strong>The currently hyped up technology may not be ideal for your system and instead a time tested solution may be the answer that you’re looking for.</strong></p>
<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>When it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, I’m still open minded, at the same time but skeptical. I’m not yet ready to invest or build something on blockchain.</p>
<p>I still find it difficult to fully understand the idea of blockchain, what makes it different from a decentralized git repository? Why Git is easy to implement but blockchain is hard? </p>
<p>When it comes to BlockEvents, I think what they did was store the email and password both hashed on the blockchain, and when a user logs in, they match the submitted hashed email and hashed passwords against what’s stored in the blockchain, like we do it in a normal login system using a database, except the fact that we don’t hash the emails.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p><em>I’m not a blockchain expert, so I don’t know the exact reason why BlockEvent was not able to reset the passwords.</em></p>
<p><em>Was it because they didn’t know the emails because they were hashed, or was it because once you put some information to the blockchain it is immutable, or was it due to both?</em></p>
<p><em>At the time when I saw this in 2019, I thought it was due to the fact that data is immutable on the blockchain, but now at the time of writing I feel it was due to the fact that the emails were stored on the blockchain in hashed format.</em></p>
<p><em>I also don’t know what really caused so many people to lose their password, my assumption is that they used a throwaway password, or a new password which they forgot. But still this number of users getting locked out is still unexplained.</em></p>
<p><em>After further Googling I was able to find a mirror of the original website on another domain name http://blockevent.ml</em></p>
<p><em>I tried logging in using my BlockEvent account, but I also have forgotten my BlockEvent password, and now I’m also locked out.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Law enforcement wiretapped the very service used by criminals to evade interception</p><div><p>The virtual private network (VPN) Safe-Inet used by the world’s foremost cybercriminals has been taken down yesterday in a coordinated law enforcement action led by the German Reutlingen Police Headquarters together with Europol and law enforcement agencies from around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Safe-Inet service was shut down and its infrastructure seized in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and the United States. The servers were taken down, and a splash page prepared by Europol was put up online after the domain seizures. This coordinated takedown was carried out in the framework of the <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/empact">European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Turning the table on the criminals&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Active for over a decade, Safe-Inet was being used by some of the world’s biggest cybercriminals, such as the ransomware operators responsible for ransomware, E-skimming breaches and other forms of serious cybercrime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This VPN service was sold at a high price to the criminal underworld as one of the best tools available to avoid law enforcement interception, offering up to 5 layers of anonymous VPN connections.</p>
<p>Law enforcement were able to identify some 250 companies worldwide which were being spied on by the criminals using this VPN. These companies were subsequently warned of an imminent ransomware attack against their systems, allowing them to take measures to protect themselves against such an attack.<br>
The service has now been rendered inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigations are ongoing in a number of countries to identify and take action against some of Safe-Inet’s users. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>International cyber sweep&nbsp;</h3>
<p>International police cooperation was central to the success of this investigation as the critical infrastructure was scattered across the world.</p>
<p>Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) </a>supported the investigation from the onset, bringing together all the involved countries to establish a joint strategy and to organise the intensive exchange of information and evidence needed to prepare for the final phase of the takedown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Police President of the Reutlingen Police Headquarters, Udo Vogel</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The investigation carried out by our cybercrime specialists has resulted in such a success thanks to the excellent international cooperation with partners worldwide. The results show that law enforcement authorities are equally as well connected as criminals.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, Edvardas Šileris</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &nbsp;strong working relationship fostered by Europol between the investigators involved in this case on either side of the world was central in bringing down this service. &nbsp;Criminals can run but they cannot hide from law enforcement, and we will continue working tirelessly together with our partners to outsmart them.</p>

            <!-- //category -->


            <p><a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/datafusion" title="DataFusion">DataFusion</a> is a new data processing engine written in the Rust programming language. It provides a SQL and a DataFrame API to transform datasets from multiple sources and in multiple file formats, similar to Spark. DataFusion uses <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/" title="Apache Arrow">Apache Arrow</a> as the underlying memory model, an efficient in-memory columnar format. This choice has significant performance benefits compared to a row-level representation such as used by <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" title="Apache Spark">Apache Spark</a>.</p>
<p>As other databases &amp; engines have shown, performing analytical (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing" title="OLAP">OLAP</a>) queries on a <a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2005/papers/P19.pdf" title="columnar rather than row-by-row format">columnar rather than row-by-row format</a> can significantly speed up query execution, often by 20x or more!  When processing is done row-by-row, a lot of complex operations are being executed in the inner loop when executing a query, such as interpreting an expression, computing the result and going to the next value in the row, dealing with completely different operations and data types. In contrast, when operating on a columnar level, the inner loop can be very simple, making it easy for the CPU to see what instructions will likely run next and utilize various forms of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism" title="instruction level parallelism">instruction level parallelism</a>. Modern CPUs can run hundreds of instructions at the same time, even on one core. Code can be written to use available <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD" title="SIMD">SIMD</a> instructions, operating at multiple inputs at the same time to speed up things even more.<img src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/simd.png" alt="Arrow Format" title="Arrow Format"></p>
<p><em>Image source: Arrow website</em></p>
<p>DataFusion is implemented in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" title="Rust">Rust</a>, a language that is both fast and has control over memory while still providing memory safety, making it a very suitable language to write performant and correct code. Compared to Java running on the JVM, systems written in Rust tend to use much less memory. This saves costs and makes it possible to run bigger workloads on a single machine! An earlier benchmark of <a href="https://ballistacompute.org/" title="Ballista">Ballista</a>, a distributed engine in Rust utilizing DataFusion, <a href="https://andygrove.io/rust_bigdata_benchmarks/" title="shows">shows</a> that it can do with about 10x less memory on small to medium sized datasets. The JVM needs at least 1 GB for the heap. Spark also keeps intermediate results in memory between stages. DataFusion can stream more in batches of records, keeping memory usage low. DataFusion also benefits from Arrow format, which stores data types such as strings in an efficient way.</p>
<p>Numerous performance improvements have been added in the Rust version of Arrow and DataFusion between version 2 and 3 which is planned for release in January.<br>
For example, I have contributed a<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8781" title=" faster CSV parser"> faster CSV parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8863" title="improved">improved</a> the performance of <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8832" title="hashing">hashing</a>. Kernels have been improved that provide implementations of often-used calculations, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8800" title="sum">sum</a>, filter, <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8803" title="taking multiple elements">taking multiple elements</a> of an array by index (also called indexing or gathering), and <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8837" title="more">more</a>. As DataFusion and Arrow are relatively new projects, there is still a lot of room for further improvement.</p>
<p>Recently, I <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8961" title="added a new optimization pass to">added a new optimization pass to</a> DataFusion to make hash joins faster. A hash join is a popular algorithm to implement joins in a fast way. The hash join algorithm is divided in a <em>build</em> stage and a <em>probe</em> stage. The <em>build</em> (or left side) stage creates a lookup table to map the keys in the join condition to a row index. The <em>probe</em> (right side) stage looks up the items in the lookup table by key and adds the matching rows to the end result if there is a match.<br>
It is faster to create a lookup table for the smallest table. This will avoid work for creating the lookup table for more rows, as well as not having the requirement to keep the bigger table in memory. For the optimization to be possible, we need to know the number of rows of both sources before executing the query. Luckily, for Parquet and in-memory tables this can be calculated based on the metadata. This information has been exposed recently in DataFusion.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-results">Implementation / Results</h4>
<p>The optimization is implemented as an optimization pass on the logical plan, an abstract representation of a query. When the left side of a join has more rows than the right side, the order and join type are swapped. If the left side already is smaller, the order is kept intact.<br>
While testing the optimization something unexpected happened: When the optimization rule was used to change the order, the query performed worse than the original.<br>
While studying the implementation of the hash join in DataFusion, it became clear that next to the left side of a join, the right part creates a lookup table as well!<br>
I <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8965" title="changed the implementation">changed the implementation</a> to only use the probe side to look up items on the left side and simplified the implementation, removing some other inefficiencies. Now queries having joins run much faster than before. This can be demonstrated on two <a href="http://www.tpc.org/tpch/" title="TCP-H">TCP-H</a> benchmark queries that include a join and are supported in DataFusion. Notably, TCP-H 5 is now 16x faster and TCP-H 12 more than 4 times faster.<br>
I ran the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/benchmarks" title="TPC-H">TPC-H</a> benchmarks using the command: <code>cargo run  --release --bin tpch -- benchmark --iterations 10 --path <location> --format tbl --query 12 --batch-size 20000 --concurrency 10 -m </location></code> and averaged the results.</p>
<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/improved_join-900x629.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When the optimization rule is applied and combined with the improved hash join implementation, it makes the queries where the rule can be applied run faster, in this case reducing the total execution time by about 16%. For more imbalanced joins, the speedup can be greater. The data contains roughly 6 million line items (originally on the left side of the join) and 1.5 million orders (on the right side).</p>
<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/carbon-7-900x834.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/join_build_probe_order-900x542.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Statistics are a promising way to accelerate queries. In the future, a lot more optimizations could be added that benefit from table statistics. Many statistics however are known only after queries run, so in the future it would be interesting to add a form of <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/05/29/adaptive-query-execution-speeding-up-spark-sql-at-runtime.html" title="Adaptive Query Execution">Adaptive Query Execution</a> as well.<br>
Hash joins could be further improved, for example by using <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/vectorized-hash-joiner/" title="vectorized hashing">vectorized hashing</a>, which can also be used for hash aggregations which are used in GROUP BY queries.</p>
<p>I am personally very excited for what the future of Arrow and DataFusion brings and making Rust and Apache Arrow accelerate data analytics &amp; data science.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The first hearing in the court case of German-Swiss media empire Ringier Axel Springer against Polish journalist Witold Gadowski was set to take place in the regional court of Warsaw Provincial court of Warsaw but was postponed due to security concerns after up to 100 of Gadowski's supporters showed up in court. </p><div><p>Axel Springer SE is the largest digital publishing house in Europe, controlling two of Germany's largest news brands, Bild and Die Welt. In Poland, it's the publisher of country's largest tabloid "Fakt" and one of the largest weeklies "Newsweek" as well as the largest newsportal Onet.pl.</p>

<p>The media group sued Gadowski for his statement in which he claimed that the company, founded in 1946, was from the outset linked to people from the Wehrmacht, the SS and Gestapo, while the company’s founder, Axel Springer, was himself involved with the Nazi regime”. In response, the media group Gadowski for infringement of personal interests.</p>

<p>Axel Springer, born in 1912 worked as an editor in his father's newspaper "Altonaer Nachrichter". After Hitler came to power in 1933, the paper participated in the anti-Jewish progaganda campaign directed against the German Jewish community. He was also a member of the Nazi paramilitary organization "The National Socialist Motor Corps". Another stain on his legacy was his decision to abandon his half-Jewish wife Martha Else Meyer, who just had given birth to their first child, soon after the Nurnberg laws came into force and remarrying with an "Aryan" woman.</p>

<p>Witold Gadowski told the media present for the hearing that he hopes that justice will prevail and that the proceeding will be on the grounds of the Polish law, where the constitution guarantees the Polish journalists’ freedom of speech. He also underlined that Axel Ringer Springer is trying to infringe on that exact freedom of speech by taking him to court.</p>

<p>The judge was surprised by the number of people who appeared in the court to support Gadowski and postponed the hearing due to safety concerns.</p>

<p>According to Gadowski, the case filed against him by Axel Springer could first step on the road to restoring the faith in the media in Poland. The columnist said that he still has faith and believes that facts and the truth will be enough to win the case.</p>

<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

                    <hr> 
                    <p>The web is thirty years old this month, counting from the date the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/08/history-of-the-web/origins.htm">first web server was launched on Christmas 1990</a>. Personally, August 6th, 1991, is more significant, when the web was publicly announced.</p>

<p>In 1991 I was writing for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> magazine, which was a lot of fun, because I got to work with, and write about, people who were doing fascinating things with computer technology. Working for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> led to writing the book <em>Taking the Next Step</em> and a short stint at Steve Jobs’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> as a technical writer.</p>

<p>The most innovative project I encountered that year was not NeXT. Rather, it was something developed by Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory. He used a NeXT computer to develop a networked information system for high-energy physicists. If I hadn’t been reading  the <em>comp.sys.next</em> Usenet newsgroups carefully, I would have missed the announcement of a “a hypertext editor for the NeXT.”</p>

<p>Not many people used “WWWNeXTStepEditor version 0.12.” The NeXT community was small and many NeXT computer users did not yet have Internet access, which was required to access Tim Berners-Lee’s experimental “WorldWideWeb” documents. To me, the name WorldWideWeb seemed a bit of a conceit since the only users at the time were high-energy physicists at a few research institutes.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, as soon I’d installed and tried the software, I wanted to get involved. I told everyone about it, including a fellow editor at <em>NeXTWORLD,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>. Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, and cofounder of the (then-new) Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor">Mitch Kapor</a>…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-barlow.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you don’t recognize Barlow’s references, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Project Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a> was a visionary hypertext project that predated the Internet. The Matrix is not the movie universe created by the Wachowskis but, rather the network of computer networks that existed before the commercialization of the Internet (as described by the researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quarterman">John Quarterman</a>).</p>

<p>Subsequently I joined the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0001.html">www-talk mailing list</a> and also contacted Tim Berners-Lee directly. I wanted to know if he was interesting in technology I’d heard about from friends at Adobe Systems. Adobe’s editable PostScript specification (which came to be named PDF and became the basis for a product named “Acrobat”) seemed to me a better match for distributed hypertext than the very-limited SGML-based “HTML tags” that Tim Berners-Lee was using. HTML offered only minimal layout and styling possibilities; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> was a better page description language.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-timbl.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee was reluctant to publicize that code for the web was available for free, as management at CERN had not yet agreed to release it publicly (that didn’t happen until <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399">April 1993</a>), and I wasn’t able to write about it for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> (too bad, as I could have been the first journalist to write about the web!).</p>

<p>Subsequently, editable PostScript was released, and in 1993, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> of CERN visited me in California. I arranged a meeting between Cailliau and management at Adobe Systems. He met with John Kunze of Adobe at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and demonstrated the World Wide Web — the first time management at Adobe had seen the Web. By that time, HTML was firmly entrenched as the native language of the new Web. Adobe later invested in Netscape Communications and produced an Acrobat plug-in for the Netscape Web browser, establishing the basis for viewing richly formatted PDF pages in web browsers.</p>

<p>For some years afterward, I regretted that the Adobe/WWW meeting had not taken place the previous year, because the sparse and limited HTML format might have been eclipsed by the richer format of PDF as the primary syntax of web pages. With the adoption of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/">Cascading Style Sheets specification</a> (from 1999 forward), my views changed, and I’ve come to appreciate that the technical underpinnings of the web are optimal, reflecting both the genius of Berners-Lee’s original vision and the rich contributions of the worldwide developer community.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, it is easy to overlook the web’s origins as a tool for sharing knowledge. Key to Tim Berners-Lee’s vision were open standards that reflected his belief in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower">Rule of Least Power</a>, a principle that choosing the simplest and least powerful language for a given purpose allows you to do more with the data stored in that language (thus HTML is easier for humans or machines to interpret and analyze than PostScript). Along with open standards and the Rule of Least Power, Tim Berners-Lee wanted to make it easy for anyone to publish information in the form of web pages. His first web browser, named Nexus, was both a browser and editor. The NeXTSTEP SDK made editing easy to implement; editing was abandoned in subsequent non-NeXT web browsers.</p>

<p>I think we’ve lost sight of that original vision. Facebook or Wix make it easy to author web pages but at the cost of lock-in to proprietary systems. And when developers choose complex software such as React or Rails to build simple websites, I cringe at the violation of Rule of Least Power. I still have a “deep case of net religion” (as John Perry Barlow said in 1991) and I’m now writing about ways to build websites without frameworks and build tools (see my articles, <a href="https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/build-websites-the-yax-way/index.html">Build Websites the Yax Way</a>). My current project, <a href="https://yax.com/">Yax.com</a>, is a do-it-yourself website builder that uses new web standards (including web components) to help people build simple sites. Thirty years on, we still have a lot of work to do to realize the web’s original goals. I hope I’m not the only one who sees this.</p>

<p>I never anticipated that Berners-Lee’s NeXT hypertext project would become a medium to supplant print and television. In 1991, during idle moments, I imagined the world’s books and magazines might be reborn as hypertext (many others had imagined this earlier, including Ted Nelson, with his Xanadu project). But I never honestly believed that Berners-Lee’s software project could change the world. By 1999, as Web addresses appeared on billboards and the sides of buses, I started to accept that Berners-Lee naming his project “the WorldWide Web” was not vainglorious but simply prescient. Still, I hope his original vision of the web as a means for sharing the world’s knowledge is not eclipsed by its utility as a platform for commerce.</p>

    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
<li>If you can use the gathering to bootstrap a group chat or community, so much the better!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>

<p>As financial services firms evaluate the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI), for example: to enhance the customer experience and garner operational efficiencies,&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) Risk and Security&nbsp;(“AIRS”)<span><a href="https://ai.wharton.upenn.edu/artificial-intelligence-risk-governance/#_ftn1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;is committed to furthering this dialogue and has drafted the following overview discussing AI implementation and the corresponding potential risks firms may wish to consider in formulating their AI strategy. This white paper provides AIRS’s views on potential approaches to AI governance for financial services including potential risks, risk categorization, interpretability, discrimination, and risk mitigation, in particular, as applied to the financial industry.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>This paper is intended for discussion purposes only and is not intended to serve as a prescriptive roadmap for implementing AI/ML tools or as a comprehensive inventory of risk associated with the use of AI. Readers are encouraged to consider the information provided in this paper for reference and discussion purposes. They should assess, implement, and tailor their firms’ AI/ML programs and respective controls as appropriate for their business model, product and service mix, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>The views expressed in this paper are those of the individual contributors and do not constitute the views of any of the firms with which the contributors are associated or by which they are employed.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>AIRS believes there are significant potential benefits of AI and that its adoption within financial services presents opportunities to improve both business and societal outcomes when risks are managed responsibly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This paper explores the potential risks of AI and provides a standardized practical categorization of these risks: Data Related Risks, AI/ML Attacks, Testing and Trust, and Compliance</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>AI governance frameworks could help organizations learn, govern, monitor, and mature AI adoption. Four core components of AI governance are: definitions, inventory, policy/standards, and a governance framework, including controls.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>AI, in certain use cases, could lead to privacy issues, and/or potentially discriminatory or unfair outcomes, if not implemented with appropriate care. We explore, in detail, the subject of interpretability and discrimination in using AI for certain use cases.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, practices institutions might consider adopting to mitigate AI risk include oversight and monitoring, enhancing explainability and interpretability, as well as exploring the use of evolving risk-mitigating techniques like differential privacy, and watermarking, among others.</p>
	</li>
</ul>



<h4>AIRS Next Steps</h4>

<p>This document is meant to be the first of several iterations and further contributions from the AIRS group. These insights are based on collective experience of AIRS, and the suggestions we outline are, as a result, not meant to be comprehensive. AIRS plans to continue to build and engage an active community on these issues. Contact information is provided in Section 6 (Acknowledgments) if there is any feedback or if readers wish to comment on this paper or AIRS.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h2><span>1. Overview</span></h2>

<h4>1.1 Document Purpose &amp; Scope</h4>

<p>The business uses, regulatory interest and research in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have seen an exponential increase over the last few years. Discussions regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have gained momentum as financial services firms evaluate the potential applications of AI, including for example: to enhance the customer experience and garner operational efficiencies. AIRS is committed to furthering this dialogue and has drafted the following overview addressing the use of AI within financial services, discussing AI implementation and the corresponding potential risks firms may wish to consider in formulating their AI strategy. Our hope is to contribute to and establish an industry-wide view of the potential risks and mitigants in this rapidly evolving domain of AI/ML, as they may apply to individual firms depending on their use of AI systems.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>In this document, AIRS members present their views, guidance, and a structure for conceiving AI/ML risks and governance, drawing upon our combined experience implementing and managing technology risks in the financial sector. The views expressed in this paper are meant to assist individuals and organizations facing risks and governance challenges presented by AI/ML. However, it is critical that each institution assess its own AI uses, risk profile and risk tolerance and design governance frameworks that fit their unique circumstances. As such, this paper is not meant to be comprehensive or prescriptive.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h4>1.2 AIRS</h4>

<p>AIRS is an informal group of practitioners and academics from varied backgrounds, including technology risk, information security, legal, privacy, architects, model risk management, and others working for financial, technology organizations, and academic institutions. The AIRS working group, based in New York, was initiated in early 2019 and has grown to nearly 40 members from dozens of institutions (and continues to grow).</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>The AIRS Working Group seeks to promote, educate, and advance AI/ML governance for the financial services industry by focusing on risk identification, categorization, and mitigation.</p>

<h4>1.3 Definitions &amp; Assumptions</h4>

<p>We use several terms throughout this document specific to AI/ML, some of which are subject to vigorous discussions and debates in the research community. Because this document attempts to form a starting point for broader AI/ML governance and risk management efforts, we purposely leverage and encourage readers to refer to various papers for the definition of AI. As such, we note that specific definitions should be (and generally are) tailored to each organization depending on the scope, risk appetite, internal structure, culture, and implementation details of AI/ML efforts.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>While there is no universally accepted definition of AI, it is generally understood to refer to “a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers, or the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.” Generally, machine learning is referred to as, “a field of computer science that uses algorithms to process large amounts of data and learn from it.”<span><a href="https://ai.wharton.upenn.edu/artificial-intelligence-risk-governance/#_ftn2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;The term AI is broadly used and typically includes aspects of machine learning and natural language processing. For purposes of this paper, the focus is largely on the use of and potential risks related to machine learning, though the overarching discussion applies more broadly to the abovementioned areas.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h4>1.4 A Brief Note on AI/ML Uses and Benefits</h4>

<p>The use of AI in financial institutions is increasing as technological barriers have fallen and its benefits and potential risks have become clearer. The Financial Stability Board recently highlighted four areas where AI could impact banking specifically.<span><a href="https://ai.wharton.upenn.edu/artificial-intelligence-risk-governance/#_ftn3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;First, customer-facing uses could expand access to credit and other financial services. For example, combining expanded consumer data sets with new ML algorithms to assess credit quality or price insurance policies, and using AI to offer new and innovative channels to deliver financial services could be a potent way to advance financial inclusion. Also, the use of AI chatbots could provide help and even financial advice to consumers, saving them time they might otherwise waste while waiting to speak with a live operator. Second, there is the potential for strengthening back-office operations, such as advanced models for capital optimization, model risk management, stress testing, and market impact analysis. Third, AI approaches could be applied to trading and investment strategies, from identifying new signals on price movements to using past trading behavior to anticipate a client’s next order. Finally, there are likely to be AI advancements in compliance and risk mitigation by banks. AI solutions are already being used by some firms in areas like fraud detection, capital optimization, and portfolio management.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Several papers and articles describe the potential uses and benefits of AI adoption and innovation in financial services. Widespread AI/ML adoption within the financial services industry could provide a unique opportunity to significantly improve financial outcomes for consumers and businesses, if this is done responsibly. That is why AIRS has chosen to focus this paper on understanding and managing the potential risks of AI/ML so that those benefits may be realized.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h2>2<span>. AI Risks and Risk Categorization</span></h2>

<p>Key potential risks of AI relate to potential harms that may affect organizations, consumers, or create broader detrimental effects on society. Such potential risks may arise in whole or in part from sources including the data used to train the AI system; potential risks arising from the AI system itself; potential risks arising from the usage of the AI system; and potential risks arising from poor overall governance of the AI system.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h4>2.1 Risk Categorization</h4>

<p>Various research papers, articles, and discussions have covered the topics of risks associated with AI. It is up to individual financial services firms to categorize potential risks of using AI: however, we have included a suggested approach to AI risk categorization in the financial services industry below.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>The areas of data related risks, AI/ML attacks, testing and trust, as well as people risk constitute potential areas of risk, which could be subcategorized as illustrated in&nbsp;Figure 1.&nbsp;We address these sub-categories in further detail below.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>It’s important to note that the applicability and relevance of risks illustrated in Figure 1 are dependent on an individual organization’s risk profile, appetite, and existing controls, and it is up to each firm to determine whether …</span></p></div></div>

This security innovation uses two dimensional (2-D)-material tags and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled authentication software.</p><figure></figure><p><i>Video:&nbsp;“Anti-counterfeiting tech by NUS researchers does reliable AI authentication under extreme conditions” by&nbsp;National University of Singapore, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fz5zwmqfeQ_Y&amp;t=OTNjOGIzNjRlODBkM2Q5MzUzZjNmNDQ0OTFlNmM1ZDU4ZGVkNmM5MSxsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032724">YouTube</a>.</i></p><p>Compared to conventional anti-counterfeiting technologies, <i>DeepKey</i> works faster, achieves highly accurate results, and uses durable identification tags that are not easily damaged by environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures, chemical spills, UV exposure, and moisture. This new authentication technology can be applied to different high-value products, ranging from drugs, jewellery, and electronics. For example, <i>DeepKey</i> is suitable for tagging COVID-19 vaccines to enable rapid and reliable authentication, as some of such vaccines need to be stored at the ultra-cold temperature of -70°C.</p><p>Led by Asst Prof Chen Po-Yen and Asst Prof Wang Xiaonan from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NUS Faculty of Engineering, the team’s 2D-material secure tags exhibit Physically Unclonable Function patterns (PUF patterns), which are randomly generated by systematically crumpling the 2D-material thin films. The complex 2D-material patterns with multi-scale features can then be classified and validated by a well-trained deep learning model, enabling reliable (100 per cent accurate) authentication in less than 3.5 minutes.</p><p>Current anti-counterfeiting technologies using PUF patterns normally face several bottlenecks, including complicated manufacturing, specialised and tedious readout process, long authentication time, insufficient environmental stability, as well as being costly to make.</p><p>“With this research, we have tackled several bottlenecks that other techniques encounter,” said Asst Prof Wang. “Our 2D-material PUF tags are environmentally stable, easy to read, simple and inexpensive to make. In particular, the adoption of deep learning accelerated the overall authentication significantly, pushing our invention one step further to practical application.”</p><p>The researchers published their results in scientific journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS2590238520305592&amp;t=NGI4Mzk4ZTVmYTQwN2Q3NTliMDUxNzc4ODljMWEyNjEwZGI1OTY0Zixsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032724"><i>Matter</i></a> on 2 December 2020. This study was conducted in collaboration with researchers from Anhui University of Technology and Nanyang Technological University.</p><h2><b>A stable, simple, and scalable process to create PUF tags</b></h2><p>Remarkably, the researchers do not need any special equipment to create the secure tags. They can simply be made with a balloon, a bottle of 2D-material dispersion, and a brush.</p><p>“First, we inflate the balloon and brush over its surface with viscous 2D-material ink. After air-drying overnight, we deflate the balloon. Because of the interfacial mechanical mismatch between the 2D-material and latex substrate, large-area, crumpled PUF patterns are generated during the contraction. These PUF patterns can be cut to the required size afterwards, and normally, hundreds of them can be made at one time,” said Dr Jing Lin, a member of the research team.</p><p>Next, the researchers take a quick image of the PUF tag with an electron microscope, which is then synced to their innovative software to go through the deep learning “classification and validation” process. “The whole process takes less than 3.5 minutes, most of which is spent waiting for the readout from the electron microscope. The authentication itself is very fast, in less than 20 seconds,” explained Dr Jing.</p><figure data-orig-width="2880" data-orig-height="1620"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/32922ca933e0580cc4e864cde80d8ebc/c63a4c8653de1bfd-38/s1280x1920/10ec3b7e954e357ad6da471ea33a0a91997626cc.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2880" data-orig-height="1620" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;A stable, simple, and scalable process to create PUF tags.

However, the high encoding capacity also leads to long authentication time, as the “search and compare” pattern validation has to be conducted within a huge database. This trade-off between high encoding capacity and long authentication time often restricts such PUF-based anti-counterfeiting tags from practical applications.</p><p>“With our new technology, we are breaking this long-lasting trade-off between high encoding capacity and long authentication time by using classifiable 2D-material PUF tags and deep learning algorithms,” said Asst Prof Wang.</p><p>First, the researchers used various 2D materials to fabricate PUF tags with AI recognisable features. Second, they trained a deep learning model to conduct a two-step authentication mechanism. “We used the deep learning model to pre-categorise the PUF patterns into subgroups, and so the search-and-compare algorithm is conducted in a much smaller database, which shortens the overall authentication time,” Asst Prof Wang explained.</p><p>Currently, the only available technologies similar to this NUS innovation, are polymer wrinkle-based tags. Wrinkled polymer tags are authenticated based on the surface patterns just like the novel 2D-material tags. However, their authentication presently requires one-by-one feature extraction and matching, which is slow and shows only 80 per cent reliability. The NUS team’s authentication is boosted by deep learning, and is therefore much faster, and reaches nearly 100 per cent validation precision.</p><p>In addition, compared to the wet chemistry preparation of polymer wrinkle-based tags, which involves the use of harmful organic chemicals and UV light, the NUS researchers’ fabrication technique is significantly faster and safer.</p><h2><b>Next steps</b></h2><p>The NUS team has filed a patent for their invention and is now planning to push this technology one step further. “We are searching for better, faster, and more robust readout and authentication approaches for our PUF tags,” said Asst Prof Wang.</p><p>The team has already begun to conduct research on other readout techniques to further shorten the processing time. “In addition, such naturally encoded information by the PUF tags could be further secured by being kept on blockchain, so that the whole supply chain and quality control can be transparently tracked,” Asst Prof Wang added.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.nus.edu.sg%2Freliable-anti-counterfeit-checks-under-extreme-conditions%2F&amp;t=NDU5ZTE4ZDc1YzFhZDFjN2QzYzExZDUwMzA0NjhlODUwNjFjM2NjZCxsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609032724">National University of Singapore</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“
