<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 17 Jul 2020</p>
<h2 id="optimal-lecture-time"><a href="#optimal-lecture-time">Optimal Lecture Time</a></h2>

<p>
I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten Lessons I
Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk presented by
Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>

<blockquote>
Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove
the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of
lectures.
</blockquote>

<p>
That's fine advice. In fact, the whole article is full of good advice
like this. Although it was written primarily for mathematicians, a lot
of what is said in the article applies quite well to professionals in
other fields too.
</p>

<p>
The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how long a
microcentury is. It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could it?
</p>


<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury"><a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury</a></h2>
<p>
The English Wiktionary entry for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
(as of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and 34 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Not a standard unit of measurement, and used mostly humorously to denote
the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>

<p>
This looks incorrect to me. This is based on the oversimplified
assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes that
a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly 365 days.
If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed it would have
3 153 600 000 seconds and one millionth of it would be
3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52 minutes 33.6 seconds. This
looks consistent with the Wiktionary entry. However, an actual century
on the calendar does not have exactly 36500 days. Some years are leap
years, so the actual number of days in a century is more than that.
</p>


<h2 id="assumptions"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>
Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as possible. We
will count the leap years. We will ignore leap seconds because they are
irregularly spaced and unpredictable. We will also ignore the following
gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep 1752 when the British Empire switched
from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar:
</p><pre><samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code> command
as shown above on a Unix or Linux system. Ignoring this gap is
equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian calender
since the year 1 AD.
</p>

<p>
We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
year</em>. Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year begins a
new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the current
century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to 2099. The
computation presented in the next section works equally well for any
span of 100 years.
</p>


<h2 id="computation"><a href="#computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is, a
year that is a multiple of 100. A centurial year is a leap year <em>if
and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400. Apart from the centurial
year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years that are multiples of 4
and these are all leap years. From these facts, we can conclude that a
span of 100 years contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days. In other words,
a century has either 3 155 673 600 seconds or
3 155 760 000 seconds. Here is a
quick demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 100, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output of this program:
</p>

<pre><samp>0001-0101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0201-0301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0301-0401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0401-0501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0501-0601: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0601-0701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0701-0801: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0801-0901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0901-1001: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1001-1101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1101-1201: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1401: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1601: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1801: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2001: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds, that
is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one decimal
place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7 seconds.

<p>A ready-to-install jupyter extension which converts english queries into relevant code. Built as a proof of concept for the problem we personally face of <strong>forgetting less-used syntaxes of pandas and plotly libraries</strong> which is often used in Exploratory Data Analysis. This tool allows us to query in a generic language without having to remember the syntax.</p>

<p>Inspired by cool GPT-3 demos and not having the access to the API, here is an attempt by us to build a Text2Code extension using publicly available libraries. The approach isn't generative, but relies on identifying &amp; matching from a set of predefined <em>intents</em> and generating the relevant code by extracting relevant entities and inserting them in a template. Adding new intents and extending the functionality is easy once the pipeline is in place. </p>

<p>Granted, the usual stuff applies: Fast page load, responsiveness for mobile devices, spelling and grammer…still apply.</p>

<p>At this time, it is now better for you to write content like a human, with personality, and natural.</p>
<p>If you know a subject well, Google especially can sense that. If you are faking, google can sense that too.</p>
<p>Bing search engine likely has comparable talents. Other <em>search engines don’t even matter anymore</em>, as they (such as Duckduckgo and Yahoo) actually source their results from Bing.</p>
<p>Whereas domain authority was previously calculated by backlinks and social network queues, the algos can now sense from your writing alone, along with a multitude of other queues…if you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>On this subject, here is some light reading for you… <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf</a> (E-A-T)</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="backlinks-hardly-matter">Backlinks… Hardly Matter</h3>
<p>Before, in SEO, you had the burden of building backlinks. Backlinks helped search engines understand the context of your site and it’s possible popularity and authority.</p>
<p>This, too, was could be farmed artificially.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter now.</p>

<p>If I were to speak, talk, express myself to you in a awkward, silly, repetitive, redundant manner, you might not like, appreciate, understand me very well.</p>
<p>If I spoke to you with no less than 1000 words, you might be annoyed. You would, most likely, be very, annoyed, angered, frustrated, sad.</p>
<p>You get it? The Algorithms practically have emotions now. They don’t want to hear you talk like that either.</p>
<p>They don’t like SEO tricks.</p>
<p>Don’t use them.</p>
<hr>

<p>Unless you really are a popular person, don’t bother. Sure, social network traffic is great. But artificial popularity on a social network (ie, an army of admiring sock puppets talking about you… doesn’t help anymore). Search engines know who’s real and who’s not (mostly).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="finally-you-can-be-you">Finally, You Can Be You</h2>
<p>Now that search engines are smarter, you are officially relieved of the burden of SEO. You can be your best you, and you will now thrive for it.</p>

    <p>In 2018, I started working at Bloomberg. Things have changed a lot since. I’m not the most junior member in the company anymore and I’ve mentored quite a few new engineers, which has been amazing. It helped me observe how others differ from me, absorb their best practices, and figure out things I’ve unconsciously been doing pretty well.</p>

<p>Yearly work reviews are a good way to condense these lessons I’ve learned.  They’re valuable for pattern matching, too. Only when I zoom out do certain patterns become visible. I can then <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/the-human-log.html">start tracking these patterns consciously</a>.</p>

<p>The broad theme for this year is zooming out and challenging the boundaries. It’s also about zooming in, and adding nuance to the sections from last year. It’s more fun if you’ve <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html">read last year’s review first</a>: You can then diff my growth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It all began with a question: How do I grow further?</p>

<h2 id="growing-using-different-ladders-of-abstraction">Growing using different ladders of abstraction</h2>

<p>Entering my second year, I had all the basics in place. I had picked all the low hanging fruit, and my rate of growth slowed down. Not good. The big question in my mind was “How do I grow further?”</p>

<p>There was only so much I could do to improve my coding skills. Most blogs epousing techniques to write cleaner code, repeating yourself, not repeating yourself, etc. are micro-optimisations. Almost none of them would make me instantly impactful.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>However, I did figure out something insightful. I’m working inside the software development lifecycle, but this lifecycle is part of a bigger lifecycle: the product and infrastructure development lifecycle. I decided to go broader instead of deeper. Surprisingly, the breadth provided more depth to what I knew.</p>

<p>I zoomed out in 3 broad directions: learning what people around me are doing, learning good habits of mind, and acquiring new tools for thought.</p>

<h2 id="learning-what-people-around-me-are-doing">Learning what people around me are doing</h2>

<p>Since we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. In the end it’s a business making money through products. The goal isn’t to write code, it’s to be a profitable business.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Most big companies aren’t doing just one thing, which means there are different paths to making money in the same company. Everyone is on at least one path - if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> Tracking these paths, and the path I’m on was pretty valuable. It helped me see how I matter, and what levers I can pull to become more effective. Sometimes, it’s about making the sales jobs easier, so they can make more sales. Other times, it’s about building a new feature for clients. And some other times, it’s about improving a feature that keeps breaking.</p>

<p>Product managers are the best source for this. They know how the business makes money, who are the clients, and what do clients need.</p>

<p>Over the year, I setup quite a few meetings with everyone on my path. A second benefit this gave me was the context of other’s jobs. It helped me communicate better. Framing things in the right way is powerful.</p>

<p>For example, one conversation helped me appreciate why Sarah in Sales wants a bulk update tool. Some companies have lots of employees, and  updating them one by one is a pain. The code I write would literally ease Sarah’s pain.</p>

<!-- More recently, I got a chance to sit in on a few product scoping meetings between teams. This gave me a lot more appreciation for the job my PM and TLs do. Communication is surprisingly hard, and aligning different teams takes skill. -->

<!-- Force multiplier in team vs force multiplier in the entire chain. -->

<h2 id="learning-good-habits-of-mind">Learning good habits of mind</h2>

<p>Software engineering entails thinking well and making the right decisions. Programming is implementing those decisions.</p>

<p>A habit of mind is something your brain does regularly. This could be thinking of X whenever you see Y happen, or applying thinking tool X to problem Y. In short, habits of mind facilitate better thinking.</p>

<p>I suspected if I learn the general skill, I should be able to apply it better to software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-well">Thinking Well</h3>

<p>Software engineering is an excellent field to practice thinking well in. The feedback loops are shorter, and gauging correctness doesn’t take too long.</p>

<p>I dived into cognitive science studies. It’s a permanent skill that’s worth exploring - a force multiplier for whatever I end up doing, and pays dividends throughout my life. One output was <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html">a framework for critical thinking</a>. It’s compounding, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">and compounding is powerful</a>.</p>

<p>There’s lots of good things that came out of this, which I’ll talk about in a bit. They deserve their own section.</p>

<h3 id="strategies-for-making-day-to-day-more-effective">Strategies for making day-to-day more effective</h3>

<p>The other side of the coin is habits that allow you to think well. It starts with noticing little irritations during the day, inefficiencies in meetings, and then figuring out strategies to avoid them. These strategic improvements are underrated.</p>

<p>You decide what to do, and then let it run on automatic, freeing up the brain to think of more fun stuff. Of course, that’s what a habit is, too.</p>

<p>Some good habits I’ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never leave a meeting without making the decision / having a next action</li>
  <li>Decide who is going to get it done. Things without an owner rarely get done.</li>
  <li>Document design decisions made during a project</li>
</ul>

<p>This pattern became visible during the review, so I’m keen to pay attention and collect more strategies next year. Having an excellent scrum master who holds me accountable has helped me get better at following these strategies.</p>



<p>New tools for thought are related to thinking well, but more specific to software engineering. Tools for thought help me think better about specific engineering problems.</p>

<p>I’ve adopted a just-in-time approach to this. I look for new tools only when I get stuck on something, or when I find out my abstractions and design decisions aren’t working well.</p>

<p>For example, I was recently struggling with a domain with lots of complex business logic. Edge cases were the norm, and we wanted to design a system that handles this cleanly. That’s when I read about <a href="https://amzn.to/2FdCYUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Driven Design</a><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25">5</a></sup>. I could instantly put it to practice and make a big difference. Subsequently, I grasped these concepts better. I acquired a new mental model of how to create enterprise software.</p>

<p>The second way I keep learning and acquiring new mental models is via reading what surfaces on Hacker News. They are interesting ideas, some of which I’ve put to practice, but this is a lot less effective than the technique above. The only reason I still do this is to <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#map-and-the-territory">map the territory</a> - it keeps me aware of techniques that exist, so when I face a problem, I know there’s a method that might help.</p>

<p>The final way I acquire better mental models is by learning new diverse languages. The diversity bit is important. Learning yet another dialect of lisp has a lot less benefit than say, learning C++03, a functional programming language, a dynamic typed language, and a lisp. Today, <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J seems interesting</a>, and one I might consider learning. It’s a thinking model I haven’t used before.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten lots of value from doing this. Each language has its own vocabulary and grammar, and <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/vocabulary-mental-model.html">vocabulary is a meta-mental model</a>. It’s a new lens to look at how to do things.</p>

<p>When memory management is in your control, you understand how pointers and allocators work. When Python then abstracts this away, you appreciate the complexity reduction. When maps and filters in a functional language show up, you appreciate how Python’s for loops can be improved. Indeed, that’s what list comprehensions are. And then you notice how some things are easier with object oriented programming. There’s no one magic tool that fits everything well. And then you understand that despite this, you don’t have to switch tools. You can adapt best practices from one into another to solve your problems: like writing functional javascript. It’s the principles that matter more than their expression.</p>

<p>Broadly, that’s all I did this year. What follow are insights that sprang forth thanks to zooming out.</p>

<h2 id="protect-your-slack">Protect your slack</h2>

<p>When I say slack, I don’t mean the company, but the adjective.</p>

<p>One thing that gives me high output and productivity gains is to “slow down”. Want to get more done? Slow down.</p>

<p>Caveats apply, but here’s what I mean:</p>

<p>I’ve noticed people rush to solve problems. It can be something they’ve done before, or something we have a template for. It feels pretty good to smash through things. I’ve done that before, too! However, there’s very specific cases where this makes sense.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Whenever I’m working on something new, I take the time to learn things about the system I’m working on, and things closely related to it. If it’s too massive, I optimise for learning as much as I can. Every time I revisit the system, I aim to learn more.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is slack</a>, you get a chance to experiment, learn, and think things through. This means you get enough time to get things done.</p>

<p>When there is no slack, deadlines are tight, and all your focus goes into getting shit done.</p>

<p>Protecting your slack means not letting deadlines wrap tight around you. Usually, this is as simple (or hard) as communicating.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Slack might have a negative connotation with “slackers”, but protecting slack is a super power. It’s a long term investment into building yourself up at the cost of short term efficiency.</p>

<p>When I’m quickly dishing out stories, I also have a much harder time fixing bugs. I don’t take the time to create proper mental models of the system, which means my assumptions don’t match the code, and this mismatch is where most bugs lie.</p>

<p>I protect my slack, so I can take the time out to prioritise …</p></div></div>

	<section>
		<p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post was triggered/inspired by an article you can find <a href="https://thehftguy.com/2020/08/26/technical-debt-doesnt-exist/">here</a>. I strongly encourage you to get familiar with it - whatever I put below is built on it as a foundation, so all the kudos go to <strong>The HFT Guy</strong>.</em></p><hr><p>Mental models are extremely powerful thought constructs. They do guide &amp; simplify our reasoning, but they also prime us. Bias us. And when treated as axioms, dangerously narrow down our thinking horizons.</p><p>All of the above applies to the popular concept of <strong>"technical debt" (TD)</strong>. I won't cover its meaning and history (there are tons of online materials on those) - instead, I'd like to focus on why the concept of TD is far less useful than we tend to think and actually quite harmful for our daily work.</p><p>Why so? Mainly because:</p><ol><li>there's no code w/o technical debt - TD is <strong>a "local" maintainability factor</strong> (a multiplier - that can span from very low to extremely high values) for a particular piece of a system; hence it's not separable from good (/healthy) code; consider it an inevitable "property" of any code</li><li>mentally dividing work between "fixing/fighting TD" and "developing features" usually leads to: never doing anything about TD and just going short-cuts all the time (<em>"I'll just do it the quick'n'dirty style, we'll need to refactor all that anyway ... some day"</em>)</li><li>we tend to brand as TD <strong>everything "we don't like at the moment"</strong> (a code written by someone else, a code that uses a library we find passé atm, etc.) - which leads to several types of immature &amp; unprofessional practices and massive wastes ("lava flow" effect, stacking unnecessary abstractions, etc.)</li><li>for the reasons stated above, TD is highly subjective and prone to individual judgment, hence nearly impossible to reliably quantify &amp; measure (regardless of whether you estimate the cost of its reduction or its actual impact on the development process); but it looks like <strong>a great candidate for a universal excuse</strong> (and it's frequently used that way)</li><li>it conveniently puts engineers in "we VS the debt" mode by giving the common enemy (that won't speak up) - some ephemeral "entity" you can stand in opposition to; this detail is important: no-one ever openly admits to the ownership over the TD, it just pops up out of the thin air and hinders the work of poor engineers ...</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, peeling TD out of its name won't make all its negative consequences disappear, right? Naming it explicitly at least makes discussing it (among engineers) easier &amp; (hopefully) more conclusive.</p><p>But maybe there's a better way to tame it? E.g. by ...</p><ul><li>... treating it as something inevitable (as there's no and there'll never be perfect, debt-less code)</li><li>... containing it within component/element/unit boundaries</li><li>... and coming up with a way to "reset" it (once in a while) within those local boundaries?</li></ul><p>I've already written (over four years ago) about some particular concept that can help with that - <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/wiping-the-tech-debt-out-with-immutable-code/"><strong>the immutable code</strong></a>. It may sound weird at first glance, but apparently many companies adopt a similar standpoint:</p><ul><li>they create software with the EXPIRY date (on the level of module/component/piece) and re-create it every few years (because business/scale conditions do change anyway) - as a normal business-as-usual activity</li><li>they optimize not for "perfect architectures" but for future re-writes on the level of module/component/piece (e.g. by enforcing explicit contracts - so after a single component replacement, the whole system doesn't collapse like a house of cards)</li></ul><p>That's (creating with a re-write in mind) actually something I've already covered in <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/are-the-software-product-companies-doomed-to-collapse/"><strong>the different post in the past</strong></a>, so feel free to reach there for more details.</p><p>Great! But what if my system wasn't written in a re-write-friendly way? What if there are no explicit contracts, dependencies are out of control, the only units of abstractions are the language's syntactic constructs (a flat list, w/o hierarchy or varying perspectives) and it's not possible to map certain capabilities/duties?</p><p>HA! And now we've reached a conclusion I was looking for - the main pre-requisite to build a future-proof solution with a TAMEABLE technical debt is ... <strong>by doing a deliberate design</strong>. It can be done up-front or in an evolutionary way - the mode doesn't matter that much. The truly crucial elements are:</p><ul><li>capability-driven composition (driven by purpose, function) with explicit boundaries and dependencies</li><li>the ubiquitous language used everywhere</li><li>wide (expressive) but shallow (w/o internal details) contracts treated as a binding promise to all the consumers</li></ul><p>That's also why so many attempts to reduce technical debt by purely technical refactoring (e.g. splitting big classes, harmonizing conventions, simplifying the flow in complicated procedures) are a pure waste w/o any noticeable positive long-term effect.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><span>The creator of </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Ultimate-Component-Storage-System/" rel="nofollow">this project</a><span>, APTechnologies, came up with the idea for the storage cabinet by observing that he would run into trouble when organizing his component library. Rather than having to go across the workshop to get each part, he wanted a way to consolidate everything into one place for easy finding. The system works by first having the user search for a part on an adjacent screen, and then the associated bin will light up if the component is found in the system.</span></p><h3 id="toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><a href="#toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><i></i></a><span>Designing the Cabinet</span></h3><p>The storage solution is comprised of a 35 x 12 grid of drawers, which gives ample space for parts. The drawers are laid out according to the spacing between the LEDs in the strip (30 LEDs/meter). They are meant to be printed individually and then slotted in, plus they come in several different sizes.</p><h3 id="toc-fabrication-1"><a href="#toc-fabrication-1"><i></i></a><span>Fabrication</span></h3><p>Each drawer was 3D-printed on a Prusa Mk2S with PLA filament at a .2mm layer height. In order to minimize filament consumption, wall thicknesses are kept very thin, but even with this savings, 5kg of filament was required to fabricate the parts. There is also a small articulating arm that juts out from the side for the HDMI display.</p><h3 id="toc-software-2"><a href="#toc-software-2"><i></i></a><span>Software</span></h3><p>The primary way to interact with the system is through the terminal, which runs a Python 3 script. It begins by checking the text file for data integrity, where it then gets parsed and loaded into an object. Data is stored in CSV-style fashion, with the ID being the first column, the associated LEDs in the second, and finally the quantity in the third column. All subsequent values are optional and simply loaded by the user when the parts is located. A regex is used to parse the user's request, including searching for a component, changing its quantity, adding a new part, and removing a component.</p><h3 id="toc-electronics-3"><a href="#toc-electronics-3"><i></i></a><span>Electronics</span></h3><p>According to the project's creator, the choice for hardware components was quite straightforward. He used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B in conjunction with a generic HDMI monitor to show the command line interface. For power delivery, he opted for a simple 5V adapter to power both the Raspberry Pi 4 and NeoPixel strip. Since the Pi outputs 3.3v signals from its GPIO pins, a level-shifter is needed, in this case a 74AHCT125. There is an option to use an Arduino Uno via UART if the NeoPixel strip is too unreliable, since the Arduino Uno can supply stricter timings.</p><h3 id="toc-usage-4"><a href="#toc-usage-4"><i></i></a><span>Usage</span></h3><p><span>To add a new part, the command </span><code>PI&lt;ledn&gt;:PI&lt;ledn+k&gt;, &lt;quantity&gt;[, optional parameters]:add</code><span> is sent, which adds a new component to the library. Other commands such as ID&lt;id number&gt; (search for part by ID) and ID&lt;id number&gt;:rm (remove part with that ID) exist to manage added components in the library.</span></p><h3 id="toc-possible-additions-5"><a href="#toc-possible-additions-5"><i></i></a><span>Possible Additions</span></h3><p>Although the system works well for one place and a small collection of components, it tends to scale poorly when there's a large library or multiple users want to interact with it. One way to solve this issue is to replace the single text file with a relational database such as MySQL, where parts can be stored and indexed in a single table, and other data can be referenced. This gives a very powerful interface for the software to easily search, add, and modify parts without having to read and rewrite the text file constantly.</p></div></section><section></section><div><div><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236"></a><div><p><span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236">Arduino “having11” Guy</a><span></span></span></p><p>18 year-old IoT and embedded systems enthusiast.

<p>There is a huge gap between the benefits of Artificial Intelligence the public is being sold, the benefits of AI which are being marketed to corporate adopters, and the actual motivations of AI researchers.</p>



<ul><li>Tech providers pitch AI as a driver of innovation (self-driving cars) and global good (mitigating global warming).&nbsp; But the B2B case-studies pitched to corporate clients more often pitch AI solutions as <em>better automation, </em>mostly enabling cost-reduction (specifically, reducing human-in-the-loop labor).</li><li>While many AI researchers are motivated by genuine interest in improving the human condition, other motivations diverge — a desire to push the bounds of what we <em>can </em>do, a genuine belief in transhumanism (the desire for AI to replace, or transform into something entirely unrecognizable, humanity), or simply because AI pays bigly.</li></ul>



<p>These drivers — replacing human employment, and perhaps humans themselves — are, to put it mildly — not visions the public has bought into.</p>



<p>But these internal motivations are drowned out by the marketing AI pitch by which AI is sold to the public: “AI will solve [hunger/the environment/war/global warming]”.&nbsp; This leaves the people not “in the know” about AI progress — 99% of the population — not even <em>thinking </em>to use democracy to direct AI research towards a world the (average) person actually wants to live in.</p>



<p>This is not particularly fair.</p>



<p><strong>Marketed AI vs Profitable AI</strong></p>



<p>To the public, the tech giants selling AI solutions (Google, Microsoft, and Apple) pitch visions of AI <em>for good</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The public face of these advertising campaigns is usually brand advertising, perhaps pitching consumers on a software ecosystem (Android, iOS), but rarely selling any specific product.&nbsp; This makes it easy to sell the public a <em>vision </em>of the future in HDR, backed by inspirational hipster soundtracks.</p>



<p>You all know what I’m talking about — you’ve seen them on TV and in movie theaters — but the imagery is so<em> honed, </em>so <em>heroic, </em>that we should look at the pictures anyway.</p>



<p>Google’s AI will do revolutionary things, like fix farming, improve birthday parties, and help us not walk off cliffs:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jId-kNaiaBP0HNR6FjXXaS3HPKHoVr_tLUjEjjGS5sZ23IF1718IWzLeD719RSqO2Aj6vx3oDgeedE_Yjg5xcdNzl2IC71KP79uS0gUjyHSMEkLI1VALL8iqmwdhWXxTdGN7Qm2j" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s AI is safe.&nbsp; You can tell because this man is looking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5">very thoughtfully</a> into the distance:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JKMsdtPMVmd5PHVOAgCleWpG4WctVm-3rGxiM70Tg0HsmDgdxYysjqjGR_zn0I8SEs-lLQxpOyKqxFI_RioIuGDGUFMillFX4T7IxZPI6jHpNiQ10YWpCoodiWli-Z8IxlRVFxq4" alt=""></figure>



<p>But if that is not enough to convince you, here is a bird:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_NtL_Yy86NCoL4J_2kOpzAObYf9KTQ2D0i98JV4PnuAAE-yCqqAOXv7NGB_BSL8KJ-zBLGuiuqI5-fqmFkXLDVIONHPvvUWY6XWzjKC6D0LRaIVXjixdCWaidceDERUBRz-OyjP0" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft goes into detail on their “AI for Good” page.&nbsp; The testimonials highlight the power of AI as applied to:</p>



<ul><li>Environmental sustainability (image recognition of land use, wildlife tracking, maximizing farm yields)</li><li>Healthcare (dredging through data to find diseases)</li><li>Accessibility (machine translation, text to speech)</li><li>Humanitarian action and Cultural Heritage preservation</li></ul>



<p>Even the Chinese search engine Baidu, not exactly known for their humanitarian work, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/baidu-becomes-first-chinese-firm-to-join-us-safe-a-i-consortium/">has joined</a> the OpenAI “safe AI” consortium, which is nominally dedicated to developing and selling only <em>safe </em>AI.</p>



<p>The theme among all these public “good AI” initiatives — the sales pitch to the public — is:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We’re developing advanced AI, but we’re partnering with NGOs, hospitals, and more, to make this AI work <em>for </em>people, not against them.&nbsp; Look at all the good we can do!”</p></blockquote>



<p>This isn’t fake.&nbsp; Microsoft <em>is </em>working with nonprofits, NGOs, and more, to deploy for-the-people AI.&nbsp; But these applications don’t get us closer to the <em>real </em>question:</p>



<p>“What solutions are <em>normal</em> companies <em>actually deploying </em>with AI-as-a-service cloud technology?”</p>



<p>We can peek behind the curtain at Amazon.&nbsp; Amazon’s AWS has been for the last decade synonymous with “the cloud”, and still has a full 50% market share.&nbsp; The bleeding edge of AWS are plug-and-play machine learning and AI tools: Amazon Forecast (machine learning), Amazon Polly (text to speech), Amazon Rekognition (video object recognition), Amazon Comprehend (natural language processing), and more.</p>



<p>And Amazon, alone and refreshingly among tech giants, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3463071/aws-is-ethical-about-ai-but-we-just-don-t-talk-about-it-say-apac-execs.html">doesn’t even pretend</a> to care why their customers use AI:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We certainly don’t want to do evil; everything we’ve released to customers to innovate [helps] to lift the bar on what’s actually happening in the industry. It’s really up to the individual organisation how they use that tech”</p></blockquote>



<p>Amazon sells AI to C-suites, and we know what the hooks are, because the marketing pitches are online.&nbsp; AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/customers/?customer-references-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.publishedDate&amp;customer-references-cards.sort-order=desc&amp;awsf.customer-references-category=category%23ai-ml&amp;awsm.page-customer-references-cards=2">publishes case studies</a> about how their plug-and-play AI and ML solutions are used by customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can look at a typical example <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/dxc/?did=cr_card&amp;trk=cr_card">here</a>, outlining how DXC used AWS’s ML and AI toolkits to improve customer service call center interactions.&nbsp; Fair warning:&nbsp; the full read is catastrophically boring — which is to be expected when AI used not to expand the horizon of what is possible… but instead used to excise human labor from work which is already being done:</p>



<blockquote><p>“DXC has also reduced the lead time to edit and change call flow messaging on its IVR system. With its previous technology, it took two months to make changes to IVR scripts because DXC had to retain a professional voice-over actor and employ a specialized engineer to upload any change. With Amazon Polly, it only takes hours”</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Using Amazon Connect, DXC has been able to automate password resets, so the number of calls that get transferred to an agent has dropped by 30–60 percent.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>DXC anticipates an internal cost reduction of 30–40 percent as a result of implementing Amazon Connect, thanks to increased automation and improved productivity on each call.</p></blockquote>



<p>In total, what did DXC do with its deployed AI solution?&nbsp; AI is being used to:</p>



<ul><li>Replace a voice-over actor</li><li>Eliminate an operations engineer</li><li>Eliminate customer service agents</li></ul>



<p>There’s nothing evil in streamlining operations.&nbsp; But because of the split messaging being used to <em>sell </em>AI research to the public vs to industry — on one hand, visions of environmental sustainability and medical breakthroughs, and on the other hand, the mundane breakthrough of applying a scalpel to a call center’s staffing — the public has little insight (other than nagging discomfort) into automation end-game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complete lack of (organized) public anger or federal AI policy — or even an <em>attempt </em>at a policy — speaks to the success of this doublespeak.</p>



<p><strong>Research motivations</strong></p>



<p>So why are actual engineers and researchers <em>building </em>AI solutions?</p>



<p>I could dredge forums and form theories, but I decided to just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/gz5so7/why_are_you_personally_working_on_ai/">ask on reddit</a>, in a quick and completely unscientific test.&nbsp; Feel free to read all the responses — I’ve tried to aggregate them here and distill them into the four main themes.&nbsp; Weighted by upvotes, here’s the summary:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DvF1XOwrQOuSnpwX0z5y1YLq3keBLTdqSQqyOKj1FrdmNANo2gVWZXWjHnp282aio1EzBBfWMYNPfof4MKZDdeJoQKe18Znbw0jI-iI2QxmmeVkF-MTWGGOsnF1xAaSlMUCtiilV" alt=""></figure>



<p>Preface: none of these are radical new revelations.&nbsp; They match, in degrees, what you’d find with a more exhaustive dragnet of public statements, blogs, or after liquoring up the academic research mainstream.</p>



<p>Walking down the list:</p>



<p><strong>1. Improving the human condition</strong></p>



<p>A plurality goal is to better the human condition, which is promising.&nbsp; An archetypal response is a vision of a future without work (or at least, without universal work):</p>



<blockquote><p>“I believe the fundamental problem of the human race is that pretty much everyone has to work for us to survive.</p><p>So I want to work on fixing that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s not a vision without controversy — it’s an open question whether people can really live fulfilled lives in a world where they <em>aren’t</em> <em>really needed —</em> but at minimum it’s a vision many could get behind, and is at root predicated in a goal of human dignity.</p>



<p><strong>2. It pays</strong></p>



<p>Close behind are crude economics.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p> “Dat money”</p></blockquote>



<p>I don’t intend to sound negative — capitalism is the lever which moves the world, and in capitalism, money follows value.&nbsp; But as shown by AWS, value can come from either revolutionary invention (delivering novel value), or cost excision (delivering <em>cheaper </em>value).</p>



<p>Either direction pays the bills (and engineers), and few megacorp engineers care to peek behind the curtain at which specific aspect of the AI product delivered to clients pays the bills.</p>



<p><strong>3. Transhumanism</strong></p>



<p>Here’s where the interests of true believers in AI diverge from the mainstream.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t really care about modern ML solutions, I am only concerned with AGI. Once we understand the mechanisms behind our own intelligence, we move to the next phase in our species’ evolution. It’s the next paradigm shift. Working on anything else wouldn’t be worth it since the amount of value it brings is so vast.”</p></blockquote>



<p>“I’m in it for the money” is just realism.&nbsp; “A world without work” and “making cheddar” are motivations which appeal to the mainstream, and is at least comprehensible (if frustrating) to those whose jobs are on the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> is different.&nbsp; There’s a prevalent (although possibly not majority) philosophy among many AI researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts, that the goal of developing strong (human-level) AI is not a tool <em>for </em>humans, but an end unto itself.&nbsp; The goal is the creation of a grander intelligence beyond our own:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Or, step-by-step:</p>



<ul><li>Humans create AI 1.0 with IQ human + 1</li><li>AI 1.0 creates AI 2.0, which is slightly smarter</li><li>AI 2.0 creates AI 3.0, which is WAY smarter</li><li>AI 3.0 creates AI 4.0, which is incomprehensibly smarter</li></ul>



<p>And whatever comes next… we can’t predict.</p>



<p>This is not a complete summary of transhumanism.&nbsp; There’s a spectrum of goals, and widespread desire for AI which can integrate <em>with</em> humans — think, nanobots in the brain, neural augmentation, or wholesale digital brain uploads.&nbsp; But either way — whether the goal is to retrofit or replace …</p></div></div>

<p>It was a warm spring evening in London and David Graeber, an anthropology professor at the LSE, was sitting on a rooftop. Our conversation was transmitted through the Internet because of the global travel ban due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, we did not only talk about the new virus and its consequences for society, politics, and the economy. We took the rare opportunity to discuss most of his published works – from the <em>Fragments of Anarchist Anthropology</em> and <em>Debt</em> to <em>Utopia of Rule</em>s, and his most recent book <em>The Bullshit Jobs</em>. All of which have become even more relevant during the corona-crisis.</p>



<p>Professor Graeber presents himself as an anthropologist and anarchist. However, he will not be happy if you refer to him as an “anarchist anthropologist” because there is no such discipline, which he explained during the conversation. The professor is also an activist. He joined many social movements and protests in the last few decades and is often credited as the author of the unofficial slogan from the Occupy Wall Street movement: We are the 99 percent. But he insists that the slogan – as well as everything else in the movement – was a collective effort.</p>



<p>How can democratic governments use this health crisis to enforce authoritarian measures on their citizens? Why don’t the health and care workers strike, during the pandemic, for higher wages? What would happen if we closed Wall Street for a few months? Why do we only see flying cars as special effects in science fiction movies? How can anarchistic principles bring order into chaos during the crisis? Why do we not want to depend on the Chinese and US armies to save our planet?</p>



<p>And finally – how can a drunken rant become a best-selling book?</p>

<p><strong>Everybody seems to be speaking the same language during the coronavirus pandemic – from progressive and conservative governments to ISIS and the anarchists: stay at home, wash your hands, avoid other people … And people have been listening to the officials without much protest. They stayed at home and accepted the new rules. We have not seen anything like this for a long while. What has happened?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there are just not all that many people who are quite crazy enough to ignore medical advice during a pandemic.</p>



<p>It brings to mind the 19<sup>th</sup> century French political thinker Henry Saint-Simon—who might have been the first person to come up with the notion of withering away of the state. He argued that if the state was refounded on scientific basis, eventually it would not need to rely on coercion, and therefore, it wouldn’t even be a state in the contemporary sense of having a monopoly of violence.</p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>



<p>For the same reason, he said, that doctor doesn’t have to threaten to beat you up to convince you to the medicine they prescribe. You know the doctor knows something you don’t know, and you assume the doctor is acting in your best interest. Saint-Simon argued once the state was rationally founded on scientific principles, citizens would act in the same way, and coercive enforcement would become unnecessary. Maybe they’d be a few nutty people who refuse to take their medicine but not enough to make much difference.</p>



<p>Obviously this was all very optimistic and naive—that’s why Marx dismissed people like Saint Simon as “utopian socialists”. But there are certain branches of the government that still claim to operate on such basis. And one could make the argument that they’re not by their nature part of government at all.</p>



<p>During the student movement in the UK in 2010 we talked about this a lot, we were mostly anarchists, but we believed in a public health system, and a public university system. Was this hypocritical? None of us felt it was, but we talked a lot about why. Perhaps the problem is that states don’t allow the existence of public institutions – that is, ones which are both universal and non-profit-oriented – that they don’t control. That doesn’t mean those institutions are somehow of the same nature as the army, or prison system, which are entirely creatures of the state.</p>



<blockquote><p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Yes and of course Foucault would say the authority that does not need a violent force to enforce itself is the scariest kind of all.</strong></p>



<p>He would. Though I think Foucault is often misinterpreted in this regard, to assume that any truth discourse is a form of power, and every form of power is violent and objectionable in itself. True, he sometimes sounds as if that’s what he’s saying. But if specifically challenged, he’d always say, no, no, obviously not.</p>



<p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much. Foucault himself had his own immediate concerns – he was diagnosed as a homosexual in his youth, and wanted to understand how it came about that his most intimate desires could be considered a disease.</p>



<p>He effectively dedicated his life to trying to understand that. But many on the academic left forget that, such diagnoses were not just abstractions, they ultimately relied on force of law, on the threat of physical violence, even if the doctor isn’t personally carrying a gun. A kind of vulgar Foucauldianismn has encouraged us to overlook how much the threat of force really does still lurk behind most of the institutions he describes.</p>



<p>The Panopticon was a prison after all. Normally if you think someone might be staring at you at any moment, you just go someplace else. Actually things have gotten rather worse in that respect since Foucault’s time. There didn’t used to be actual armed guards in schools and hospitals; now in many places there are.</p>



<p><strong>Many governments all over the world are using public health to enforce measures that could not have been imaginable in democratic societies only a few months ago. In Slovenia, for example, individuals are fined when they try to protest against the government actions. Not for protesting, of course. That would be undemocratic. But for violating the law on infectious diseases. So the only groups of people that are allowed move freely are the police, the army, and the politicians.</strong></p>



<p>That does not surprise me. You can learn a lot of things about your state by comparing how they treat a political assembly, and any other kind.</p>



<p><strong>In what way?</strong></p>



<p>In liberal democracies, the entire justification for a country’s legal structure is, typically, some kind of ideal of human freedom and liberty. The American bill of rights begins with the freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly. In practice, the assembly of people that gather in order to protest – which is the very essence of what is supposed to be American – is considered <em>less</em> legitimate than an assembly of people who want to sell you something.</p>



<p>You point this out to most middle-class Americans, they seem incredulous. Poor ones not so much, they don’t assume the rules are fair. Anyway: they’ll say “but of course you have the right to assemble, you just need a permit, what’s wrong with that?” So you have to say “all right, if you have to ask police permission to print something, that’s called not having freedom of the press. If you have to ask police permission to say something..” And they’ll say, “but that’s different! There are traffic issues. You can’t just gather. It gets in the way of people walking down the street” Which is funny, because I don’t remember anywhere in the constitution it says anything about the right to unimpeded traffic flow.</p>



<p>We learned that lesson during the Occupy movement. It was startling, after they evicted our camp, how many middle class Americans just shrugged their shoulders when they went on to rip up the Bill of Rights, the very thing they teach their children to be so proud of…</p>



<blockquote><p>The Anonymous movement has shown that you can have meaningful and impactful protests online. And people all across the world are inventing new ways to protest from their home.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>You were trying to occupy a public space?</strong></p>



<p>Any space. After they evicted us from Zuccotti Park, we tried to reestablish a new camp because… well, it was crucial that everyone knew where we were. That was what was so effective about the original occupation: anyone in the city who felt they wanted to get involved knew where they could go and plug in instantly.</p>



<p>At first we thought we could relocate to a huge lot near Wall Street that belong to the Episcopalian Church, they agreed, but huge pressure was place on the Church hierarchy and eventually they reversed themselves. We had a march led by several bishops trying to occupy anyway; the cops beat us up, and the media refused to show any footage of the priests but only anyone in masks to make us look violent and scary.</p>



<p>Then we occupied a park that was open all night and they changed the rules of the park. We then got a legal ruling from a judge that we could sleep on the sidewalk as long as we do not take more than half of it. So the city just passed an order that Lower Manhattan was an emergency zone where legal decisions do not apply. So we decided to occupy the stairs of the building where the Bill of Rights was actually signed, which is right near Wall Street incidentally, but wasn’t under city jurisdiction. We were immediately were surrounded by SWAT teams and after two days they found a way to force us from there.</p>



<p>We tried everything to set up a legal alternative. But the state completely simply shredded the very legal principles that they teach children are what makes them proud to be Americans, and the media didn’t even cover it.</p>



<p><strong>But what can you occupy when you are not allowed to even leave your own apartment?</strong></p>



<p>There are always things you can do. The Anonymous movement has shown that you …</p></div></div>

When I say “trying”, I really meant I spent some time configuring and using those editors. The ones I spent time using are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, my main, daily editor I use for pretty much almost all projects I work on.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, that I currently use at work to hack on Java codebases.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, that I have been trying mainly in Rust, TOML and Markdown.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">emacs</a>, that I highly hacked around to play on my Haskell and Rust codebases (and YAML / Markdown / TOML too).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">DOOM Emacs</a>, that I tried when I saw a colleague in a previous company I worked in (I was impressed by the “united” feeling of the UI and by how everything looked so slick). So I gave it a try.</li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>’s take on editors. Same thing, mostly Rust, Haskell, etc.</li>
<li>A bunch of others that I won’t talk about because I quickly stopped using.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this article is to create a temporal “snapshot” of my views on editors and what I think about the current situation. I have been using vim and especially neovim for more than a decade. I need to explain about my current workflow and what I cherish in editing before talking about each editors. Expect a point of view from a neovimer which is looking around at lots of editors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is only a personal workflow / point of view that works well <em>for me right now</em>. It doesn’t mean it will for you and it doesn’t mean a different workflow would be worse.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard layout</h2>
<p>I am French and I’m using a keyboard layout that is made to type very quickly in French and to code. With hindsight, since I type more often in English than in French, maybe I should have picked another keyboard layout, but the coding experience in my keyboard layout is really great, so I stick around.</p>
<p>The keyboard layout is <strong>bépo</strong>. I learned bépo the “recommended” way — i.e.&nbsp;you have to practice <em>typing</em> (« dactylographie » in French). It means that I use all my fingers to type on a keyboard, and that each key on the keyboard is assigned <em>a single finger</em> that will press it. That helps a lot with muscle memory and to reduce wrist pain (my wrists barely move when I type on a keyboard), among other things. The typing speed is a side-effect of being accurate and having good comfort (if you are curious, I’m pretty fast but there are faster people — I type at around 120 to 130 words per minute). Because I think the speed doesn’t matter when programming, I think the most important part to remember here is the comfort: the wrists don’t move and my fingers fly around the keyboard, whatever the speed.</p>
<h2 id="modal-editors">Modal editors</h2>
<p>I think a modal editor is superior, for various reasons. The first one is that I truly <strong>hate</strong> having to use a <em>mouse</em> for something that can be done without having to move around hundred of pixels with your cursor and clicking on buttons. For instance, running an application, on my current machines, is simply typing <code>alt d</code>, the name of the program (I typically use completion, so I never type fully the name of the program) and hit enter. All this without moving my hands from the keyboard. And I do that for programs like <code>firefox</code>, <code>kdenlive</code>, etc. but for terminal applications, I simply type and complete them in my terminal, which I open simply with <code>alt return</code>.</p>
<p>So, using a mouse to move around a cursor in an editor feels like completely suboptimal to me, especially because we write code (i.e.&nbsp;we type on a keyboard) most of the time, so moving around with the mouse implies several back and forth movements between the keyboard and the mouse. Maybe you don’t care and it’s cool to you, but to me, this is truly <em>horror land</em>. I feel <em>very</em> uncomfortable when doing this.</p>
<p>Also, <em>modern editors</em> that are not modal typically make people move by using the arrows keys, which are either far on your keyboard, or — like my keyboard, a 60% home made one — not in direct access and then require a function key to enable them.</p>
<p>So that’s the first reason why I like modal editors. They make a smarter use of your keyboard for simple yet recurrent features, like moving around — e.g.&nbsp;<code>h j k l</code>. The second reason why I like them is because of the facts they have a completely new mode for non-modal editor (i.e.&nbsp;the <em>normal</em> mode), you have a whole keyboard / lots of keys to bind actions to and do lots of things people usually do with the mouse. Being able to split an editor into several buffers, move around the buffers, go at the beginning of the paragraph, search and replace, register actions into macros and replay them, etc. All this without even moving the wrists. The learning curve is steep if you’re used to the mouse, but once you’ve passed the mental barrier, really, and this is a personal opinion, but I truly think that using the mouse again after that feels like handicap to me.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-like-to-move-around">How I like to move around</h2>
<p>When I look at people coding, I see several kind of programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ones who move with the arrows or with <code>h j k l</code> in modal editors. You can spot them very easily at how the cursor moves in a document. It typically implies keeping a key pressed until the cursor reach a given row, then pressing another key until the cursor reach a given column and then adjust if they went passed the location they had in mind.</li>
<li>People using the mouse, by clicking at the place they want to put the cursor at.</li>
<li>People using <em>relative numbers</em>. That’s an enhancement of the first group: they typically use relative numbers to know which lines they want to jump to very quickly, so that they don’t have to press the up / down keys for ages until reaching the line they want to. Instead, they look at the number on the lines, press that number, and the direction, and bam, they are on the lines. They then use typical motions from vim like <code>$</code> (go to end of line), <code>f</code> (go to the first occurrence of the next character typed after <code>f</code>, like <code>f(</code> will make your cursor go to the next <code>(</code>), <code>%</code> (go to the matching delimiter) or <code>w</code> (go to the beginning of the next word) / <code>b</code> (go to the beginning of the previous word), etc. to move faster on the same line (it works across lines too).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents 99,9% of what I see people do. Obviously, you will get that I don’t belong to the second set of people… but I don’t really belong to any, actually. How I move is, I guess, convoluted for most people and I know some people won’t understand how it can feel. I use <code>h j k l</code> and all the motions from vim described in the third group (and even more; I full lecture of four hours would be required to explain all of them :D), but it all depends on the <em>distance</em> I need to travel. If my cursor is on a word and I want to move to the beginning of a word located very closely to my cursor on the same line, I’ll simply type <code>www</code> if it’s three words apart (or <code>3w</code> if I’m feeling funny). If the distance is higher, I use a tool called [EasyMotion].</p>
<p>Easymotion really is a wonderful tool. The idea is that it has several modes, depending on the kind of move you want to perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>By lines</em>: this mode allows you to jump to any line in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By words</em>: tihs mode allows you to jump to any “word” in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By characters</em>: when the <em>word</em> mode doesn’t help with jumping to a special operator or character (because it’s not recognized as a word), this mode allows you to jump to any character in the current or (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li>It has other modes but I have never really found useful cases for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I typically do it is by mapping the three modes to <code>&lt;leader&gt;l</code>, <code>&lt;leader&gt;w&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;leader&gt;c</code> (in my case, <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> is the <em>space</em> key).</p>
<p>Typing <code>SPC l</code> in my current buffer results in this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_lines.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion lines</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typing any highlighted character will make my cursor jump to it. The same applies for words, with <code>SPC w</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_words.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion words</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the <em>character</em> mode, after pressing <code>SPC c</code>, I have to press another character (the one I want to jump to). Let’s say we want to jump to a <code>#</code> (which is not part of words): <code>SPC c #</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_chars.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion characters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This way of moving is not intuitive at first, but once you get used to it… it’s a <em>must have</em>.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-other-modal-candies">All the other modal candies</h2>
<p>Among all the things that I like about modal editing, here is a non-exhaustive list of features I expect to have around my fingers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-i</code> and <code>C-o</code>: those allows me to jump to something / a file / a place in a buffer and then go back to where I was right before with <code>C-o</code> (read it like <em>out</em>) or go back again with <code>C-i</code> (read it like <em>in</em>).</li>
<li>Macros and registers: those allow me to yank content into different registers (like clipboards) by assigning a single key to paste their content. For instance, I can put a few lines in my <code>t</code> register with <code>"tyi(</code> (“put in the <code>t</code> register the <code>y</code>ank <code>i</code>nside matching <code>(</code>), and paste that content later with <code>"tp</code>. Macros allow more powerful editing control by assigning a key to set of actions with the <code>q</code> keyword (<code>qa</code> will register all the next keystrokes and actions into the <code>a</code> macro). Then simply replay the macro with <code>@a</code>, for instance.</li>
<li>Obviously, all the basic vim motions, like <code>d</code> to delete, <code>y</code> to yank, <code>c</code> to change, <code>t</code> to go to the character right before the one you search, <code>%</code> to go to the other delimiter, etc. And more complex text manipulation, such as “Let’s change what’s inside this function parameter list, delimited by <code>(</code>”: <code>ci(</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take too much time to list everything, but the main idea is: I need the modal features when editing code.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about the list of editors I mentioned in the preface. The idea is to give <em>my own opinion</em> on those …</p></div></section></div>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published September 06, 2020</p><p>PostgreSQL 13 development is coming along nicely, Postgres 13 Beta3 was
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2060/">released on 8/13/2020</a>.
The Postgres Beta 1 and 2 releases were released in May and June 2020.
One of the features that has my interest in Postgres 13 is the B-Tree deduplication effort.  B-Tree indexes are the default indexing method
in Postgres, and are likely the most-used indexes in production 
environments.
Any improvements to this part of the database are likely to have wide-reaching benefits.
Removing duplication from indexes keeps their physical size smaller,
reduces I/O overhead, and should help keep <code>SELECT</code> queries fast!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There is a good summary of the what and how of this improvement
in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/b-tree-index-deduplication/">Laurenz Albe's post</a> from early in June 2020, presumably using
Pg13 Beta1.  <a href="https://www.highgo.ca/2020/07/06/features-in-pg13-deduplication-in-b-tree-indexes/">Hamid Akhtar's post in July</a>
covered this feature using Pg13 Beta2 and a different approach including
a look at the performance using <code>EXPLAIN</code>.
This post takes yet another look at this improvement using Pg13 Beta3.
I intend to see how well this improvement pans out on a data set I use in production.  For that task my go-to is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.</p>
<h2>Install Postgres 13 Beta 3</h2>
<p>The first step is to install the two versions of Postgres (12 and 13beta3) 
on a single Ubuntu 18 host.  In the past when I have tested pre-production
releases I have built Postgres from source instead of using <code>apt</code>.
This time around I decided to use <code>apt install</code>, so am including the
basic process for that.</p>
<p>The advised way to install PostgreSQL is from the pgdg (PostgreSQL Global Development Group) repositories,
see <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">the Postgres wiki</a> for more.
To enable the beta versions, the line needed in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/bionic-pgdg main 13
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, update the sources and install Postgres and PostGIS.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
# Postgres 12
sudo apt install postgresql-12 postgresql-12-postgis-3
# Postgres 13 (Currently Beta)
sudo apt install postgresql-13 postgresql-13-postgis-3
</code></pre>
<p>On Ubuntu, installing multiple versions will create multiple instances running on different ports. The test server I'm using to write this post
currently has three versions of Postgres installed, only two are currently running. Postgres 12 was installed first so "won" the default port of 5432.  Postgres 11 was installed second and was assigned 5433, and Pg13 beta 3 was installed last and was assigned port 5434.  The <code>pg_lsclusters</code> is avaiable on Debian/Ubuntu hosts as part of the wrapper around <code>pg_ctl</code>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u postgres pg_lsclusters
Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file
11  main    5433 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/11/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-11-main.log
12  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log
13  main    5434 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/13/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log
</code></pre>

<p>This post does not use Postgres 11 beyond this example.</p>

<p>When working with multiple versions installed it is helpful to verify
versions match what you expect them to be.
First, the port 5432 for Postgres 12 version.</p>
<pre><code>psql -d pgosm -p 5432 -c "select version();"

<h2>Create Indexes</h2>
<p>Both versions of Postgres were loaded with the same Colorado OpenStreetMap
data loaded <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.
The osm2pgsql does not create any B-Tree indexes on its own, only the GIST
indexes on geometries.
For this post, we examine B-Tree index sizes created on four columns:
<code>osm_id</code>, <code>highway</code>, <code>waterway</code>, and <code>natural</code>.
Looking at the stats on the <code>public.planet_osm_line</code> table I can make 
a couple guesses where we will and will not see gains based on <code>n_distinct</code>.
I can guess we will not see major gains in the
<code>osm_id</code>, there is only a small amount of duplication in those values.
The other three columns (<code>highway</code>, <code>natural</code> and <code>waterway</code>) have a small number of distinct values
and varying amounts of <code>NULL</code> values.  These three columns would all
be candidates for partial indexes to avoid indexing the <code>NULL</code> values,
thus reducing the size of the created index.
I have hopes to see the benefits in Postgres 13 on these columns, possibly
making the use of partial indexes less frequent.</p>
<pre><code> SELECT attname, n_distinct, null_frac
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stats
    WHERE tablename = 'planet_osm_line'
        AND attname IN ('osm_id', 'highway', 'waterway', 'natural')
;

</code></pre>
<h3>Index on <code>osm_id</code></h3>
<p>First up is the <code>osm_id</code> column, a nearly unique set of positive and 
negative values.  The index to create in both versions:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_osm_id ON public.planet_osm_line (osm_id);
</code></pre>
<p>The following query is used throughout to report out index sizes.
The query itself will not be repeated, as only the filter would change.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT ai.schemaname AS s_name, ai.relname AS t_name,
        ai.indexrelname AS index_name,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text)) AS index_size,
        pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text) AS index_size_bytes
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_all_indexes ai
    WHERE ai.indexrelname LIKE 'ix_osm_line%'
    ORDER BY index_name
;
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the low number of duplicates, it is no surprise that the
show only a tiny reduction in the size.  The reduction
would not be detectable from only the <code>index_size</code> column (in MB), the
<code>index_size_bytes</code> shows the slight reduction in size (29,515,776 bytes vs. 29,384,704 bytes).</p>

<h3>Index on <code>highway</code></h3>
<p>The <code>highway</code> data in the <code>planet_osm_line</code> data is a good example of when
a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html">partial index</a>
might typically be a good idea to minimize index size.  My hunch (and hope)
is that the de-duplication will make a partial index here a moot point by reducing the size required to index a large number of <code>NULL</code> values.</p>
<p>Create two indexes, one partial covering the non-<code>NULL</code> values and one full
index on the entire table.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_partial 
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway)
    WHERE highway IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_full
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway);

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Try to remember the first time you heard about this fascinating language called <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. Chances are, you had by the time been developing software using Ruby. If that's the case, Elixir seems to have appeared out of nowhere until suddenly, it became the solution for all your previous problems. It is fast, clean, scales extremely well. It was <strong>almost</strong> like the Ruby you've always wanted to have, but never got.</p><p>I say <strong>almost</strong>, because as much as you want it to be, <strong>Elixir is not Ruby</strong>. The familiar syntax has definitely helped the language win the hearts of the broader developer community. Yet, under the hood, <strong>Elixir is all about Erlang.</strong> The <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Erlang</a> that everyone tells stories about, as if it were some mythical creature, but no one dares to touch.</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/09/book-cover.png" alt="" width="500" height="700"><figcaption>Elixir for Non-Ruby Programmers</figcaption></figure><p>Why am I saying all of this? First, because I would love to see greater adoption of Elixir outside Ruby/Rails community. It was among that group of people where the idea first sparked, and I fully respect the fact. Nevertheless, I would love to see it growing out. As someone who discovered Elixir after years of doing Java, &nbsp;.NET and more recently, Go, I can say that there is enough goodness in it for everyone. Moreover, bringing people with different backgrounds (both technical and non-technical) will lead to an explosion of new ideas. Having more diverse minds will help us better understand and make use of the elephant in the room-Erlang.</p><p>This brings me to my second point. Erlang is not obscure at all, once you give it enough attention. It is actually oddly satisfying, once you start reading code written in it. I have had my few a-ha moments, when I figured the original inspiration for most constructs in Elixir. The point is, we shouldn't fear Erlang, but try to understand it. This applies both to when things go well, as well as when they go south.</p><p>My biggest hope of all is that by understanding Erlang well enough, the Elixir community will start looking for new uses for it. Uses that go beyond being a scalable replacement for Rails apps. More daring and more ambitious uses, where Erlang's resilience model can prove to be critical for the success of the mission. I'd love to see it used in transportation, space, as well as the domain that started it all- telecommunications.</p><blockquote>“Shoot for the moon.

<p>What happens when you call LinearRegression().fit(X,y)?</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://blog.stevenchun.me/2020/04/linear-regression-I/" data-popup-title="Under the Hood: Linear Regression" data-popup-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg" data-popup-abstract="It's not your Grandfather's Econometrics!">last post,
</a> we derived the least squares normal equations.</p>

<p>So, from a theoretical standpoint you’d be 100% correct if you said,
“Scikit-learn solves the least squares normal equations”. Good job. And to go
further, you could talk about using different matrix factorizations to
efficiently solve the normal equations, like SVD or QR or LU. But there’s a
story we miss by ignoring the actual code and hardware that will solve least
squares.</p>
<p>Like pretty much all modern software, Scikit-learn and its contemporaries stand
on the shoulders of giants: NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, and work done in the 70s to revolutionize scientific computing.</p>
<p>Understanding this work and its modern forms is critical to an end-to-end
understanding of why your 2015 Macbook is burning the tops of your thighs as you
run an ill advised regression for a term paper. This is not a particularly
technical post, as I don’t think I could do justice to the hardware
optimizations involved. Instead, we’ll dig into modern linear regression as a
way to develop a mental picture of the structures involved.</p>

Scipy doing?</p>

</a> reveals that
it…doesn’t do anything? It checks for any mismatch in the shapes of the
input, but there’s no matrix factoring, not even a dot product.</p>
<h2 id="LAPACK-and-BLAS"><a href="#LAPACK-and-BLAS" title="LAPACK and BLAS"></a>LAPACK and BLAS</h2><p>Rather than performing the calculations itself, SciPy actually calls a LAPACK
subroutine to do all the matrix factoring work. Which subroutine depends on
which option you pass to it: “gelsd” for divide-and-conquer SVD, “gelsy” for
complete orthogonal factorization, or “gels” for QR/LQ factorization. LAPACK in
turn calls a BLAS subroutine to do all the scalar, vector, and matrix work.
These programs are very particular. Different architectures will have different
implementations.
Some of the really-fast implementations were hand-written by a guy on sabbatical
from the Japanese Patent Office.</p>
<h3 id="LAPACK"><a href="#LAPACK" title="LAPACK"></a>LAPACK</h3><p>LAPACK was a project out of Tennessee and Rice Universities, the Numerical
Algorithms Group, a private non-profit, and Oak Ridge and Argonne National
Laboratories in the early 90s. This assemblage of researchers all saw the need
for a standardized, fast package that provided “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bischof/publication/220781801_LAPACK_A_Portable_Linear_Algebra_Library_for_High-Performance_Computers/links/00b7d519e119d012bc000000/LAPACK-A-Portable-Linear-Algebra-Library-for-High-Performance-Computers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bischof/publication/220781801_LAPACK_A_Portable_Linear_Algebra_Library_for_High-Performance_Computers/links/00b7d519e119d012bc000000/LAPACK-A-Portable-Linear-Algebra-Library-for-High-Performance-Computers.pdf" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="">routines for solving systems of
simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of overdetermined
systems of equations, and eigenvalue problems.
</a>”</p>
<p>These sorts of things had been tried before in LINPACK and EISPACK, but those
packages weren’t written with modern computer architectures in mind. The
original Intel Pentium chip had come out in 1993 and brought a split L1 cache<label for="ad0dd30cc0a2320fb30580b38d61955c0ad19c9df743e3b0bf43dfeb0b6e53c4"></label><span> If you have a rough idea of what an L1 cache is, here’s an insanely thorough

was also releasing some very nice x86 chips. But then, Quake was released by id
Software, which targeted the Pentium processor’s ability to interleave floating
point and integer operations, something Cyrix’s chips couldn’t do. “Quake was
extremely popular, and everyone used it in their performance tests – and thus
hammered the Cyrix chips, even though the Cyrix was faster in ordinary use, in
business/work/Windows operation, indeed in every other game except Quake. And
ultimately that killed Cyrix off.”  From <a href="https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/49259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="The rise &amp; fall of the first real x86 rival to Intel: the Cyrix 6x86" data-popup-image="https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png" data-popup-abstract="I was surprised to read someone castigating and condemning the Cyrix line of PC CPUs today.

Well, now I do. Such is the epistemic problem of writing a blog post in order to
learn about what you’re writing about.
</span>. The basic problem here is that CPUs got quite fast at
multiplying numbers, but accessing those numbers from memory hadn’t kept up. So,
programs that didn’t pay attention to the cost of moving data started being
bottlenecked by the speed of memory access rather than the speed of their
processors.</p>
<p>LAPACK was written in FORTRAN 77 for modern memory hierarchies with multiple
parallel, processors; and that made it stupid fast. Of course, you can’t write a
library that’ll be optimal for all architectures. You have different cache
sizes; you might have an L3 or L4 cache. But LAPACK didn’t need to, because it
wasn’t actually doing the low-level calculations. For that, it relied on
whatever Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines—BLAS<label for="e6cd2e246ce0576c0ea8487b43e72e470d101ecc87c677ed98fd670616ef5b6e"></label><span> Obviously. Honestly, I’m way more in on the all-cap, pronounceable acronym,

<h3 id="BLAS"><a href="#BLAS" title="BLAS"></a>BLAS</h3><p>In the late 70s, the nerds at JPL came out with a FORTRAN library of
thirty-eight basic linear algebra subroutines. Stuff like a dot-product,
implemented in a way that was fast and correct. This way an aeronautical
engineer didn’t have to worry that his code for, like, a 2-norm<label for="221c330c1fb37958b3a7aeba1299318f19846fae4c652d177db65ff3cd1cd4aa"></label><span> A 2-norm is just the Euclidean distance of the vector. I have no idea how it
should interact with complex numbers. This way, I don’t have to!
</span> handled a
complex vector correctly. And that might mean fewer rocket crashes.</p>
<p>While it started out as an actual library, BLAS persisted more as a
specification. Anyone could write a BLAS implementation that was fast on their
hardware, and any program designed to use BLAS could use any of these
implementations.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on a Mac, you’re running <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/blas" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Apple Developer Documentation" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="">Apple’s implementation
</a> of BLAS
and LAPACK, specially optimized, like much of Apple software, for its own
hardware.</p>
<p>There’s a useful idea here that some constructs are so widely used that it’s
worth a lot of effort to eek out small performance gains which then aggregate to
huge performance gains.</p>
<p>One example from a 2017 talk on Google’s<label for="04aa2b4d1a716f77545c559a01ac048a92f2ad4dd1c31988ec4cf32af492f5a3"></label><span>Disclaimer: I work at Google. I was not involved in this work.
</span> efforts to develop faster, more
efficient hash tables:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hash tables are incredibly performance sensitive. At Google, right now, as I am
speaking, in our fleet, one percent of the CPU’s are computing something in a
hash table. As I am speaking, more than four percent of Google’s RAM is owned by
a hash table. And that’s just C++”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same idea applies to a dot product. If your supercomputer weather simulation
does a lot of dot products, you might save days of compute time by having a good
BLAS implementation for your hardware.</p>
<p>This is where Mr. Kazushige Goto comes in.</p>
<h2 id="The-Man-from-the-Patent-Office"><a href="#The-Man-from-the-Patent-Office" title="The Man from the Patent Office"></a>The Man from the Patent Office</h2><p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2005/11/28/business/28super.1841.jpg" alt="Kazushige Goto standing next to a research
poster"></p>
<p>Prior to 2002, Kazushige Goto worked in the Japanese Patent Office. While he was
there, he developed a knack for tinkering with the subroutines on computers to
improve bottlenecks. I say this, of course, in the same sense that Babe Ruth
developed a knack for hitting home runs. From a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/technology/writing-the-fastest-code-by-hand-for-fun-a-human-computer-keeps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Writing the Fastest Code, by Hand, for Fun: A Human Computer Keeps Speeding Up Chips" data-popup-image="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" data-popup-abstract="Kazushige Goto, research associate at Texas Advanced Computing Center at University of Texas in Austin, has become legend in world of supercomputing by single-handedly producing at his keyboard programs that run world's fastest computers and doing it faster than powerful automated systems and entire teams of software developers; value of his work goes far beyond setting speed records because Goto's programs can more efficiently solve complex linear equations, thus offering better solutions in virtually every computational science and engineering problem; photo (M)">2005 New York Times profile
</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To help in his work, Mr. Goto purchased a Digital Equipment workstation based
on the Alpha microprocessor in 1994 to perform a simulation.  But when it
arrived he could not understand why it was performing so slowly. So he explored
the Alpha’s design to see where the performance bottlenecks were.</p>
<p>He later purchased a second Alpha-based computer and by rewriting the crucial
subroutines was able to improve its performance to 78 percent of its theoretical
peak calculating speed, up from 44 percent.</p>
<p>Although he was not formally trained in computer or software design, he
perfected his craft by learning from programmers on an Internet mailing list
focusing on the Linux operating system for the Alpha chip. His curiosity quickly
became a passion that he pursued in his free time and during his twice daily
two-hour train commute between his job in Tokyo and his home in Kanagawa
Prefecture.</p>
<p>‘I would frequently work on these problems until midnight,’ he said. ‘I did it
to relax.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, this sort of hardware whispering doesn’t go unnoticed,
and eventually Mr. Goto got the call up to the Texas Advanced Computer Center at
UT Austin to apply his gifts to supercomputing while on sabbatical from the
patent office. At the time of this profile, 4 out of the 11 fastest
supercomputers were running GotoBLAS, Goto’s optimized implementation for
Intel’s Nehalem processor.</p>
<p>The narrative of Goto-the-Auteur’s is painted in sharp relief to contemporary
efforts to automate the process of optimizing BLAS for different processors. The
Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software or ATLAS is a BLAS implementation
that can perform a sort of hyperparameter sweep on any processor to identify a
reasonably good BLAS implementation. This sort of approach means that ATLAS is
often the first good BLAS implementation available on a new processor, but is
eventually eclipsed by hand-tuned implementations.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I find this immensely aesthetic. The idea that deep learning,
whose signature trait seems to be the ability to replicate those domains of
man—art, perception, language—with all its …</p></article></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he only person David Kiragu lied to about the texts was his mom. To those close to him, like his partner, friends, former schoolmates, and work colleagues, he explained what was going on. To more distant contacts, including annoying relatives, he said nothing.</p>



<p>His mother probably knew he was lying — mothers often do — but she let it slide.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t tell her the truth,” Kiragu said to me last December. “So I told her it was one of those prison scams and she should ignore it.”</p>



<p>He owed money. Not a lot of it, but that didn’t matter. His fintech creditor was still telling everyone in Kiragu’s inner circle that he was a deadbeat.</p>



<p>It happened like this: Toward the end of March 2018, Kiragu found himself in a bind. At 32, he earned a solid income as a manager at an iNGO in Nairobi. But for the first time in his life, he couldn’t make rent.</p>



<p>His choices were limited. He could always borrow the remainder from friends, family, or somebody else in his network. The problem was that if he did, people would know he was living beyond his means.</p>



<p>But then one morning Kiragu logged into his Facebook account and saw an ad for a fintech app called OKash that promised to be the discreet friend who would spot him some cash and never mention it again. Offering the ability to “process loans in seconds,” OKash is one of many fintech apps that have sprung up in Kenya since 2012. All he needed to do was download the app, enter his financial details, and let the algorithm generate a credit rating. He would get the money he needed and could pay it back once he was liquid.</p>



<p>He doesn’t remember that day too well now, but Kiragu thinks it took just minutes to apply for his loan. His money arrived right away, so he paid his bills and moved on. “I started with about $15, which I repaid [on time], and my loan limit expanded. Then I borrowed about $35, which I also repaid,” he told me as we sat on the balcony of a chic restaurant in a mall outside Nairobi.</p>



<p>It was the third loan that upended his life. He needed it to top up his rent, because by then a vicious cycle had begun, wherein he would pay off his loan then borrow again to fill the hole that the last payment had left in his finances.</p>



<p>Kiragu started getting calls even before that deadline passed.</p>



<p>“Will you repay your OKash loan?” Kiragu remembers a caller asking him, before warning that if he missed a payment, the company would notify everyone on his contact list. In texts he showed me on his phone, an OKash representative had written an hour before the deadline lapsed, “Despite several polite reminders on your OKash loan . . . No PAYMENT received yet . . . Note that we are going to invade your privacy according to Terms of Service clause 8, IF NOT CLEARED BY 4PM.” The clause in question reads as follows: “In the event we cannot get in contact with you or your emergency contact, you also expressly authorise us to contact any and all persons in your contact list.”</p>



<p>In the days after the deadline, debt collectors hounded Kiragu, calling three to four times every hour. They also cast a wide net. “They texted just about everyone I know,” Kiragu says. His parents and many friends got messages. One of his colleagues even shared a screenshot of a text from OKash in an office-wide WhatsApp Group.</p>



<p>“Some [people] sympathized with me,” Kiragu wrote in a Facebook post about the experience. “Some were laughing at me and some were actually very annoyed that OKash is exposing and shaming me . . . Even my boss called me to ask if everything is okay.”</p>



<p>But his colleagues weren’t his main concern. What worried him more was what his parents would think. After an estranged aunt shared the message within his village, Kiragu’s father accused him of bringing shame on the family.</p>



<p>This was nearly two years ago, but the memory is still raw, so much so that Kiragu asked to use a pseudonym for this article. “If you pay on time, they are angels,” Kiragu said as he sipped his tea and stared at a potted plant behind me. “They keep texting you to take out another loan with them. If you do and won’t or can’t pay, then it’s pretty simple: Pay or we damage what you value most.”</p>

Naomi Wanjiku, a M-Pesa agent, arranges a customer's transaction at a M-Pesa kiosk in South B, a residential area of the city. M-Pesa, (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money), is a Kenyan cellphone-based money transfer service. The majority of its customers have no bank accounts, but they withdraw cash and make payments or send money using their cell phones. A network of appointed agents, scattered all over the country, provide the cashing handling services.

<hr>



<p><strong>In 2007, Safaricom</strong>, Kenya’s biggest telecoms provider, launched M-Pesa, a mobile wallet that allowed users to send and receive money and buy airtime. Smartphones were just becoming popular, so Safaricom tailored its fintech product to the basic cell phones most Kenyans already owned. It was immediately hailed as a revolutionary way to bring millions of “unbanked” customers into the formal financial sector. The Clinton Global Initiative and other major philanthropic organizations were vocal supporters, and it was soon being taught as a case study in business schools around the world. It was also a success on the ground: Safaricom aimed to sign up 350,000 M-Pesa users by the end of 2007, but by November it had already attracted over 1 million. From there, it only continued to grow. As of last September, 23.6 million Kenyans — nearly half of the country’s population — were using it regularly.</p>



<p>M-Pesa was initially meant to be a microfinance project; its first sales pitch to users was “Send Money Home.” It was banking on the fact that while working-class Kenyans who lived away from home wanted to support their families, cash is expensive. This was not a new concept; among Somalis, the Hawala system exists to address this same problem. If you want to send money to someone, you give it to a local agent, who then contacts a second agent located in the same area as the intended recipient, and that agent then disburses the money. Both agents earn a small commission, and they sort each other out.</p>



<p>In Kenya, there were several factors behind M-Pesa’s rapid ascent. One was that 2007 was an election year, and when violence erupted over the results, having a way to transfer money without leaving the house felt to Kenyans like a godsend. Another, more structural, reason was that before M-Pesa, the country’s banking sector served only a portion of the population. Kenya’s economy collapsed four times between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, by which point the banks were heavily regulated. It was nearly impossible for low-income Kenyans, including millennials, to get loans. No such legal barriers applied to fintech.</p>



<p>When fintech took off, banks, Silicon Valley–backed products, private-equity products, and Kenyan companies all began competing for the same clients. One of the first savings-and-lending apps, called M-Shwari, was launched in 2012 through a partnership between a local bank and Safaricom. Some of its earliest users were Kenyans in the informal economy. In a 2017 social media post, for example, a business journalist noted that “up to a third of loans are taken between the hours of 3am and 5am. Most are repaid within twenty-four hours.” When the Central Bank looked into what was going on, they discovered that a typical user was a market seller who would wake up early and borrow enough money to pay everybody in her supply chain that day. She would then work until evening, pay back the loan, and repeat the cycle again the next morning.</p>



<p>Within a few years, credit-app use had started to spread throughout Kenyan society. Over a 13-year period, financial inclusion<a href="https://fsdkenya.org/publication/finaccess2019/"> jumped</a> from nearly 27 percent, in 2006, to almost 83 percent. And the product side grew as well. As of September 2018, according to a report from Financial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD), the two main app stores offered 110 credit apps.</p>



<p>Almost all of these companies make their money by providing short-term loans with high interest rates. But that’s often where transparency around the business model ends. Since there is no regulatory framework governing fintech, it is hard to know who exactly owns an app or even where the money is coming from. The absence of regulation has many perks for the sector and one major liability: As companies soon discovered, if a user does not pay back what they have borrowed, plus interest, there is little a digital lender can do. Users can simply delete the app and move on. One solution to this problem has been to flag defaulters to one of Kenya’s three credit reference bureaus (CRBs), effectively locking them out of the credit market. It’s unclear how effective this strategy is, but it’s frequently used. Between 2014 and 2017, about 2.7 million Kenyans were negatively listed with a CRB, 15 percent of them for defaulting on loans of less than about $2. Last year, “how to check CRB status” was among the most-Googled questions in Kenya, between “how to be successful in life” and “how to get pregnant.”</p>



<p>Before long, digital lenders started looking into other methods of recouping their investments. Skip tracing, the ancient art of finding someone who owes you money and making them pay, was virtually nonexistent among fintech companies until early 2018. Coincidentally, that was the same year that Opay, a fintech company partially owned by the software-maker Opera, launched OKash in Kenya. The majority of Opera’s operations had been bought by a consortium of Chinese investors two years earlier, and shortly afterward, the company went on an expansion spree, announcing plans to invest $100 million in East Africa. While Opera’s then managing director, a former banker&nbsp; named Edward Ndichu, said at the time that the app would protect users’ personal information, he never explained how the company planned to safeguard its financial investment. But the answer was buried in OKash’s terms and conditions: When users download the app, they give it permission to access their contacts.</p>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><strong><em><span>We are super-excited that a significant milestone, the feature freeze of the next major version of Qt, has been reached! We now have the functionality in place, and the following months will be spent in polishing and tuning the release. Target is to complete the maturation phase in the coming months to be able to release Qt 6.0.0 in December.</span></em></strong></p>
<!--more--><p><span>Over the past few years, we have been working to research, plan, and create the next Qt version. Qt 5 has been a great success, and it is a solid foundation for the development of applications and devices still for many years to come. But the world is changing, so we are introducing a version that takes Qt users into the new decade. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Qt 6 technical vision blog post by Lars</a> offers a great overview of Qt 6.0 future strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Qt 6.0 Timeline</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are already multiple separate blog posts regarding the features and functionality of Qt 6, and there are also many more to come. Therefore, in this post, I am focusing on the structure, and timeline of Qt 6.0. </span></p>
<p><span>First, let’s review the major milestones of the Qt 6.0 development schedule:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>January 2020: Qt 5.15 branched, development branch becomes Qt 6.0, merge of the feature branches</span></li>
<li><span>June 2020: Structural freeze, supported modules and platforms defined, first binary snapshot released</span></li>
<li><span>August 2020: Feature freeze, all functionality completed </span></li>
<li><span>September 2020: Alpha release</span></li>
<li><span>October 2020: Beta phase starts, multiple beta snapshot releases</span></li>
<li><span>November 2020: Release Candidate</span></li>
<li><span>December 2020: Qt 6.0.0 Release</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With the feature freeze milestone now reached, next milestone is the Alpha release. This is still quite a lot geared for those participating development of Qt itself as well those who want to closely follow how Qt 6.0 is shaping up. The Beta releases are what we hope all Qt users take a look and provide feedback. During the Beta phase they key goal is to address as much as possible the issues hindering using Qt 6.0 – so the feedback from all Qt users is very important. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Qt 6.0 Supported Platforms and Modules</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For Qt 6.0, our focus is on the essential modules as well as a few selected add-ons. As always, with a new major release, we also do not have all the upcoming target configurations yet supported. After Qt 6.0, our goal is to release Qt 6.1, Qt 6.2 LTS, as well as multiple patch releases during 2021. These releases will provide support for additional add-on modules and target configurations. </span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6.0 supports the following modules:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Qt Core</span></li>
<li><span>Qt GUI</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Widgets</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Network</span></li>
<li><span>Qt QML</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick Controls</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick 3D</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Shader Tools</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick Timeline</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Wayland</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Wayland Compositor</span></li>
<li><span>Qt SVG</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Concurrent</span></li>
<li><span>Qt D-Bus</span></li>
<li><span>Qt OpenGL and Qt OpenGL Widgets (note different than in Qt 5)</span></li>
<li><span>Qt 3D</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Network Authorization</span></li>
<li><span>Qt SQL</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Printing Support</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Test</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Help</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>…and a few other ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Within the modules, some old APIs have been removed, and new APIs have been introduced. &nbsp;In case where the functionality is removed on purpose (deprecated in Qt 5.15), the application may need to be modified accordingly and we will prepare a migration guide to assist you. </span></p>
<p><span>Some modules that are present in Qt 5 are not listed above because:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>They are purposely removed (like Qt Script and Qt XML Patterns)</span></li>
<li><span>The functionality is part of other modules, so it is no longer needed as a separate module (like platform specific extras) </span></li>
<li><span>We plan to add those in later Qt 6.x feature releases (like Qt Multimedia, Qt Bluetooth and Qt Virtual Keyboard).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If your application depends upon functionality missing from Qt 6.0, it may be need to wait until a Qt 6.x release provides it. As an long term support release, Qt 5.15 LTS serves this use-case specifically, keeping your project maintained with new patch releases. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6.0 supports the majority of all desktop, mobile and embedded platforms. Due to our C++17 requirement, a up-to-date compiler is essential. Support for real-time operating systems, is planned to be on a ‘technology preview’ level, i.e. development and testing is possible. We’ll provide a more detailed roadmap for supported hosts and targets with the upcoming alpha and beta releases. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How can I try Qt 6.0?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We are developing Qt 6.0 together with the whole Qt community. The source code repositories are available, and everyone can join the development via the Qt Project. We have released regular snapshots of Qt 6.0 since June and continue towards the final. With the feature freeze now in place and Alpha approaching, the snapshots improve the usability for trying Qt 6.0. During the Beta phase, we hope that most of you will try out the snapshots, and provide us with feedback. </span></p>
<p><span>The Qt 6.0 snapshots are available via the Qt online installer. All you have to do is to enable the ‘Preview’ category. To gain access to the source code, simply clone from the Qt Project repositories – or use the source code packages that are available as part of the Qt 6.0 snapshot releases.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>I was recently reading through an appendix on Jacques Lacan’s <em>Seminar on “The Purloined Letter”</em> and was surpised to find a discussion of a problem that seemed to fundamentally be a programming exercise. These notes are the result of some exploration I did implementing Lacan’s discussion in the <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket Programming language</a> (a modern dialect of the Scheme programming language for those unfamiliar). This seemed to be quite a perfect fit since Lacan’s primary interest is in the role that “signifiers” play in our understanding of the world and Racket is a <em>symbolic</em> programming language that focuses on the manipulation of symbols to perform computation. The full code and original markdown for these notes can be found in <a href="https://github.com/willkurt/lacan-racket">this github repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-intro-to-lacan">A quick intro to Lacan</h2>
<p>Jacques Lacan’s <a href="https://www.lacan.com/purloined.htm"><em>Seminar on “The Purloined Letter”</em></a> * is a lecture that covers many of Lacan’s essential themes and is a great introduction to understanding the basics of Lacanian psychology. When abstracted out, many of Lacan’s ideas can be reasonably straightforward, however in the original context Lacan takes the audiences on a splendid journey through his thinking that, for the uninitiated, can be a bit confusing. There is an appendix to this Seminar a surprisingly quantitative and technical section in this lecture as printed in <em>Écrits</em> under the subsection titled <em>Introduction</em> which in fact follows after the transcript of the seminar.</p>
<p>* <em>note</em>: that link does not contain the full appendix that is discussed in these notes.</p>
<p>This Seminar focuses on a classic Edgar Allen Poe text, <a href="https://poestories.com/read/purloined">“The Purloined Letter”</a> which is a mystery centering on a stolen letter. Lacan uses this letter as classic example of the ‘primacy of the signified’. “What in the world does that mean!?” you might reasonably ask. Lacan was particularly interested in the different roles that the “signifier” and the “signified” play in our understanding of the world. In general we can think of the <em>signifier</em> as the “thing which points to something else” and the <em>signified</em> as the “thing pointed at”. Take for example this image:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://willkurt.github.io/lacan-racket/images/cat_ecrits.png" width="300" alt=""><figcaption>“A cat reading Lacan’s Écrits”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We would say that there is a “cat” in this image. The word “cat” would be the signifier and the cat itself would be the signified. Typically we tend to think of the <em>signfied</em> at the real thing, but Lacan was interested in how incredibly important the signfier itself is in our understanding of the world. He proclaims in the Seminar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I teach that the unconscious is the fact that man is inhabited by the signifier”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the original Poe story is about a stolen letter and a detectives quest to return the letter. Lacan uses this stolen letter an example of the power of the signifier. Even though the entire story is driven by this letter the reader never knows what the actual contents of the letter are. Lacan points out that not only do we not know, we don’t need to. The letter itself as a signifier is able to create all the drama and complexity this mystery needs.</p>
<h3 id="the-primacy-of-the-signifier">The primacy of the signifier</h3>
<p>For Lacan it is these signifiers, these symbols of things, that are in fact the reality of our unconcious life. That is we operate primarily in terms of symbols, not the least of which is language itself. As an example of the role these signifigers play, consider a statement such as “I am a male technologist”. It turns out there in a emoji specifically for this very idea:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://willkurt.github.io/lacan-racket/images/man_technologist.png" width="300" alt=""><figcaption>“Emoji are a great representation of the signifier”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now when I say “male technologist” you likely have a pretty good idea what I mean, but if we pick apart what these words mean we quickly find it is very tricky to point to what exactly I am signifying. For starters what does it mean to say that I am “male”? We can see this as expression of biological sex, but it also entrails notions of gender. What does it mean to be a “man”? You might be tempted to quickly make some statement about the number of X choromosomes, but even if that works for one technical definition of “male” it clearly doesn’t do enough to explain it in all or even most social occasions. The more we explore “maleness” the more we realize that being “male” is more a signifier that a signified, it is like an emoji that we can’t quite pin down exactly what it points to.</p>
<p>This is of course just one tiny example of how often times the signifier is what plays a primal role in our way of interacting with the world. Lacan also points out that there is one very important signifier in our contemporary existence, which is always something with points to something else, and yet nonetheless plays an essential role in our psychology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the signifier that most thoroughly annihilates every signifcation–namely, money”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a bit more exposition on Lacan take a look at my talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_dqEgtpgBg">“The Limits of Probability”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lacan-and-racket">Lacan and Racket</h2>
<p>To demonstrate just how powerful pure symobls can be Lacan give an example of a very simple symbol language which nonetheless has some very interesting properities. Given that Racket is a programming language focused specifically on symbol manipulation I thought it would be a really fun exercise to implement this specific example fo Lacan’s reasoning in Racket!</p>
<p>Racket is in the family of Lisp programming languages. One dominant feature of most Lisp dialects is that they focus on the programmer performing computation strictly through symbol manipulation. The allows the programmer to treat even programs themselves as inputs to other programs, which leads to some very powerful programming abstractions.</p>
<p>Given that Racket is one of the best examples of a contemporary symbolic programming language this is a great tool to explore in more detail the problem that Lacan is discussion. Implementing Lacan in Racket also makes is arguments much more clear and can help make some logic easier to reason about.</p>
<h3 id="freud-the-death-drive-and-the-repetition-compulsion">Freud, the death drive and the repetition compulsion</h3>
<p>Lacan starts what is essential an appendix to the Seminar by discussing Freud’s controversial writing <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em>. In this text Freud struggles with the question of the <em>repetition compulsion</em> (or automatism) in which patients repeatedly return to thinking about tramautic events in their lifes. Freud typically explains most of our behavior in terms libidinal desires, that is pleasure seeking, sexual urges. For Freud most of the complexity of human psychology is the way we resist these desires as part of our everyday lifes. The trouble is that if our behavior is driven exclusively by a pleasure instinct why would anyone be compelled to revisit painful experiences over and over again? Freud’s theoretical solution to this problem is the establishment of the idea of the ‘death drive’. Freud argues that human behavior is in fact driven by the conflict between our libido and this death drive (Eros and Thanatos). Understandably even Freud’s most ardent followers found this explaination a little difficult to digest.</p>
<h3 id="repition-compulsion-explained-through-the-symbolic-chain">Repition compulsion explained through the symbolic chain</h3>
<p>Lacan’s response is that while Freud’s solution is easily dismissed, the problem he describes does need some exploration. Lacan argues that the <em>autonomy of the symbolic</em> is enough to explain the repetition compulsion. What in the world is the “autonomy of the symbolic?” Lacan wants to show us that mere symbols and rules for creating those symbols can contain their own logic which can cause repitition without needing to refer to any more complicated system. From a standpoint of modern programming this is not at all surprising. Anyone who has writen a program has basically used symbols that have no intrinsic meaning and used the logic of these symobls create predictable behavior. This is why this is a particularly fun part of Lacan to implement in code!</p>
<p>To demonstrate this Lacan develops a very simple grammar from symobic manipulation to demonstrate the emergent rules that come from this. For Lacan this shows that we don’t need complex ideas like the death drive to explain the compulsion to repeat: symbols themselves can cause this. Lacan starts with two symbols + and - representing, abstractly, presents or absence respectively. In Racket we can represent a list of these symbosl likes this:</p>
<pre><code>'( + + - + + - - - +)</code></pre>
<p>He then creates some simple rules that can can be used to transform a sequence of three of these symbols into three new symbols <code>'(1 2 3)</code>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate Lacan’s rules we’ll implement series of racket functions that check whether or not a given string of <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> maps to the target symbol. Lacan, being Lacan, expresses these symbols in a more indirect way, but the following definitions will suffice to show Lacan’s larger point.</p>
<p>The symbol 1 is defined as either <code>+++</code> or <code>---</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-one? xs)
  (or (equal? xs '(+ + +))
      (equal? xs '(- - -))))
</code></pre>
<p>The symbol 2 can be <code>+--</code>, <code>-++</code>, <code>++-</code>, <code>--+</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-two? xs)
  (or (equal? xs '(+ - -))
      (equal? xs '(- + +))
      (equal? xs '(+ + -))
      (equal? xs '(- - +))))</code></pre>
<p>And the symbol 3 is <code>+-+</code> or <code>-+-</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-three? xs)
   (or (equal? xs '(+ - +))
       (equal? xs '(- + -))))</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to imagine a string of these <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> base representations and how they would be translated. To be clear, if we have 3 {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} symbols we can generate a single <code>1</code>,<code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> symbol, and if we have four {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} we can generate two symbols. To make this more clear (and allow you to play with this process) we will demonstrate this in Racket. Our encoder takes the list in 3 at a time and then generates new symbols from the set {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>, <code>3</code>} based on the rules we have. In racket we have implemented a function named <code>encode-1-3</code> which takes a {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} representation and encodes it as a 1-3 symbol representation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + +))
'(1)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + -))
'(1 2)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + - -))
'(1 2 2)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + - - -))
'(1 2 2 1)
&gt; </code></pre>
<p>At this point it’s worth noting that every string of {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} symbols can be encoded in exactly one sequence of {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,<code>3</code>} symbols. Something interesting happens when we try to go the other way. Just looking at our original symbol definitions we know …</p></div>

TypeScript’s purpose <em>is </em>to be compiled into JavaScript. There is more, perhaps to add to the confusion: JavaScript itself is valid TypeScript because <strong>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. </strong>You can simply change your <code>js</code> or <code>jsx</code> file to <code>ts</code> or <code>tsx</code> and congratulations! You’re writing in TypeScript.</p><p>If you understand the relationship between CSS and Sass, for example, you have a sense for what this means.</p><p>TypeScript was developed by Microsoft as an open source project in 2012. It offers a wealth of features that JavaScript does not offer. One of the most powerful features TypeScript has is robust ways of working with object types. TypeScript throws specific errors to help you debug. TypeScript also compiles into older versions of JavaScript, which allows your applications to be accessible by many browsers.</p><p>If you are not comfortable with JavaScript itself, I recommend learning JavaScript before diving into TypeScript.

We really like TypeScript for allowing us to focus on the main problem we’re solving and not on typs in an object’s property name. In TypeScript programs, the chances of getting runtime errors are substantially lower compared to code originally written in JavaScript. We also like that IDEs offer great TypeScript support and literally walk us through the maze of APIs from third-party libraries we use in projects.</p><p>— <em>TypeScript Quickly</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599373915601_4321"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617295949/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1617295949&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=5b0d81d5d6efb533b956d8ffbb961096"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1617295949&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1617295949" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599373915601_4388"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/359fxGV" target="_blank"><em>TypeScript Quickly</em></a><em> </em>by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev is a February 2020 Manning publication that is one of the most well-organized, clear, and practical books I have seen on TypeScript. Every chapter is clear and concise, and you know where you are going every step of the way.</p><p>This book is all about helping you become a more productive developer on web or standalone apps. The authors are practitioners, writing for practitioners — so the book outlines the process of building multiple apps using TypeScript and other popular libraries and frameworks. The book assumes knowledge in HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript already.</p><p>A challenge of teaching TypeScript is that TypeScript often doesn’t function alone. The language is often paired with another frontend framework like React or Angular. Like with other books, <em>TypeScript Quickly </em>decides to be opinionated by diving into frameworks as well.</p><p>As far as organization goes, <em>TypeScript Quickly </em>is one of the best. Its structure is clean and you know exactly what you are getting into every step of the way.</p><p><em>TypeScript Quickly </em>includes the following sections:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Part 1: Mastering the TypeScript syntax</strong>, which includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Chapter 1: Getting familiar with TypeScript</strong>, which includes the benefits of programming in TypeScript, Typescript vs JavaScript, how to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript, and how to work with the Visual Studio Code editor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 2: Basic and custom types, </strong>which includes declaring variables with types and using types in function declarations, declaring type aliases with the type keyword, and declaring custom types with classes and interfaces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 3: Object-oriented programming with classes and interfaces</strong>, which includes how class inheritance works, why and when to use abstract classes, how interfaces can force a class to have methods with known signatures without worry about implementation details, and what programming to interfaces means.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 4: Using enums and generics, </strong>which includes the benefits of using enums, the syntax for numeric and string enums, what generic types are for, and how to write classes, interfaces, and functions that support generics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 5: Decorators and advanced types</strong>, which includes what the TypeScript decorators are for, how to create a new type based on an existing one using mapped types, how conditional types work, and combining mapped and conditional types.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 6: Tooling</strong>, which includes debugging TypeScript code with the help of source maps, the role of linters, compiling and bundling TypeScript apps with Webpack, compiling TypeScript apps with Babel, and how to compile TypeScript with Babel and bundle it with Webpack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 7: Using TypeScript and JavaScript in the same project</strong></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Part 2: Applying TypeScript in a blockchain app</strong>, which includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Chapter 8: Developing your own blockchain app</strong>, which includes the principles of blockchain apps, what the hashing functions are for, what block mining is, and developing a simple blockchain-based app.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 9: Developing a browser-based blockchain node, </strong>which includes creating a web client for a blockchain, creating a small library for hash generation, and running ther blockchain web app and debugging TypeScript in the browser.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 10: Client-server communications using Node.js, TypeScript,a nd WebSockets</strong>, which includes why a blockchain may need a server, the longest chain rule, how to create a Node.js WebSocket server in TypeScript, and poractical uses of TypeScript interfaces, abstract classes, access qualifiers, enums, and generics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 11: Developing Angular apps with TypeScript</strong>, which includes a quick intro to the Angular framework, how to generate, build, and serve a web app written in Angular and TypeScript, and how Angular implements dependency injection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 12: Developing the blockchain client in Angular</strong>, which includes reviewing the code of the blockchain web client in Angular and how to run an Angular client that communicates with a WebSocket server.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 13: Devleoping React.js apps with TypeScript</strong>, which includes a quick intro to the React.js library, how React components use props and state, and how React components communicate with each other. </p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 14: Developing a blockchain client in React.js</strong>, which includes reviewing a blockchain web client written with React.js, how the React.js web client communicates with the WebSocket server, running a React app that works with two servers in dev mode, and splitting the UI of a blockchain client into components and arranging their communications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 15: Developing Vue.js apps with TypeScript</strong>, which includes a quick introduction to the Vue.js framework, how to …</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

ULA kicked the weekend off with a Delta IV Heavy launch of an NRO spy satellite. The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation. (<em>Ed., amusingly, this satellite was originally supposed to launch as a rideshare with SAOCOM-1B, but when that mission was delayed, Capella switched to Rocket Lab, which was then delayed by a July 4th failure, eventually launching just a few hours after the original mission.

September 6, 2020 | https://danielrapp.github.io/doppler/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://danielrapp.github.io/doppler/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
      
      <p>
        Recently I stumbled upon <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf">an interesting paper</a> for
        implementing motion sensing requiring no special hardware, <i>only a speaker and mic</i>! Unfortunately the paper didn't include
        code to test it, so I decided to reproduce it here on the web!
      </p>
      <video muted="" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="" width="700" height="300">
        <source src="https://danielrapp.github.io/doppler/example.ogv" type="video/ogg">
      </video>

      <h2>What is the doppler effect?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, what is the doppler effect?
        The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">doppler effect</a> is a physical phenomenom which affects waves in motion.
        The standard example is the effect on a fire engine siren as it quickly drives
        past. When it moves <i>towards</i> you the sound waves are compressed, and so the
        frequency becomes <i>higher</i>, and
        when it moves <i>away</i> from you the frequency becomes <i>lower</i>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This phenomenon actually has really wonderful applications in astronomy for figuring the speed
        at which galaxies are moving towards or away from us by looking at the frequency shift of light,
        but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, it's important to realize that the doppler effect would also occur
        if you were to run towards the siren, rather than the siren moving towards you.
        We'll use this principle in the next section.
      </p>

      <h2>Measuring the doppler effect</h2>
      <p>
        In order to measure the doppler effect for motion detection on a conventional computer,
        what you can do is send out a sinusoid at some known (inaudible) frequency, say, 20 kHz.
        If something is moving in the room, then, after the sinusoid has bounced around on the walls and into the microphone, the
        sound will shift in frequency. This can be measured by looking at the frequency spectrum
        in the nearby region of the 20 kHz tone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Note that you'll need to run Chrome with a fairly high speaker-volume for this to work optimally.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The frequency spectrum of the microphone input is plotted above. The peak towards the right
        is due to the 20 kHz tone we're sending out. Try <span data-note="440">whistling</span> to see the spectrum change.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Here's a closer look, zooming in on the 20 kHz region.
        Try moving your hand <i>towards</i>
        the mic/computer to see the bulge shift to <i>higher</i> frequencies, and
        <i>away</i> from the computer to see it shift to <i>lower</i> frequencies.
      </p>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Now for the fun applications!
      </p>

      <h3>Motion sensing</h3>
      <p>
        The most obvious application for this is motion sensing.
        Below I've calculated the left and right bandwidth of the 20 kHz
        region (defined as the number of frequencies to the left and right
        that are within 99.9% in amplitude of the 20 kHz tone).
        I've then attached their difference to the size of the box.
      </p>
      <canvas id="ball" width="700" height="100"></canvas>
      <p>
        The effect this produces is that when you move your hand <i>towards</i>
        the microphone, the box becomes smaller (you're <i>pushing</i>
        it inwards), and if you move your hand <i>away</i> from the microphone,
        the box becomes larger (you're <i>pulling</i> it outwards).
      </p>

      <h3>Scrolling</h3>
      
      <p>
        A cool application to motion sensing, as suggested by the
        <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf">SoundWave paper</a>,
        is scrolling (see the video above). Click below to try it out.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This implementation doesn't have the double-tap feature for reversing
        the scrolling-direction, instead it's just using the left and right bandwidth-difference.
        Thus if you want to scroll down you have to move your hand
        <i>quickly towards</i> the computer, and <i>slowly away</i> from the computer.
      </p>

      <h3>Theremin</h3>
      
      <p>
        We can also create an instrument with this by simply modulating
        the frequency of some base-tone, say at 440 Hz, based on the
        difference between the left and right bandwidth!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is reminiscent of a Theremin, in that you can contol
        sound by moving your hands in free space, yet different
        in that the Theremin is able to measure absolute distance from the base,
        whereas we can only measure relative motion.
      </p>

      <h2>Library</h2>
      <p>
        Did this give you any ideas? I also created <a href="https://github.com/DanielRapp/doppler">a small library</a> to play around with this.
        Just run
      </p>
        <pre><code>
  doppler.init(function(bandwidth) {
    var diff = bandwidth.left - bandwidth.right;
  });
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        to start experimenting.
      </p>

As a continuing post, I wrote about what I thought to be the future of Kubernetes audits – <strong>the dynamic backend</strong>. Only to find out, a couple of days before publishing my post, that the dynamic backend (also known as the <code>AuditSink</code> API object)  was entirely removed.</p><div><figure><img width="453" height="108" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png 453w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png" data-srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png 453w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1-300x72.png 300w"></figure></div><h2>What was it?</h2><p>The dynamic backend, first introduced in Kubernetes v1.13, was a third audit backend option. The first two being logging to a file and sending logs to a webhook – both defined via API server flags.</p><p>On the other hand, the dynamic backend introduced the ability to define a webhook endpoint dynamically. All you had to do is post the <code>AuditSink</code> object to the API server and you’re done. You could have also modify it at any point in time which was really cool!</p><p>The dynamic backend was a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes <em>alpha</em> feature</a>. The statistics regarding how many Kubernetes features eventually get discarded are unknown to me, but I can guess that this doesn’t happen often. This feature didn’t make it to GA (General Availability), and for me, at a very funny timing.</p><h2>Why was it removed?</h2><p>A few days ago, I got a notification from GitHub which stated that the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamic backend feature</a> has been closed, and will be removed in Kubernetes V1.19.</p><div><figure><img width="291" height="104" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-removed.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-removed.png"></figure></div><p>I asked around the Kubernetes slack channel to understand what happened, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-auth/c/aV_nXpa5uWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the explanation I got</a>:</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: the feature did not progress for the last 1.5 years since the group responsible for it couldn’t agree on it’s future.</p><div><figure><img src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png" alt="" width="580" height="217" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png 840w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-300x113.png 300w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-768x288.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png" data-srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png 840w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-300x113.png 300w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-768x288.png 768w"></figure></div><p>As you can see the removal of this feature happened for two main reasons:</p><ol><li>The logging and webhook backends both use a static policy file. It is supplied, as mentioned above, via an API server flag. As opposed to them, the dynamic backend policy was dynamic. The team leaders tried to understand what was the right approach to implement this but couldn’t reach an agreement. At the time, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/600#issuecomment-447636134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I also struggled to understand how will that feature work exactly</a>.</li><li>Performance and scalability issues were very common when using this feature. I noted it several times when writing my original post. Part of the issue here was that the policy wasn’t fine grained as it is for the other backends. This caused a lot of performance issue. I guess that behind the scenes this was a lot more complex.</li></ol><p>And that was that.</p><p>I guess that’s the price you pay when trying to cover the most recent developments in the cloud world.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Would you watch a movie without audio (on mute)? Not unless you want to yell across your living room at/to someone. Right?</p><p>That’s because the audio is such an essential part of watching a movie or a video. A deep baritone voice with a haunting background score can take a scene to a different level.</p><p>An example of this is my favorite scene from the movie “Shawshank Redemption.” In this scene, Andy Dufresne plays “Canzonetta sull’ aria” from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro” over the loudspeakers and enthralls his fellow inmates.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Hfe_1Fny-Q" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>You can “watch” this scene repeatedly with your eyes closed, ears open, max volume, and Morgan Freeman’s narration will do the rest.</p><h2 id="importance-of-audio-in-sports">Importance of Audio in Sports</h2><p>Anyone who has ever watched South American football/soccer will recognize the quintessential “gooooooaaaaaaal” from the commentators every time a goal is scored. Here is a clip of South American football -</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UioCvLN-370" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>But, what you <strong>also might have noticed is the noise of the crowd</strong> - all those fans screaming, cheering, hooting for their teams, and booing at the opposing teams.</p><p>This is what constitutes a home-ground advantage, right? Having a boisterous crowd yelling at the top of their voices and intimidating the opposition! It’s an integral part of large sporting events and is one reason people pay a lot of money to watch sports.</p><p>The right atmosphere counts!</p><h2 id="crowds-during-a-pandemic">Crowds during a pandemic?</h2><p>But, where are the crowds in a pandemic-stricken world? Leagues across Europe are making their way back with strict rules and regulations to prevent players and support staff from contracting and spreading the contagious COVID-19 virus.</p><p>Players apparently don’t shake hands, their change rooms are sanitized before and after matches, and the most significant change of them all - there are no crowds! Games will be played behind “closed doors” without any crowds and with minimal support and ground staff.</p><p>An inadvertent consequence of this decision is <strong>the absence of crowd noises</strong>. Imagine this for a minute -</p><blockquote><p>You have two teams battling it out on the field, the camera crew is capturing the event, and your audience is watching the live stream …. but without the crowd’s noise.</p></blockquote><p><strong>In other words, a terrible experience.</strong></p><h2 id="augmented-audio--fake-noise">Augmented Audio / Fake Noise</h2><p>DAZN is trying to add “augmented audio” for the Bundesliga matches and has created a Crowd-DJ position in their office!!</p><p>DAZN <a href="https://media.dazn.com/en/blog/2020/07/meet-the-bundesliga-crowd-dj/">said</a>, and I quote -</p><p><em>When the Bundesliga announced its return in early May, we immediately began exploring ways to create the most immersive experience for fans at home.</em></p><p><strong>When I read this, it sounded similar to</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/1/20676854/electric-cars-artificial-safety-noise-low-speeds-european-union-rules-2019-2021"><strong>car manufacturers trying to add some artificial noise to their electric vehicles because they were too silent</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p>So, what DAZN did was break down the problem of augmented audio into small pieces and tackle them one at a time. A brilliant move!</p><ul><li>DAZN first <strong>recorded an empty stadium’s ambient noise</strong>, which forms the absolute baseline upon which you would layer other noises.</li><li>They then extracted the noises made by t<strong>he crowds, the players and coaches</strong>, and instances of goals, fouls, yellow, and red cards from their digital archives of the past years.</li><li>DAZN mentions that they also created a <strong>5-min clip of the crowd devoid of chanting</strong> <strong>and sudden noises</strong> and looped that clip throughout the match. They discovered that anything less than 5 minutes would probably be discovered as fake noise! Very interesting indeed.</li></ul><p>After gathering these clips, they had to enlist the services of an engineer who played the role of a <strong>“Crowd DJ."</strong> The crowd DJ’s job was to mix the noises at the right times to recreate the feeling that the game is being played in front of an actual crowd.</p><h2 id="is-augmented-audio-the-way-forward">Is Augmented Audio the way forward?</h2><p>I think it is if this pandemic continues without any vaccines coming out soon. <strong>Apart from this, the learnings that will come out of such experiments are invaluable.</strong></p><h3 id="audio-latency-problems">Audio Latency Problems?</h3><p>There are issues that anyone venturing into fake-noise/augmented audio has to consider, and the prime among them (in my opinion) is <strong>“audio latency."</strong> I would say this is similar to lip-sync issues that are SO annoying, but, in the case of fake noise for sporting events, audio latency would kill the viewing experience.</p><p>For example, imagine the following just happened.</p><blockquote><p>1 min for the game to end, and Ronaldo has the ball. He is tearing down the field and kicks the ball, which curves prodigiously and misses the goal by mere inches.</p></blockquote><p>In a real match, the <strong>sighs</strong> and the “oooh” s from the crowd would occur almost immediately after the goal was missed. This would be followed by loud cheering from the opposition.</p><p>But, in augmented audio, <strong>either the crowd-DJ gets the timing right or misses it completely</strong>. If the crowd-DJ adds the <em>“ooohs” and the “boos”</em> 3 seconds after the ball went past the goal, the experience is probably going to be worse than Ronaldo missing the goal in the first place!</p><p><strong>Only time and experience will tell if augmented audio / fake-noise will be a mainstay in the sports broadcasting industry.</strong></p></div><p>🔔 Subscribe <a href="https://ottverse.com/subscribe">via email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OttVerse" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ottverse" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to get notified of the latest articles published on OTTVerse.com.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>If you’ve been following me over the last few months, you would most certainly know how many internet related issues I’ve been having since the start of 2020.</p>

<h2 id="if-not-lets-quickly-recap-from-the-very-beginning-of-our-internet-situation-at-home-in-south-africa">If not, let’s quickly recap from the very beginning of our internet situation at home in South Africa…</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1999</strong>: Get Dial Up for the first time. I think it was an <a href="https://www.mweb.co.za/">Mweb</a> Big Black Box or something like that. I was only allowed to use the internet between 7pm and 7am and weekends. I think calls were unlimited for R7 during those hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2007</strong>: Our area finally got ADSL. 384kbps, capped at 2gb per month. Considering now our daily usage is about 5-10gb, clearly streaming wasn’t big then.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2010</strong>: Upgrade to 4mbps ADSL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2013</strong>: Upgrade to 10mbps ADSL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2018</strong>: Copper cable theft started becoming extremely common. During one month, it got stolen about 6 times, leaving us offline almost the whole month. We had no choice but to switch over to a Fixed LTE network called Rain, via an ISP called Afrihost. It was a great switch (at the time). Wireless cannot get stolen. Fast too - constantly 20-30mbps, rarely experiencing any downtime. Capped at 220gb, but more than enough for our family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2020</strong>:  And then 2020 came along, where I would notice at certain times of the day it would drop to less than 1mbps at certain times of the day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.speedtest.net/result/9064720593.png" alt="0.15Mbps speedtest result"></p>

<p>Contacted Afrihost customer support a few times, but they always blame it on the wifi even though we know for a fact it’s most certainly not the issue, as it only happens at certain times of the day and are always fine in the evenings.</p>

<p>Turns out the reason is the network highly congested - I was on a fixed capped LTE product, paying R1350 per month and then Rain secretly launched a new product, unlimited LTE between 11pm to 6pm (19 hours), at R250 per month. Instead of migrating me as a Fixed LTE user onto another network, perhaps with higher QoS, I suddenly shared this network with the hundreds on the cheap R250 network, which is why my speeds dropped so dramatically outside of 6pm and 11pm. The R250 guys get cut off after 6pm and 11pm and then I have the network all to myself basically - but still, I’m paying for a 24/7 service, it shouldn’t only be usable for 4 hours a day.</p>

<p>I eventually setup my little Linux server at home to perform a speed test every hour and save the results onto a DB. I then graphed out the results on a little React App that I called <a href="https://www.rainspeedtest.co.za/"><strong>Rain Speedtest</strong></a> - I even registered a domain for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.ronaldlangeveld.com/assets/images/rain_speedtest.png" alt="Rain Speedtest"></p>

<p>I ended up sharing this with some friends, customer support and on a few forums. To this day it still get a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>After sending the speedtest data to Rain and Afrihost, they eventually admitted the local LTE tower is extremely congested and there is nothing they can/will do about it. Afrihost eventually helped me out and sent me a new router + sim card for the MTN Network, the caveat is that it’s capped at 150gb, so now I have to be even more careful with data.</p>

<p>Although not a permanent solution as its capped, at least it gives me a stable connection, that doesn’t go as slow as Rain. It does sometime, become slow, but usually quite solid.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.speedtest.net/result/9296185363.png" alt="90Mbps"></p>

<p>My permanent solution would be to get Fibre… After about 8 months and 100+ emails with multiple Fibre Network Operators, I finally got a company to install Fibre in our area. That will be my next blog post and how you can get that to happen if you don’t have FTTH in your neighbourhood yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Like many people, I have most of my best ideas in the shower.</p><p>This is sometimes annoying: I could use more than one shower’s worth of good ideas a day, but I’d rather not end up as a shrivelled yet insightful prune. Mostly, though, shower ideas are the incentive that keeps me smelling okay, so I grudgingly accept the constraint.</p><p>The time when it was most constraining was the first time I became a manager. I only had a few reports, so managing them wasn’t a full-time job. But I was very bad at it, and so it <em>should have</em> been what I spent all my shower insights on.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was spending my non-management time on programming. And even if I tried to use my showers to think about my thorny and awkward people issues, my mind somehow always wandered off to tackle those nice, juicy software design problems instead.</p><p>Management Attempt #1 didn’t go very well; being distracted by programming, I made lots of embarrassing mistakes that made my reports’ lives harder, which in turn made me feel stressed and guilty. I ended up bouncing back to being an individual contributor after a few months.</p><p>That experience of mine resonates strongly with Byrne Hobart’s <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/the-future-of-remote-work-is-not" target="_blank">observation about focus in knowledge work</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:</p><ol><li><p>&lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.</p></li><li><p>10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises.</p></li><li><p>50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>“50%+ focus” is roughly when something becomes <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html" target="_blank">the top idea in your mind</a>. It’s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It’s when you start habitually asking “how could this go faster?” It’s when you get <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html" target="_blank">relentlessly resourceful</a>. It’s around when you start <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/">annoying your coworkers and/or significant other</a>, although that part is avoidable with practice.</p><p>Most importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.</p><p>I’ve found a few different strategies that help me with this:</p><h3 id="care-viscerally">Care viscerally</h3><p>It’s hard to recruit 50%+ of your brain to work on something just because you feel like you “should” do it. Your superego might listen to this newfangled “logic” and “reason” stuff, but the monkey-era parts of your brain can’t be fooled so easily. To be reliably able to focus on something, you need to be intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome.</p><p>For me, that’s not automatic—for instance, even though <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/work/">I’m incredibly excited about what Wave is doing</a>, my day-to-day motivation gets worse if I work remotely for too long without visiting our operations in Senegal. Unless I can periodically see for myself that people are using the things we’re building, it starts feeling a little bit fake, like the so-called “real world” is a simulation that I can only communicate with via Slack channels and <code>git push</code>.</p><h3 id="monotask">Monotask</h3><p>As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.</p><p>In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I’d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner’s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/#startups">faster compounding growth</a>.</p><h3 id="evade-obligations">Evade obligations</h3><p>As a manager, it became impossible to “only work on one thing:” there were too many small tasks and too many projects going on in parallel. But I have a similar principle: I can only have one <em>obligation to other people</em>. “Give advice on this project?” Whenever you want! “Review my 1,000-line change?” Only if review isn’t blocking you from shipping it. “Check in every so often to make sure this doesn’t go off the rails?” Sorry, I have to, uh, powder my nose. “Figure out what the process should be?” I’ll get back to you in a couple years. (The best process is no process, right?)</p><p>During Management Attempt #1, my programming project distracted me so much because other people cared a lot that I finished it—if I ever had to de-prioritize it, I would make those people sad. This made it take up my attention (by worrying about letting people down) even when I wasn’t working on it. Unfortunately, since management work comes in urgent bursts, I’d often end up in a situation where I had to delay either the programming or the management—i.e., choose between making two different sets of people sad—and in those cases it was very hard for me to control my focus.</p><p>Now that I’ve noticed this, I allow myself to contribute to multiple things in parallel, as long as they don’t tax my object permanence skills—if I totally forgot about this project today, would anything bad happen? As long as the answer is no (usually because someone else is the one taking initiative to move things forward), I can be pretty sure that project won’t try to colonize my brain in the shower.</p><h3 id="timebox-bullshit">Timebox bullshit</h3><p>Even if I have only one major project that other people depend on, I somehow always end up with a bunch of minor chores to do—responding to emails, deflecting secondary obligations, buying household necessities, powdering my nose, filing expense reports, etc.</p><p>For these, I employ a “bullshit timebox”—a one-hour period a few times a week when I do <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank">all the things life is too short for</a>. During the remaining 165 hours per week, I do my resolute best not to think about any of the bullshit, no matter how much people bug me about whether a <a href="https://thume.ca/2019/03/03/my-tungsten-cube/" target="_blank">1.5” tungsten cube</a> is really a legitimate work expense.</p><p>In order for bullshit not to distract me for the rest of the week, I try to minimize my number of “open loops”—projects or processes that I’ve started but not completed. Much like how I single-task on programming until it’s done, I’ll make phone calls instead of email threads, or, God forbid, texts or instant messaging. It took a while for me to train my friends not to instant message me, but by now they remember my rants about how distracting it is, practically word-for-word.</p><hr><p>Management Attempt #2 didn’t go great for me either. But I finally did an okay job at Management Attempt #3. Part of this was because I avoided repeating the particular mistakes of Attempts #1 and #2. But part of it was that on Attempt #3, our engineering team grew quickly enough that I went from “no managing” straight to “full-time managing” with no transitional period in which to be distracted, screw up and be miserable.</p><p>Once I was full-time managing, I had no shiny distractions and was able to spend my showers focusing on how to be a better manager. And once I was 50%+ focused, well, I haven’t become a “superstar 10x manager” yet, but I quickly stopped being 0.1x.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>
through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>defonce</span> <span>net</span> <span>(</span>init! <span>(</span>net-bp <span>:adam</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That's it! The network is ready to learn.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<p>
Should I mention that the book <a href="https://aiprobook.com/deep-learning-for-programmers/">Deep Learning for Programmers: An Interactive Tutorial with
CUDA, OpenCL, DNNL, Java, and Clojure</a> teaches the nuts and bolts of neural networks and deep learning
by showing you how Deep Diamond is built, <b>from scratch</b>? In interactive sessions. Each line of code
can be executed and the results inspected in the plain Clojure REPL. The best way to master something is to build
it yourself!
</p>

<p>
It' simple. But fast and powerful!

    <p>Understanding OAuth2 and OpenID Connect</p>
    <br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>There seems to be a lot of confusion around <span>OAuth2</span> and <span>OpenID Connect</span>
        (<span>OIDC</span> for short). In this article, we will go on a journey to understand and clarify what
        OAuth2 and OIDC really are.</p>
      <p>Alice is hosting a party and wants to send an invite a select group of friends. She plans to send a digital invitation via
        a site called <span>KoolInvitez</span>. The site needs a list of emails to send out the invitation. Alice stores
        all her contacts (as a collection of groups) in a site called <span>EzGroupContacts</span>. How should Alice
        provide access to the group called 'CloseFriends' in EzGroupContacts to KoolInvitez to send the invites ??? Should Alice
        provide her credentials for EzGroupContacts to KoolInvitez so it can access the contacts in the group 'CloseFriends' ???
        This is a security <span>anti-pattern</span> and *<span>NOT</span>* recommended. This is
        where OAuth2 comes in handy. Think of OAuth2 as a way of handing someone a <span>Valet</span> key, who will
        have limited access to perform their task. In other words, OAuth2 is an open standard for users to grant access to their
        information on a site or application to another site, but without revealing their credentials.</p>
      <p>OIDC, on the other hand, is an extension on top of OAuth2, that is used to verify the identify of a user (authentication)
        in a standard way. As an example, there are many sites that do not have any user registration and rely on Google or Facebook
        for identity verification (authentication).</p>
    </div>
    <p>Before we go any further, let us define some terms that will be useful in the context of OAuth2 and OIDC as follows:</p>
    <table id="col2-table">
      <thead><tr>
        <th>Term</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Resource</span></td>
          <td>Data or information that a user owns (Ex: the contact list 'CloseFriends')</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Resource Owner</span></td>
          <td>The owner of a Resource (Ex: Alice)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Resource Server</span></td>
          <td>The server where the Resource is hosted (Ex: EzGroupContacts)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Client</span></td>
          <td>An application or a site that needs access to a user Resource (Ex: KoolInvitez)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Authorization Server</span></td>
          <td>The OAuth2/ODIC server where a user grants a consent to a Client, to access their Resource(s)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Access Token</span></td>
          <td>A security token which the Client can present to the Resource Server to get access to a user's
            Resource</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Front Channel</span></td>
          <td>Requests coming from a user agent (such as a web browser) to a server</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Back Channel</span></td>
          <td>Requests coming from a server to another server. This is done for security reasons</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The basic *<span>FUNDAMENTAL</span>* flow of OAuth2 is referred to as the <span>Autorization
        Code</span> flow and all the other flows are variations of this basic flow. The Auorization Code flow works as follows:</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>1</span> :: the Resource Owner launches the Client to initiate the flow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>2</span> :: the Client makes a request to the Authorization Server from the Front Channel for an
            authorization code (<span>/auth_code</span>) passing in an URL to respond back to (<span>/callback
            </span>) at the Client</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>3</span> :: the Authorization Server redirects the Resource Owner to the Resource Server for user
            authentication and access grant</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>4</span> :: the Resource Owner enters valid credentials that is verified by the Resource Server and
            redirects back to the Authorization Server</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>5</span> :: the Authorization Server generates an Authorization Code and responds back to the Client
            with the authorization code on the Back Channel at the specified URL (<span>/callback</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>6</span> :: the Client makes a request to the Authorization Server for an Access Token through the
            Back Channel</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>7</span> :: the Authorization Server responds back to the Client with an Access Token on the Back
            Channel</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>8</span> :: the Client uses the Access Token to make a request to access the Resource at the Resource
            Server</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>9</span> :: the Resource Server responds with the data associated with the Resource</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the basic Authorization Code flow:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p><a href="https://app.qvault.io/">My team</a> has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a different experience.</p>

<h3>What’s the digital equivalent of sticky notes?</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Hey</p>



<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>

<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>



<center>—</center>



<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows. These could be quick reminders to add permissions to new calendar events or to use Filtered Views in Google Sheets. You could also use these notes to train users on keyboard shortcuts.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/relief.png"></p><p>You could imagine employers shipping corporate laptops with pre-installed notes to make it easier to transfer (previously tacit) knowledge and thus improve the onboarding process for new hires.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Notes</p>



<p>I could go on and on …</p></div></div>

Adults should work and be adults.&nbsp;</p><p>Or should they?</p><p>That’s how most people behave and go through life. We are not being us but behaving according to societal expectations and norms. We are what society expects us to be at that age.</p><p>I refuse to believe this.&nbsp;</p><p>I was already a kid and I had an interesting childhood. And I can’t tell you much about adulthood because, well, I’m not there yet. In this essay, I will focus on the teenage years and why some teens you should not chill out and <em>just be a teenager.</em></p><p>When you are a teenager, you go to high school and study to get ready for college. If you’re mildly ambitious, you play sports. If you’re somewhat ambitious, you enroll in extracurricular activities in school. If you’re ambitious, you’d play sports and take part in extracurricular activities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">crazy ambitious,</a> you do all the above and go beyond like starting companies, nonprofits, public speaking, etc. You are on a different wavelength of life. Somehow, certain kids break out of the normal way of being and <em>think differently.&nbsp;</em></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/tyler-cowen-production-function" target="_blank">North Star Podcast interview</a>, the economist Tyler Cowen is asked why there aren’t more Tyler Cowens in the world. He says:</p><blockquote><p>You have to ask at some point, what are the <strong>returns</strong> both to <strong>starting early </strong>and to <strong>continuing fairly late</strong> in life? So starting early, you give up a <strong>normal childhood.</strong> I would say all for the better. Awesome. Bring it on. Let's double down on that one. But most people don't want to do that, or it just doesn't occur to them. They might in fact do it if they saw more<strong> role models.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I also gave up a “normal childhood.” I didn’t think about the returns or anything like that, I thought about what makes me happy, what makes me curious, and what makes me.&nbsp;</p><p>“But those crazy ambitious kids are dumb. They should just go out with friends, go to parties, make silly mistakes, and be a freaking teenager.” Hell yeah! Again, why bother?</p><p>If you have goals, there’s no need to pursue them. If you have passions, pursue them later. If you have curiosities, bro I don’t even know what those are.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll have time…</p><p>Adults tell you should be a teen and enjoy these years. And don’t even worry about doing something too hard or complicated. After all, “you should be a teenager.”&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t, these adults tell you that you will regret it. So what? Just be and do what you’re supposed to do, watch TV, use your phone, and follow the path of everyone else mindlessly. By the way, don’t forget to be happy [1].</p><p>But who are these adults? They are adults who aren't enjoying adulthood. They look back to when they were kids with no responsibilities. What if we checked with adults who love adulthood? You’ll get a different story.&nbsp;</p><p>You have the same experiences that everyone has at the expense of extraordinary experiences you can create for yourself such as creating a project, starting a company, building your own video game, and sharing your gifts with the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Hold up. What are you talking about? “You should be a teenager, don’t do any of that. That’s not cool. If you don’t try too hard and enjoy your childhood, you’ll be happy.” Right, right. Thanks for your advice.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are a few teens out there who think differently and imagine a world of opportunities where age, credentials, or money isn’t a limiting factor, but an <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/leverage"><span>advantage</span></a>. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who rule the world. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who make things happen. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who you look up to.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps I made the wrong choice and I should’ve been a normal kid. But I couldn’t be that. I simply couldn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t about me or anyone else. This is about you. Ask yourself, What are your goals?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  <p>As the 2020 US Presidential election grinds on, it makes me wonder if we need to unlearn the idea of a Nation State. The assumption that geographically collocated people share the same core identity and values seems quaint in just about every nation state these days. If we unlearn this increasingly fallacious idea, we might open ourselves up to something new.</p>

<p>I live in a small, Virginia college town, Charlottesville. We share increasingly little in common with people living 30 miles away. With no shared values, not even a shared perspective of what’s true, it makes little sense to share political institutions. We live in different worlds - I bet many Charlottesvillians could navigate the London Tube with greater ease than the streets of nearby Dillwyn or Buena Vista. The interaction between these groups occurs purely on economic lines, often in <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/09/10/america-has-two-economies-and-theyre-diverging-fast/">two parallel economies</a>.</p>

<p>Even more, if you put me in a room with a random Berliner or Londoner, It’s likely we would share a similar positive attitude towards diversity and inclusion. We’d enjoy similar sources of culture and entertainment, perhaps even curious about each other’s weird sports. There’s probably even a greater likelihood we’d discuss political ideas with an open mind. Indeed, I’ve had more conversations about Brexit with a British person than about Trump with a Trump supporter. Increasingly, we have a shared outlook with other educated, urban places around the world. We feel alien to fellow Americans, Brits, or Germans that live a stone’s throw away.</p>

<p>Instead of different nation states, the world’s turning into one big emerging city with a large, vast, global hinterland. With the Internet and easy air travel - Manhattan, SOHO, and Pankow feel like different neighborhoods in the same global city – not identical, but increasingly cut from a similar cloth. All supporting increasingly culturally aligned knowledge workers. Some places (like a college town, or small city) feel less ‘central’ to the emerging one-global-city, similar to an outer suburb. Some places seem much more central (Manhattan?). And certainly the ‘neighborhoods’ I know about are more culturally nearby. But that will certainly change over the 21st century as places (and people) sort themselves closer or farther from the center. (And even in a ‘remote centric’ world, this’ll be true, as we need places with good Internet and comparable social values)</p>

<p>The hinterlands deeply resent the emerging, educated, cosmopolitan one-global-city. Certainty, this had a lot to do with Trump being elected. Fear that a multicultural knowledge economy might trump nation state protected privileges runs deep. This fear underpins much of the anti-intellectualism and anti-immigration extremism in these groups. Notably Trump also seems to evoke a kind of nostalgia about an 80s era strong American nation state and criticizes opponents for supporting “open borders” and not being “true Americans”. This division between one-global-city nation-state-first perspectives goes beyond the US. It’s happening in Poland, Turkey, Germany and just about everywhere.</p>

<p>If we unlearn the nation state, we might begin to see this emerging, new society. Some might be brave enough to embrace it as an explicit, core ideology. This might let us build new institutions centered on this one-global-city. The closest institutions we have right now are heavily globalized tech companies . They explicitly work to build multi-national workforces, heavily aware of the inclusion and multiculturalism needed to pull something like this off. Certainly methods of collaborating in tech, such as sharing code on Github, and participating in common communities also underpins the one-global-city. Social media might provide a kind of hub for the one-global-city (as well as the disaffected).</p>

<p>But there’s reasons to be skeptical too. As the one-global-city develops, it will push more and more marginalized people out to the hinterlands. A one-global-city with aligned / same political institutions is perhaps an educated elite fiction. Or if it exists, it’s not morally superior to a nation state that looks out for all it’s citizens. A one-global-city might turn into a caste society, with upper class tech / knowledge workers and then everyone else. We’ll continue to live in an awkward economic sybmiosis. Like two species that both need and hate each other. Always at low-level of conflict, but not enough to blow out into some massive war.</p>

<p>Maybe, in the end, it’s the one-global city – the globalized, neo-liberal, New World Order that will need to be unlearned. Perhaps, it’s the hinterlands that will tame their elites - attenuating their ability to connect with the rest of the world. Nation states reassert themselves as explicitly anti-intellectual, parochial entities. Sometimes choosing ignorance and isolation to maintain national sovereignty.</p>

<p>Who knows? It’ll be interesting to observe the rest of my life to maybe find out?</p>

<p>Choosing good colors for your charts is hard. This article tries to make it easier.</p>
<p>I want you to feel more confident in your color choices. And if you have no sense for colors at all, here’s my attempt to help you find good ones anyway. We’ll talk about common color mistakes I see out there in the wild, and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>This is not the right article for you if you’re trying to find good gradients or shades. But if you need to find beautiful, distinctive colors for different <strong>categories (e.g. continents, industries, bird species)</strong> for your line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, etc., read on.</p>

<p>I will mention saturation, brightness and hue a lot. The HSB (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>B</strong>rightness) or HSV (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>V</strong>alue) color spaces work fairly well to check them:</p>

<li><strong>Saturation</strong> ranges from 0% (grey) to 100% (super duper colorful!!): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
<li><strong>Brightness/Value</strong> ranges from 0% (black) to 100% (the actual color): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To convert your colors from HEX (e.g. <code>#cc0000</code>) or RGB (e.g. <code>rgb(207, 176, 58)</code>) to HSB/HSV, use a tool like <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>colorizer.org</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A relative of HSB/HSV is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCL</a> color space. It uses the same parameters (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>C</strong>hroma = saturation, <strong>L</strong>ightness), but is closer to “how we really see colors”. <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/255-how-to-pick-colors-in-datawrapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Datawrapper</strong> uses the HCL color space</a> for its color picker:</p>
<p><img alt="HCL color picker in Datawrapper" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors31.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors31.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors31.png"></p>
<p>But since you won’t find HCL in Adobe Photoshop or <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colorizer.org</a>, every time I mention degrees (like 0°) or percentages, I’ll be talking about the HSB/HSV color space.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s do this:</p>

<h4 id="Broaden-your-understanding-of-colors">Broaden your understanding of colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors30.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors30.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors30.png"></p>
<p>You might think like this: “I need five colors for my chart. So I use green and yellow and blue and red. And …um…maybe orange? Or purple!”</p>
<p>If you haven’t thought much about colors since you were a kid coloring out your coloring book, this thought makes sense. So today I’m here to tell you: They are more colors than that.</p>
<p>Look at this graphic and compare them with the basic colors <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors13.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png"><em><a href="https://whydocatsanddogs.com/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why do Cats and Dogs?</a> by Nadieh Bremer</em></p>
<p>They’re different. The red that Nadieh uses <span>⬤</span> is different from your typical red <span>⬤</span>. The green <span>⬤</span> is…can you even call it a green <span>⬤</span>?</p>
<p>So before we impose rules that limit us, let me freak you out a bit: There are thousands of colors you can use. There is yellow-ish red <span>⬤</span> and blue-ish red <span>⬤</span> and everything in between. There is grey <span>⬤</span>, but there is also cold grey <span>⬤</span> and there is warm grey <span>⬤</span>. And then there is blue. So much blue! Like this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span> and this <span>⬤</span>. And we haven’t even talked about orange and yellow.</p>
<p>You have <em>lots</em> of options. Which means you can stay in a small area of the color wheel and still have many options. Which means:</p>

<h4 id="Don’t-dance-all-over-the-color-wheel">Don’t dance all over the color wheel</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors28.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors28.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors28.png"></p>
<p>There’s no need to rely on hues from all around the color wheel like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> for your visualizations. It will look more professional – and therefore more trustworthy – when it only uses a few hues and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Here’s where it becomes a good idea to actually look at a color wheel. You can use <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a> or <a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> to do so.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors21.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors21.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors21.png"><em><a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> harmonies</em></p>
<p>Lots of these tools let you choose different harmonies. One of them is called “square” or “tetradic”. <strong>Don’t use it.</strong> It will result in too many hues –&nbsp;and we’re on a mission to avoid that.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
  <source src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/200805_goodcolors20.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>In the video above, I used the color tool <a href="https://paletton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paletton</a> to start with a tetradic harmony and then decrease the distance. Note how more beautiful the color combinations become.</p>
<p>If the distance becomes small enough, you’re basically using <strong>complementary</strong> colors. And that’s a great choice! Lots of complementary color pairs work awesome together. <strong>If in doubt, use complementary colors and their neighbors.</strong></p>
<p>So let’s do this –&nbsp;this time with Adobe Color:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors22.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors22.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors22.png"><em>Our complementary colors in <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a></em></p>
<p>Our colors are opposite each other on the color wheel, so they’re clearly complementary. Yay! But they’re also unusable: The two oranges are way too similar. And everything looks so…bright.</p>
<p>There’s where we need to change the saturation and lightness:</p>

<h4 id="Use-saturation-and-lightness-to-make-your-hues-work">Use saturation and lightness to make your hues work</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors27.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors27.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors27.png"></p>
<p>Saturation and brightness are as important as hue. In fact, you can create new colors when you just change the saturation and brightness. Here are two color pairs with the same hue, just different saturation and lightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. (If you change the hue just a tiny bit, you’ll achieve even better results: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.)</p>
<p>Let’s come back to our color combination: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. After playing around with the saturation and darkness, it becomes this:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors23.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors23.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors23.png"><em>Our better (!) complementary colors in <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a></em></p>
<p>I desaturated the light blue <span>⬤</span> and the lighter orange <span>⬤</span> and made every color darker except the lighter orange. Heck yeah, we can work with that!</p>
<p>So if your color combination doesn’t look awesome yet, don’t immediately add another hue. <strong>Change the saturation and lightness first and see if that’s better.</strong></p>
<p>That’s what I did to all of these color palettes: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. They’re all roughly complementary, and they all come with different saturations and lightness. That’s what makes them work.</p>

<h4 id="Use-warm-colors-blue">Use warm colors &amp; blue</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors29.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors29.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors29.png"></p>
<p>There’s a complementary color combination that is especially loved by data visualization designers: <strong>yellow/orange/red and blue</strong>. Scroll through graphics portfolios like the one from the <a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a> or this one by <a href="https://infographics.economist.com/2019/AChristmasGiftForYou/AYearInGraphicDetail.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist (PDF)</a> and you’ll notice that they use these colors far more often than colors like purple or green.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors19.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors19.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors19.png"><em><a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three pages by The South China Morning Post</a></em></p>
<p>That’s because these warm colors and blue are super versatile for categories. Yellow and orange and red look very pleasing together, but people will still perceive them as different colors: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> –&nbsp;which is exactly what we want for categorical colors. And blue is more flexible than any other hue: Lots of blues, no matter if dark <span>⬤</span> or light <span>⬤</span> or saturated <span>⬤</span> or not saturated <span>⬤</span>, look pleasing, calming and professional.</p>
<p>And they are accessible: colorblind people can easily distinguish blue and orange/red from each other.</p>
<p>So if in doubt, use an orange/red with blue.</p>

<h4 id="When-using-green-make-it-a-yellow-or-blue-one">When using green, make it a yellow or blue one</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors26.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors26.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors26.png"></p>
<p>Forest green covers a full sixth on the color wheel, from approximately 90° <span>⬤</span> to 150° <span>⬤</span>, with 120° as its peak <span>⬤</span>. However, you will find few well-designed visualizations that use it. Why is that?</p>
<p>First, forest green is just very dark. And lightening up the forest green means going into an awkward neon <span>⬤</span>. So you need to lighten up <em>and</em> desaturate green enormously – more than other colors –&nbsp;to get to a nice one. That’s exactly what the Washington Post does with their green <span>⬤</span> here:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors17.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors17.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors17.png"><em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-rolling-back-obama-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Trump is rolling back Obama’s legacy<br>
</a> by The Washington Post</em></p>
<p>It’s a 142° green, but only 14% saturated. Here’s what the same hue with the same brightness would look like 100% saturated: <span>⬤</span>. Yikes.</p>
<p>And remember our colorblind friends: A pure green in combination with red, orange or brown is hard for them to distinguish.</p>
<p>So when using green, make it a bit yellow or a bit blue. You can see this in the examples at the top of this article: All of the greens except FiveThirtyEight’s one <span>⬤</span> have a hue greater than 160° (=bluer) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> or lower than 60° (=more yellow) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. Nadieh uses both yellow green and blue green in this project we’ve already seen:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors13.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png"><em><a href="https://whydocatsanddogs.com/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why do Cats and Dogs?</a> by Nadieh Bremer</em></p>
<p>Looks like you can use them in your visualization as two different colors as Nadieh does: Win-win!</p>

<h4 id="Avoid-pure-colors">Avoid pure colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors5.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors5.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors5.png"></p>
<p>“Pure” hues are the ones that are located at exactly 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° or 360°/0° in the color wheel:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors7.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors7.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors7.png"></p>
<p>Here’s an example: In HSV/HSB, the <strong>H</strong>ue value of this bright blue <span>⬤</span> is 180°, the <strong>S</strong>aturation value is 67% and the <strong>L</strong>ightness value is 91%. You can also check the RGB values of your color: If at least two of the values are the same, they’re “pure”. For example, our <span>⬤</span> is a <code>rgb(77, 232, 232)</code>.</p>
<p>To make your colors look more natural and pleasing to the eyes of your readers, you can either tune down the saturation of pure colors or make them darker. <strong>If you want to have bright, saturated colors, rely on mixed colors</strong> that are at least 5-10° away from the pure colors.</p>
<p>In the image above, the red and orange, the blues and the greens have the same saturation and lightness. The only difference is the hue: The red <span>⬤</span> (0°), blue <span>⬤</span> (240°) and green <span>⬤</span> (120°) look more colorful than the orange <span>⬤</span> (40°), medium blue <span>⬤</span> (211°) and blue-ish green <span>⬤</span> (170°).</p>

<h4 id="Avoid-bright-saturated-colors">Avoid bright, saturated colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors4.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors4.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors4.png"></p>
<p>Neon colors will definitely attract the attention of readers. But these readers won’t thank you. Most of us get a bit stressed out when we see them: “Highly saturated, light colors will NOT be appropriate [to communicate] Serious or Trust, or Calm,” as Bartram, Patra &amp; Stone explain in their paper “Affective Color in Visualization” from 2017 (<a href="https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/Affective%20Color%20CHI%202017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>If your colors come close to 100% saturation <strong>and</strong> 100% brightness, it’s likely your colors are too colorful. That’s definitely the case for pure colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</p>
<p>“But I’ve seen such crazy colors before, and they look good,” you might say, and refer to projects like these ones:</p>

<p>If you compare the colors from these examples with colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>, you see how they former ones are all less saturated or darker. A 100% saturated and 100% bright green <span>⬤</span> becomes less saturated in the New York Times <span>⬤</span>, and less saturated <em>and</em> darker in both the Bloomberg article <span>⬤</span> and the Pudding article <span>⬤</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="mcpu-emu--an-emulator-for-mcpu">mcpu-emu : an emulator for MCPU</h2>

<p>MCPU is a neat minimal 8-bit CPU (CPU design by Tim Boescke in 2001, cpldcpu@opencores.org) - see its <a href="https://opencores.org/projects/mcpu">opencores project file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cpldcpu/MCPU">GitHub repo</a>. It fits into 32 macrocells on a CPLD and can operate on 64 bytes of RAM.</p>

<p>Being a minimal CPU it supports only four 8-bit instructions, that consist of 2 bit opcode and 6 bit address/immediate field.</p>

<p>It has two registers - an 8-bit accumulator and 6-bit program counter. MCPU supports 64 bytes of RAM shared between program and data.</p>

<p>The instruction set is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>mnemonic</th>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>NOR</td>
      <td>00AAAAAA</td>
      <td>Acc = Acc NOR mem[AAAAAA]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ADD</td>
      <td>01AAAAAA</td>
      <td>Acc = Acc +  mem[AAAAAA], update carry</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>STA</td>
      <td>10AAAAAA</td>
      <td>mem[AAAAAA] = Acc</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JCC</td>
      <td>11AAAAAA</td>
      <td>PC = AAAAAA if carry = 0, clear carry</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I’ve also added an “OUT” instruction according to Jean-Claude Wippler’s <a href="https://jeelabs.org/2017/11/tfoc---a-minimal-computer/">TFoC - A minimal computer</a> article, with the opcode of 0xFF that prints the accumulator to the standard output.</p>

<h2 id="the-emulator">The emulator</h2>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>mcpu_state</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span> <span>mcpu_state</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the emulation loop dispatches to instruction handlers based on the first two bits of the opcode.</p>

<p>I decided to represent the state of the CPU with a bitfield structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//Acc = Acc NOR mem[AAAAAA]</span>

<p>One can optionally print out the currently executed instruction with a small disassembler:</p>

<h3 id="getting-some-test-programs">Getting some test programs</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://jeelabs.org/2017/11/tfoc---a-minimal-computer/">TFoC - A minimal computer</a> article comes with two code examples, with the code formatted as a hexdump</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3E 45 7F C2 C4 FA 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF 01
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I converted this to a binary file (easier to consume by the C emulator)  with a following bash script that replaces the newlines with spaces, then gets rid of double spaces left by \r\n conversion and finally uses <code>xxd</code> to perform a “reverse hexdump”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/!bin/bash</span>
<span>cat</span> <span>$1</span> | <span>tr</span> <span>'\r\n'</span> <span>' '</span>  | <span>sed</span> <span>-e</span> <span>'s/[[:blank:]]\+/ /g'</span> | xxd <span>-r</span> <span>-p</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a disassembler and tweaking the output a bit  yields the following code</p>

<div><div><pre><code> <span>0</span><span>:</span>     <span>3</span><span>E</span>      <span>NOR</span> <span>$</span><span>3</span><span>E</span>    <span>; acc = 0    (from address 3E)</span>
 <span>1</span><span>:</span>     <span>45</span>      <span>ADD</span> <span>$</span> <span>5</span>    <span>; acc += 250 (from address 5)</span>
 <span>2</span><span>:</span>     <span>7</span><span>F</span>      <span>ADD</span> <span>$</span><span>3</span><span>F</span>    <span>; acc += 1   (from address 3F)</span>
 <span>3</span><span>:</span>     <span>C2</span>      <span>JCC</span> <span>$</span> <span>2</span>    <span>; if carry occurred, jump to line 2</span>
 <span>4</span><span>:</span>     <span>C4</span>      <span>JCC</span> <span>$</span> <span>4</span>    <span>; endless loop, jump to itself</span>
 <span>5</span><span>:</span>     <span>FA</span>      <span>-------</span>    <span>; literal 250</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>3</span><span>E</span><span>:</span>     <span>FF</span>      <span>-------</span>    <span>; literal 255</span>
<span>3</span><span>F</span><span>:</span>      <span>1</span>      <span>-------</span>    <span>; literal 1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that there are no immediate values, one can only work with what’s already in the memory, hence the literals 1, 250 and 255 need to exist somewhere within the RAM.</p>

<p>Stepping through the program shows it behaves as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>NOR $3E [FF]          A:00 C:0 PC:01
ADD $05 [FA]          A:FA C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FB C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FB C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FC C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FC C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FD C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FD C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FE C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FE C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FF C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FF C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:00 C:1 PC:03
JCC $02               A:00 C:0 PC:04
JCC $04               A:00 C:0 PC:04
JCC $04               A:00 C:0 PC:04
.. [JCC $04 repeats in an endless loop]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seemed it would be a useful thing to add a simple infinite loop detection - if the JCC instruction is jumping to its own address, there is no escape from this state as it won’t change the carry flag.</p>

<p>A second example - printing out prime numbers that fit into 8-bit number (up to 251) is more complex. It also required adding the special output opcode as mentioned earlier to see the results.</p>

<h3 id="porting-to-a-potato-microcontroller">Porting to a <del>potato</del> microcontroller</h3>

<p>What’s the best way to appreciate an emulator for a minimal chip published almost 20 years ago? Porting and running it on the smallest CPU I have at home - an ATTiny85 chip, which has 512 bytes of RAM and runs at 16 MHz in the form of the <a href="http://digistump.com/products/1">Digispark USB development board</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/mcpu-digistump.jpg" alt="digistump"></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: The dev board sitting on top of the MCPU paper</em></p>

<p>There are two things that won’t work straightforward - there’s no filesystem to read the RAM/ROM binary from and  and there’s also no standard output.</p>

<h4 id="loading-the-binaries">Loading the binaries</h4>

<p>We can solve the first problem by including the emulated image to the source as a C array, <code>hexdump</code> can help producing the 0x-encoded bytes we need from the binary file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>hexdump <span>-ve</span> <span>'1/1 "0x%.2x,"'</span> prog_test.bin
0x3e,0x45,0x7f,0xc2,0xc4,...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way we can directly use a byte array as the ROM/RAM image.</p>

<h4 id="output">Output</h4>

<p>We can solve the second problem by exploiting the fact that the DigiStump with ATTiny85 can act as an USB keyboard - so we just let it type out the output to the text editor of our choice.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//using this instead of printf() or Serial.print()</span>
<span>DigiKeyboard</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"NOR"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A 3-second delay after initializing the board helped get me ready to switch to a different text editor to capture the output instead of overwriting the source code :).</p>

<h4 id="code-golfing-to-trim-the-binary-size">Code golfing to trim the binary size</h4>

<p>The code also required some golfing as the maximum binary size for my ATTiny board is 6 kb. The tricks I used to slim down the compiled version included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inlining some functions</li>
  <li>simplifying the disassembler</li>
  <li>loading only the non-zero part of the binary</li>
</ul>

<p>Slimming the disassembler down:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>mnemonics</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"N"</span><span>,</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span><span>"S"</span><span>,</span><span>"J"</span><span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>disassemble</span><span>(</span><span>mcpu_state</span><span>*</span> <span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uint8_t</span> <span>opcode</span> <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>memory</span><span>[</span><span>state</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pc</span><span>];</span>
  <span>uint8_t</span> <span>immediate</span> <span>=</span> <span>opcode</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x3f</span><span>;</span>
  <span>sprintf</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>"%s $%02X [%02X]"</span><span>,</span> <span>mnemonics</span><span>[</span><span>opcode</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>6</span><span>],</span> <span>immediate</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>memory</span><span>[</span><span>immediate</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="random-code-golfing-tidbits">Random code golfing tidbits:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Printing the newline as a part of string and using <code>DigiKeyboard.print</code> instead of <code>DigiKeyboard.println</code> saves 14 bytes</li>
  <li>using <code>#define</code> instead of variables saves bytes</li>
  <li>replacing <code>sprintf()</code> with a series of <code>DigiKeyboard.print</code> calls saved 1.4 kb of the binary size!</li>
  <li>replacing <code>sprinf()</code></li>
  <li>loading the binary as a sequence of <code>state-&gt;memory[0] = 0x3e;</code> calls is shorter than initializing an array, and copying to CPU memory by a for loop in case of short binaries (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>That meant I had enough space to add blinking a LED and making a “tick” sound on a buzzer on every clock cycle! 
I ended up with a final binary size of <strong>4498 bytes</strong> for the prime-calculating binary with just the number as the output and <strong>4858 bytes</strong> with disassembler and status information in.</p>

<p>It’s also painfully slow - the delay between the first few and the last prime numbers is noticeable and it takes around 300 ms to calculate and print the very last primes (up to 255).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>P</span>eople afflicted by Covid-19, particularly those with bad cases, experience difficulty breathing.&nbsp; We need oxygen in our tissues to keep our bodies working and our brains clear; viral damage to our lungs deprives bodies of this vital dissolved gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>	This oxygen-starved condition is called hypoxia, and itâ€™s also a serious condition in many parts of the worldâ€™s ocean, as well as in estuaries, lagoons, rivers, and lakes. Marine hypoxia receives much less public attention than ocean acidification or warming—but in many parts of the world its effects may be just as profound, and the problem is worsening.</p>
<p>	The causes of marine hypoxia are twofold. The first, which has been studied the most, is the too-much-of-a-good-thing problem of nutrient over-enrichment. Vast loads of nutrients are applied to farm fields as fertilizers, spill from our sewage and septic systems, and waft from the tailpipes of automobiles. Inevitably some of these make their way into water, stimulating blooms of tiny plankton that eventually die and decay.&nbsp;The process of decaying consumes the oxygen, and hypoxia ensues. Wastewater treatment plants have helped but are not enough. Some nutrient-loaded hypoxic waters are now-infamous â€œdead zones,â€� such as the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie most summers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The other major cause is global warming.&nbsp;Warmer water canâ€™t hold as much dissolved oxygen as colder water. Itâ€™s lighter, too, and therefore tends to float above cooler layers, cutting them off from atmospheric exchange so that they eventually become deoxygenated as well. This phenomenon isnâ€™t directly associated with nutrient over-enrichment, but can exacerbate and intensify dead zones and impact deep ocean waters that have few nutrients. Warming is a global problem affecting the oxygen status of all waters—and it also fuels blooms of algae that die and decay, again setting off the cycle of oxygen loss.</p>
<p>	The general public—and even many scientists—are unaware of the rapidly expanding scale of deoxygenation. Among the first researchers to describe it were marine ecologists Bob Diaz and Rutger Rosenberg, who in the 1980s began to study the impacts on bottom-dwelling organisms in estuaries and coastal seas. In 1995 they wrote, "There is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period as dissolved oxygen." &nbsp;</p>
<p>	In 2008, Diaz and Rosenberg published a landmark study in the journal <em>Science</em>, documenting over 400 such zones and showing that their growth was exponential.&nbsp;By 2019 their tally exceeded 700, and possibly as many as 1000, coastal dead zones.&nbsp;If we make a chart of the known history of increase and color-code it by Gross World Product, an index of global economic output, we can appreciate the linkage of these dead zones to human activity:</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_423219c2026b77bfba722aa122b966a6.jpg" alt="dead zones and GWP chart"><figcaption><span>Growth in the number of coastal marine ecosystems classified as â€œdead zonesâ€� by Diaz and Rosenberg (2008) and Diaz et al. (2019).  The colors indicate levels of Gross World Product (GWP), and show that as economic output has increased exponentially, so has the number of polluted, deoxygenated dead zones. </span><br><span>GWP data: World Bank and CIA Factbook (compiled in Wikipedia).</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation in open oceans, away from coasts, extends farther and deeper, and is largely caused by the aforementioned tendency of warm water to seal off the cool waters below. The extent and spread of these so-called oxygen minimum zones wasnâ€™t fully appreciated until around 15 years ago, when improved instrumentation allowed scientists to measure them.&nbsp;Ten years ago their total area was estimated at 8 percent of Earth's ocean surface area—11.7 million square miles altogether, an area larger than North America and comparable in size to the entire African continent. That area is expanding today.<br></p>
<p>Brief periods of hypoxia—or even no oxygen, a phenomenon called anoxia—are common in nature and many organisms adapt by moving away or going temporarily dormant.&nbsp;A very few species are exceptionally tolerant and even have specialized metabolic pathways to cope in these circumstances.&nbsp;As the scale of deoxygenation increases, however, we see low-oxygen events so large and long that even highly mobile organisms, like fish, canâ€™t always escape.&nbsp;Some may be able to survive but become so weak that they have difficulty moving and finding food, let alone digesting it.&nbsp;Think of the Covid-19 sufferers who are so exhausted from lack of oxygen that they can barely move.&nbsp;Itâ€™s the same basic issue.&nbsp;As scientists study the problem of marine deoxygenation, we are increasingly seeing the effects on everything from fish growth to reproductive impairment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although most of the studies on biotic effects of deoxygenation have taken place in laboratories, my colleague Ben Walther and I, together with our students and colleagues, have learned to decipher signs of hypoxia exposure that are â€œrecordedâ€� in tiny bones within fish heads, called otoliths or ear-stones.&nbsp;These calcium carbonate deposits grow incrementally and take up various trace elements including the element manganese, which becomes available only at very low oxygen concentrations.&nbsp;By studying the lifetime uptake of manganese, biologist Michele Casini and I showed that periods of intense hypoxia have profound impacts on the growth and health of Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea. With less oxygen available, cod have less energy for foraging and fighting off parasites and infections. As a result, they are unhealthy and shrunken compared to cod living in better environments. By age three, cod with high levels of hypoxia exposure are one-third smaller than healthy cod from oxygen-rich waters. Multiply that by population size and you have an epic loss of biomass. This has direct economic consequences and likely causes enormous suffering for the fish themselves.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_15b7f377d5e469878f05995df3610167.jpg" alt="Cod before-and-after"><figcaption><span>Left: Cod caught in 1981 off the island of Gotland, Sweden. Right: Cod caught in 2020 in the same vicinity. Baltic cod today are affected by several stressors, foremost among them hypoxia. </span><br><span>K. Limburg and Y. Heimbrand</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation impacts ripple through entire ecosystems, too.&nbsp;Recent work has shown that in large stretches of the ocean even zooplankton, the microscopic animals who feed fish, often live on the edge of metabolic collapse. A study in the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone found that zooplankton there migrate in and out of microhabitats with extremely low oxygen; they are among the most hypoxia-tolerant organisms, yet are already at their metabolic limits. Projected further declines in oxygen may put them over the edge, with important consequences for carbon cycling and other biogeochemical processes in the open ocean.&nbsp;Food webs become compromised, particularly those on sea bottoms; there are many documented cases of sensitive invertebrate communities falling victim to hypoxic events since they cannot flee. Hypoxia has even been found to cause mass mortality in coral reef ecosystems, and in some instances may play as important a role as the better-known culprit of elevated water temperatures. Even open-water ecosystems change as the volume of healthy habitat shrinks and species crowd together, leading to novel food-web interactions. Covid-19â€™s web of long-term complications presents an uncanny parallel.<br></p>
<p>	Fortunately for humanity, a vaccine for Covid-19 should be available in 2021.&nbsp;The outlook for the oceans is not so optimistic, but neither is it hopeless.&nbsp;Think about the initial response to the virus, which was hamstrung by shortages of necessary medical supplies and technology, including masks and respirators; once the issues were recognized, it became possible to prioritize production to deal with the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of coastal hypoxia, nutrient pollution reductions coupled with wetland and seagrass restoration are akin to masks and respirators. They help protect the ecosystems and build up their resiliency. Those approaches resulted in greatly improved water quality and subsequent return of biodiversity in the waters off Tampa Bay, Florida, for example. And after decades of nutrient management, some parts of the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay are beginning to show signs of recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The looming, elephant-in-the-room challenge is to deal with global warming, which will require new economic policies at national and global scales and the commitment of governments and citizens everywhere. Although overshadowed in the news cycle by Covid-19, global warming is still on the rise, fueled by human outputs of greenhouse gases.&nbsp;We <em>must</em> bend the curve on greenhouse gas emissions, just as we must flatten the Covid-19 curve. Without such change, we are headed in a dark, scary direction where nobody really wants to go.</p>

  <p>I had been a happy-go Java developer on Windows platform. And then I had to ride the Ruby-on-Rails wave over Linux platform, only to realize how much I didn't know about productivity with automation. Later I moved onto MacOS to experience bliss before starting to hate it for one thing after the other; right from their buggy operating system upgrades to Apple not providing power cable compatible to Indian market resulting in earthing issues. Out of frustration I jumped back to Ubuntu and now back on Windows after long years.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting onto Windows was more out of necessity than interest and I started to explore how much things have changed in the Windows world. It wasn't a smooth return for me but the teething period is over and I'm loving Windows again. If you are onto Windows 10 Pro edition, and wanting to get the best of both worlds (Windows and Linux), this post is for you. I am jotting down ProTips to experience delight and productivity at development work.</p>
<ol><li>Use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1, for the former is far less resource intensive by integrating natively with Windows 10 Hyper-V virtualization stack, and thus phenomenally faster too. If you are on Windows 10 Home edition, you need to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro edition and it is worth it, for you can get it at half the price upon upgrade.</li><li>Do not mount windows native formatted drive (NTFS) onto WSL for code that can be developed both in WSL environment and Windows. While this works, it is snail paced and you will frustrated too soon. I tried this out of curiosity and frustrated beyond my anticipation. If you are still wanting this, you will have to first format the storage drive in DOS format (as FAT32), so that it works well with your WSL and host Windows operating systems. This is possible the best middle-ground that you can hit upon.</li><li>Use <a href="https://aka.ms/terminal" target="_blank">Windows Terminal</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.codonomics.com/2020/09/Cmder" target="_blank">Cmder</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty" target="_blank">Mintty</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> or any other console emulators. Why? You can customize it with default settings for each of WSLs, Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or other terminals integrated with it. Also Windows Terminal is lightweight and faster.</li><li>When you start your development server in WSL 2, try testing it in your browser with <b><i>localhost</i></b>, it won't work. WSL is one proper sandboxed environment or VM. You need to port forward localhost settings for this to work. This can be done by adding the line like below in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file in your windows <b><i>$HOME</i></b> directory.<br>--
 --<br>
 </li><li>WSL 2 can consume all of your host memory. You can set limits to it by appending the line&nbsp;<b><i>memory=16GB</i></b> in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file.</li><li>Do install <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" target="_blank">Oh-My-ZSH</a> to use zsh shell instead of the default bash. You get bunch of goodies like pre-configured aliases for Git and more by way of its plugins that you can configure to your preference.</li><li>If you are into using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank">tmux</a>, you can use that too in your WSL 2, and power it up with <a href="https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline" target="_blank">tmux-powerline</a>.</li><li>You can change the location of your WSL 2 distribution's virtual hard drive.&nbsp;I keep all of my VMs (and now WSL 2 virtual hard drives) in <b><i>D:\VMs\&lt;platform&gt;\&lt;distribution name&gt;</i></b>. Run the following commands in PowerShell - replacing distribution name and preferred location: <br>----<br> Also at the time of writing, when you import a distribution, you may need to tell WSL 2 to start the distribution using the Linux user account you created when you first created the distribution. Thanks to <a href="https://www.58bits.com/blog/2020/05/30/wsl-2-setup-development">58bits.com </a> that you can run the below PowerShell script that imports the distribution, and resets the default user as you would like it to be. <br>-- --<br> Note that if your import fails with 'Unspecified error' (or other) - you may need to limit the amount of memory allocated to <b><i>vmmem</i></b>. You can do this with WSL2 config to limit memory as mentioned in ProTip 5 above.</li><li>If you are into using VS-Code as your IDE for development, you can launch the one you installed on your host Windows 10 OS from WSL 2 bash in your project's root folder and executing <b><i>`code .`</i></b>. With this you can work on your windows operating system launching your development servers in WSL environment, thus getting the best of both the worlds. Additionally, you can install your vs-code extensions on remote wsl as well as on host OS, all from within your IDE.</li><li>And <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> works well with your WSL2 too. You just can extract the best from everything.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Windows 10 is super cool again with WSL 2. Whether you are a Windows buff wanting to leverage Linux goodies, or a Linux buff wanting to draw upon Windows 10 strengths, you can have it all. Happy coding!!..

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span lang="EN-AU">IBM made some announcements today relating to
their latest POWER7 server offerings. The new line of systems includes new
entry level systems and the highly anticipated high-end system, the POWER7 <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&amp;infotype=an&amp;appname=iSource&amp;supplier=897&amp;letternum=ENUS110-158">795</a>!
<span></span>They also officially outlined some of
the new features available in AIX 7.1. You can review the details <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/cgi-bin/common/ssi/ssialias?infotype=an&amp;subtype=ca&amp;htmlfid=897/ENUS210-200&amp;appname=isource&amp;language=enus">here</a>.
Ive discussed some of these new features </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/aix_7_open_beta_is_live_it_s_time_to_test?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
and </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/creating_an_aix_5_2_wpar_on_aix_7?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
The official AIX 7.1 announcement details are available </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/news/announcement/20100817_annc.html"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The announcement got me thinking about my
recent customer engagements and why some have chosen to deploy AIX into their
IBM POWER environments, while others are considering a Linux on POWER solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Ive found that it usually comes down to a
skills decision more than anything else. Most customers are happy to either
continue working with AIX (if they are existing AIX users) or migrate from
another UNIX OS to AIX. Ive seen very few customers actually migrate to Linux
on POWER, but Ive worked with several that have seriously considered it. Those
that have chosen to deploy Linux are doing so purely because they have in-house
Linux skills. They are concerned that migrating to AIX may be too big a jump
for their technical staff. I find this thinking interesting, as most of the
customers Ive dealt with who run other UNIX OSs like Tru64, Solaris or HP-UX
are more than happy to migrate to AIX. They believe the move is relatively
minor and doesnt require massive re-training of their UNIX admins. I tend to
agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For me, <b>AIX</b>
is my preferred Enterprise class UNIX Operating System. Notice Im prefacing
this with the words <b><i>Enterprise class</i></b>. Dont get me wrong, I have worked with Linux
systems in both small and large customer environments. It is a great OS. But
Ive found that it really only fits into environments that have a relatively
small number of users and where significant downtime can be tolerated for
things like operating system maintenance. This doesnt fit the Enterprise class
of UNIX server OSs that Im thinking of here. When I contemplate the word <i>Enterprise</i>, I think of servers and
operating systems that can respond to business demands in terms of performance,
reliability, stability and availability. An Enterprise UNIX can provide all of
these things without compromise. Linux can offer performance and reliability
(in my opinion). However, from what Ive seen, it lacks features &amp; functions
in the areas of stability and availability. AIX on the other hand ticks all the
boxes. Again, this is just my opinion based on my experiences with both AIX and
Linux in the Enterprise landscape. Others will no doubt have their own
experiences that may or may not match my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">So when Im designing an Enterprise UNIX
server environment for a customer, I always start with an AIX on POWER base. If
the customer wants Linux, sure I can look at that too, but I strongly recommend
AIX as my preferred choice for large systems. Most of my customers are running
relatively large SAP/Oracle systems. AIX on POWER is a great combination for
large Enterprise systems. If you need to deploy large database systems that
must service tens of thousands of users (like a big SAP system), then I believe
AIX is the perfect OS on which to provide a platform for these large scale
systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX is a very mature and powerful UNIX OS. It
has been a major player in the UNIX server market for over 20 years (as shown
below). Some people are just not aware of how mature, robust and stable the AIX
OS has become over the years. There are many impressive aspects of the OS in
the areas of performance, scalability, reliability, management and
administration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p></o:p></span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif"></a> </p>





<p><span lang="EN-AU">Just looking at some of the administration
capabilities built into AIX are enough for me to always recommend AIX over
Linux (or any other UNIX OS), when it comes to large Enterprise servers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For example, the System Management Interface Tool (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-smit/index.html"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">) can make the UNIX admins life a lot simpler.
This is an interactive tool that is part of the AIX OS. Almost all tasks that
an AIX administrator may need to perform can be executed using this tool. It is
a text-based tool (there is also an X interface but I recommend sticking with
the text-based menus). Everything it does, it does through standard AIX
commands and Korn shell functions. This feature is especially useful when you
need to automate a repetitive task; you can have SMIT create the proper
command-line sequence, and you can then use those commands in your own script.
My compatriot, Anthony English, has a nice intro to </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/AIXDownUnder/entry/smitty_to_his_friends20?lang=en"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> on his AIX blog. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The
<b>AIX Logical Volume Manager</b> (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0106.pdf"><span>LVM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">)
is built into the OS, for free. AIX LVM helps UNIX system administrators </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aixstorage/index.html"><span>manage their
storage</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> in a very flexible manner. LVM allows logical
volumes to span multiple physical volumes. Data on logical volumes appears to
be contiguous to the user, but might not be contiguous on the physical volume.
This allows file systems, paging space, and other logical volumes to be resized
or relocated, span multiple physical volumes, and have their contents
replicated for greater flexibility and availability. It provides capabilities
for mirroring data across disks, migrating data across disks &amp; storage
subsystems, expand/shrink filesystems and more.......all of which can be
performed dynamically.....<b>no downtime</b>
required. The concept, implementation and interface to the AIX LVM is one of a
kind. All of its features support the continuous availability philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">One of the biggest reasons that I love AIX
over Linux is the <b>mksysb</b>. Its built
into the OS and allows you to create a bootable image of your AIX system. This
image can be used to restore a broken AIX system or for cloning other systems.
The cloning feature is truly amazing. You can take an image created on a
low-end system and deploy it on any POWER system, all the way up to the
high-end POWER boxes. This simplifies the installation and cloning processing
when you need to install and manage many AIX LPARs. By using an SOE mksysb
image you can deploy consistent AIX images across your Enterprise POWER server
environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">This brings me to another wonderful feature of
AIX, the <b>Network Installation Manager</b>
(</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247296.html?Open"><span>NIM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">).
NIM is powerful network installation tool (comparable to Linux Kickstart).
Using NIM you can backup/restore, update and upgrade one or more AIX systems
either individually or simultaneously. This can all be achieved over a network
connection, removing the need for handling physical installation media forever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Another fine example of AIXs superior OS management tools is </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/aix/aprilmay08/tipstechniques/20226p1.aspx"><span>multibos</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">. This tool allows an AIX administrator to
create and maintain two separate, bootable instances of the AIX OS within the
same root volume group (rootvg). This second instance of rootvg is known as a
standby Base Operating System (BOS) and is an extremely handy tool for
performing AIX TL and Service Pack (SP) updates. Multibos lets you install,
update and customize a standby instance of the AIX OS <b>without impacting</b> the running and active production instance of the
AIX OS. This is valuable in environments with tight maintenance windows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">When it comes to upgrading the OS to a new
release of AIX, the </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-migrate_nimadm/index.html"><span>nimadm</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
utility can assist the administrator greatly in this task. </span><span lang="EN-AU">The <b><span>nimadm</span></b>
utility offers several advantages. For example, a system administrator can use <b><span>nimadm</span></b> to create a copy of a
NIM client's rootvg and migrate the disk to a newer version or release of AIX.
All of this can be done <b>without
disruption</b> to the client (there is no outage required to perform the
migration). After the migration is finished, the only downtime required will be
a single scheduled reboot of the system.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX
6.1 introduced new capability that most UNIX operating systems are still
working on. </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&amp;context=SG11G&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=isg3T1012104&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=utf-8&amp;lang=#concurrent"><span>Concurrent
Updates of the AIX Kernel</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.....<b>without a reboot</b>! IBM is always working hard at making AIX an OS
that can provide <b>continuous availability</b>,
even if it needs to be patched. AIX now has the ability to update certain kernel
components and kernel extensions in place, without needing a system reboot. In
addition, concurrent updates can be removed from the system without needing a
reboot. Can you do this with other UNIX OSs? <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And thats just some of the features that make
AIX <b>the</b> only UNIX OS that I recommend
for Enterprise systems. There are many more tools and features that I couldnt
live without (like alt_disk_install, savevg, installp, WPARs, etc, the list
goes on). If you are new to AIX and you are considering what your next UNIX OS
should be, then I recommend you take a <b>very</b>
close look at </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://ibm.com/aix"><span>AIX</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And finally, the support provided by IBM, is
first class. Whenever Ive needed assistance with an AIX issue or query, I have
always received timely, professional and useful advice. On the rare occasions
where Ive uncovered a new bug, IBM AIX support have always been quick to
provide me with an interim fix to resolve or workaround a problem. Thats the
sort of support youd expect for an Enterprise UNIX OS, isnt it? Whats the
support like from your current UNIX (or Linux) OS vendor?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Linux is still a viable UNIX operating system.
However, I think its more suited to certain workloads like small to medium
size mail, web and other utility servers and services. AIX, however, would be
my platform of choice for my 10TB Oracle database running SAP ERP, not just for
performance reasons, but primarily because of the system administration
features of AIX that allow me to support and manage the system without
impacting my customers or enforcing reboots/outages whenever I need to change
something on the system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">All IBM need to do is create their own Linux
distribution (Blue Linux perhaps?)
that has all the features of AIX built in and then Im sold! But why would
they? We already have AIX.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's install OpenBSD on a Lenovo Thinkpad X270. I used this computer for my
computer science studies. It has both Arch Linux and Windows 10 installed as
dual boot. Now that I'm no longer required to run Windows, I can ditch the dual
boot and install an operating system of my choice.</p>

<p>First, I grab my work Thinkpad running Arch Linux and some USB dongle big enough
for the <a href="https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/miniroot67.fs">amd64 miniroot
image</a> (roughly
five megabytes, that is). This small image does not include the file sets, which
will be downloaded during installation instead. I also download the <a href="https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/SHA256">SHA256
checksums</a> from the
Swiss mirror, and verify the downloaded image, before I copy it on my dongle:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256 
miniroot67.fs: OK
$ sudo dd if=miniroot67.fs of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>The Thinkpad X270 is connected to my network through Ethernet. The WiFi firmware
usually needs to be installed separately, so only Ethernet will work out of the
box. The BIOS has UEFI activated. OpenBSD and UEFI has issues on older hardware
(at least on a 2014 Dell laptop I have), but let's try it on this laptop,
anyway.</p>
<p>I plug in the dongle prepared before, and start the computer. I interrupt
the regular boot with Enter and pick an alternative boot method by pressing F12.
Now I pick my USB dongle. After roughly a minute, the installer has been
started. Now I follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I choose the option <code>I</code> to install OpenBSD.</li>
<li>For the keyboard layout, I pick <code>sg</code>, for Swiss German.</li>
<li>As a hostname, I simply pick <code>x270</code>, because it's a Thinkpad X270, and I'm not
  very creative when it comes to naming things.</li>
<li>From the available network options (<code>iwm0</code>: WiFi, <code>em0</code>: Ethernet, and
  <code>vlan0</code>: Virtual LAN), I pick <code>em0</code>.</li>
<li>I try to get an IPv4 address over DHCP, which seems to work very quickly.</li>
<li>Next, I type in my very secret root password twice.</li>
<li>I do <em>not</em> start <code>sshd</code> by default, because I don't need to connect to this
  machine through SSH. It's supposed to be a workstation, not a server.</li>
<li>The X Window System should not be started by <code>xnodm(1)</code>, so I leave it to
  <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Neither do I want to change the default to <code>com0</code>.</li>
<li>I set up my user <code>patrick</code> with my proper name <code>Patrick Bucher</code>, and a decent
  password.</li>
<li>The time zone has been detected properly as <code>Europe/Zurich</code>, which I just
  leave the way it is.</li>
<li>The installer detected two disks: <code>sd0</code> and <code>sd1</code>. Since <code>sd0</code> is the detected
  SSD in my laptop, the UEFI issue from my Dell laptop doesn't exist on this
  computer. I pick <code>sd0</code> for the root disk, since <code>sd1</code> is my USB dongle.</li>
<li>I choose to use the whole disk with a GPT partitioning schema, because it's
  2020.</li>
<li>An auto-allocated layout for <code>sd0</code> is presented. It looks decent to me, so I
  just go with that auto layout.</li>
<li>I don't want to initialize another disk, so I just press Enter (<code>done</code>).</li>
<li>Since the miniroot image does not come with the file sets, I pick <code>http</code> as
  the location for the sets.</li>
<li>I don't use a proxy, and use the mirror <code>mirrog.ungleich.ch</code> and the server
  directory <code>pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code> as proposed.</li>
<li>Next, I unselect the game sets by entering <code>-game*</code>. (I heard that they're not
  much fun to play.) I leave all the other sets activated, including the <code>x</code>
  sets, which will be required for the GUI later on.</li>
<li>After those sets are installed, I press Enter (<code>done</code>). Now the installer
  performs various tasks, after which I choose to <code>halt</code> the computer. This
  gives me time to remove the USB dongle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I now restart my laptop, and OpenBSD boots. This takes more time than booting
Arch Linux, which uses <code>systemd</code>, whereas OpenBSD uses <code>rc</code>, which performs the
startup tasks sequentially.</p>
<p>There's a message showing up that various firmware (<code>intel-firmware</code>,
<code>iwm-firmware</code>, <code>inteldrm-firmware</code>, <code>uvideo-firmware</code>, and <code>vmm-firmware</code>) has
been installed automatically. Very nice, indeed.</p>
<h2>WiFi Connection</h2>
<p>Now that the <code>iwm-firmware</code> has been installed, I can connect right away to my
WiFi network <code>frzbxpdb5</code>. I create a file called <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>, wich
<code>hostname</code> being a literal string, and <code>iwm0</code> being the WiFi network card. The
connection to my WiFi network consists of a single line:</p>
<pre><code>dhcp nwid frzbxpdb5 wpakey [my-wpakey]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>frzbxpdb5</code> is my WiFi network's ESSID, and <code>[my-wpakey]</code> needs to be
replaced by the actual WPA key.</p>
<p>Then the networking can be restarted for that device:</p>
<pre><code># sh /etc/netstart iwm0
</code></pre>
<p>This script is kind enough to set the file permissions of <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>
to <code>640</code>, and then connects to my WiFi network.</p>
<p>I unplug the Ethernet cable and <code>ping openbsd.org</code>, which works fine, even after
a restart.</p>

<p>My GUI on Unix-like systems is based on the Dynamic Window Manager (<code>dwm</code>) and a
couple of other tools, such as <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, <code>slstatus</code>, <code>slock</code>, all created and
maintained by the <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a> community.</p>
<p>This software doesn't come with configuration facilities, but needs to be
configured in the respective C header file <code>config.h</code>, and then re-compiled.
Even though OpenBSD offers <code>dwm</code> as a package, customizing and configuring that
window manager requires to build it from source.</p>
<h2>Building <code>dwm</code> and Friends</h2>
<p>First, I need to install <code>git</code> to fetch the source code:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add git
</code></pre>
<p>Then I fetch the source code for <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, and <code>slstatus</code> from <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/slstatus
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dwm</code></h3>
<p>Next, I try to build <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd dwm
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This fails with an error message (<code>'ft2build.h' file not found</code>), which reminds
me of building <code>dwm</code> on FreeBSD roughly a month before. Since I can finde the
header file at another location:</p>
<pre><code># find / -type f -name ft2build.h
/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2/ft2build.h
</code></pre>
<p>I simply can modify the <code>config.mk</code> accordingly by changing</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = $(X11INC}/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, I only need to comment the above line, and uncomment the line below</p>
<pre><code># OpenBSD (uncomment)
</code></pre>
<p>The Suckless folks obviously are friendly towards OpenBSD, which is also
noticable in other places (more evidence to be shown further below).</p>
<p>The next compilation attempt succeeds:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>So let's install <code>dwm</code>, too:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<p>By default, and as to be seen in <code>config.h</code>, the keyboard combination
<code>[Alt]+[Shift]+[Enter]</code> (deeply engraved into the muscle memories of many <code>dwm</code>
users) starts the <code>st</code> terminal. This will be built in a while. However, I
prefer to use the <em>Super</em> or <em>Windows</em> key instead of <code>Alt</code>, since the former
is of no use in OpenBSD, and the latter still comes in handy when working with
the emacs readline mode. Therefore, I change the <code>MODKEY</code> from</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod1Mask
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod4Mask
</code></pre>
<p>Then I rebuild and reinstall <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>st</code></h3>
<p>Let's switch over to the <code>st</code> source directory and just try to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../st
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we get a warning that the function <code>pledge</code> (an OpenBSD mitigation, which
is built into the <code>master</code> branch, but surrounded by an <code>ifdef</code> preprocessor
statement, so that it will only be compiled for OpenBSD) is imported implicitly.
Let's just ignore this warning for now.</p>
<p>What's worse, the compilation fails with the error message:</p>
<pre><code>ld: error: unable to find library -lrt
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the FAQ comes in handy, stating that</p>
<pre><code>If you want to compile st for OpenBSD you have to remove -lrt from
config.mk, ...
</code></pre>
<p>Having done so in <code>config.mk</code>, <code>st</code> compiles without any further issues, and,
thus, can be rebuilt and installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dmenu</code></h3>
<p>Even OpenBSD users with Suckless tools have to open another GUI application than
a terminal emulator once in a while. For this purpose, Suckless offers <code>dmenu</code>.
Let's switch over to it and compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../dmenu
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we have the issue with <code>ft2build.h</code>, which can be resolved as above with
<code>dwm</code>: by using the proper path for <code>FREETYPEINC</code> in <code>config.mk</code>. Afterwards,
the build succeeds, and <code>dmenu</code> can be installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>slstatus</code></h3>
<p><code>dwm</code> has a status bar on the top right, which can be used to show various
information. I used to write some shell commands in <code>.xinitrc</code> to compose such a
status line, and then set it by <code>xset -b</code> once every five seconds or so. This
approach generates a multitude of processes every couple of seconds.</p>
<p><code>slstatus</code> is a C programm that is capable of showing various kinds of more or
less useful information. Let's switch over to <code>slstatus</code> and see, what is
available in <code>config.def.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../slstatus
$ less config.def.h
</code></pre>
<p>The comments section lists different functions (<code>battery_perc</code> for the battery
percentage, <code>datetime</code> for date and time information, <code>temp</code> for thermal
information, etc.). I usually display the CPU load, the battery percentage, the
memory usage, the current keyboard layout, and the current date and time.</p>
<p>Before configuring those, let's try to compile <code>slstatus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, so let's configure the information to be displayed in
<code>config.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    "%s",     "%F %T" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This renders the current date as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%F %T"
2020-09-05 19:26:38
</code></pre>
<p>I also like to have the weekday included, but not the seconds, so I define a
different argument string:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
Sat 2020-09-05 19:27
</code></pre>
<p>That's better, so let's use it in <code>config.h</code> (surrounded with some spaces in the
format string):</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    " %s ",   "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>The other settings I like to have do not require any arguments, at least not on
OpenBSD, so I only need to define a decent format string (with <code>|</code> as a
seperator) for those:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format           argument */
    { cpu_perc,     " cpu: %s%% |", NULL },
    { battery_perc, " bat: %s%% |", NULL },
    { ram_used,     " mem: %s |",   NULL },
    { keymap,       " %s |"         NULL },
    { datetime,     " %s ",         "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This actually compiles, so let's install it:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuring X Startup</h2>
<p>Now that all software is compiled and installed, let's run X. To do so, a file
<code>.xinitrc</code> in the user's directory is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Daniel J. Bernstein's IM2000 email proposal is not a good idea</h2>

	<p><small>September  6, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>A long time ago, Daniel J. Bernstein wrote a proposal for a new
generation of Internet email he called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a>, although it never went anywhere.
Ever since then, a significant number of people have idealized it
as the great white 'if only' hope of email (especially as the
solution to spam), in much the same way that people idealized Sun's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> as the great 'if only'
alternative to X11. Unfortunately, IM2000 is not actually a good
idea.</p>

<p>The core of <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a> is summarized by Bernstein as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>IM2000 is a project to design a new Internet mail infrastructure
around the following concept: Mail storage is the sender's
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first problem with this is that it doesn't remove the fundamental
problem of email, which is (depending on how you phrase it) that
email is an <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols"><em>anonymous push</em> protocol</a>
or that it lacks <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem"><em>revocable authorization</em> to send you things</a>. In IM2000, random strangers on the
Internet are still allowed to push to you, they just push less data
than they currently do with (E)SMTP mail.</p>

<p>The idea that IM2000 will deal with spam rests on the idea that
forcing senders to store mail is difficult for spammers. Even a
decade ago this was a questionable assumption, but today it is
clearly false. A great deal of serving capacity is yours for the
asking (and someone's credit card) in AWS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">GCP</a>, Azure, OVH,
and any number of other VPS and serverless computing places.  In
addition many spammers will have a relatively easy time with
'storing' their email, because their spam is already generated from
templates and so in IM2000 could be generated on the fly whenever
you asked for it from them. We now have a great deal of experience
with web servers that generate dynamic content on demand and it's
clear that they can run very efficiently and scale very well,
provided that they're designed competently.</p>

<p>(I wrote about this a long time ago <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageHelpsSpammers">here</a>, and things have gotten much
easier for spammers since then.)</p>

<p>At the same time, IM2000 is catastrophic for your email privacy.
People complain vociferously about 'tracking pixels' in HTML email
that betray when you open and read the email from someone; well,
IM2000 is one giant tracking pixel that reliably reports when and
where you read that email message. IM2000 would also be a terrible
email reading experience, because it's like a version of IMAP where
message retrieval has random delays and sometimes fails entirely.</p>

<p>(As far as spam filtering your incoming IM2000 messages goes, IM2000
gives you far less up front information than you currently get with
SMTP email. I wrote up this and other issues a long time ago in an
entry about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageProblems">the technical problems of such schemes</a>. Some of those problems are no longer
really an issue more than a decade later, but some continue to be.)</p>

<p>At a broader 'technical choices have social impacts' level, IM2000
would create a very different experience than today's email systems
if implemented faithfully, one where 'your' email was actually not
yours but was mostly other people's because other people are storing
it. Those other people can mostly retract individual messages by
deleting them from their servers (you would still have the basic
headers that are pushed to you), and they can wipe out large sections
of your email by deleting entire accounts (and the sent messages
associated with them), or even by going out of business or having
a data loss incident. Imagine a world where an ISP getting out of
the mail business means that all email that its customers have sent
from their ISP email accounts over the years just goes away, from
everyone's mailbox.</p>

<p>(If 'ISP' sounds abstract here, substitute 'Yahoo'. Or 'GMail'.)</p>

<p>In addition, in some potential realizations of IM2000, email would
become mutable in practice (even if you weren't supposed to in
theory), because once again the sender is storing the message and
is in a position to alter that stored copy. Expect that capability
to be used sooner or later, just as people silently revise things
posted on the web (including official statements, perhaps especially
including them).</p>

<p>Some of these social effects can be partially avoided by storing
your own local copies of IM2000 messages when you read them, but
there are two issues. The first is pragmatic; the more you store
your own copies and the earlier you make them, the more IM2000 is
SMTP in a bad disguise. The second is social; in the IM2000 world
the server holds the authoritative copy of the message, not you,
so if you say the message says one thing (based on your local copy)
and the server operator says it says something else (or doesn't
exist), the server operator likely wins unless you have very strong
evidence.</p>

<p>In general, I think that IM2000 or anything like it would create
an 'email' experience that was far more like the web, complete with
the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool messages changing</a>, than today's
email (where for better or worse you keep your own full record of
what you received, read and reread it at your leisure, and know
that it's as immutable as you want it to be). And it would still
have the problem that people can push stuff in front of you, unlike
the web where you usually at least have to go looking for things.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the pandemic hit global news, everyone (I presume) and especially on Twitter were sharing their predictions about the future.<br></p><p>Apart from the range of predictions from dark and gloomy to “it’s going to be alright soon” optimism, there was intense collective thought being shared on how to adjust to the new life.&nbsp;</p><p>A dangerous outside world with a potentially lethal virus, getting stuck indoors and hence being wrenched out of every routine and social habits, general anxiety and fear for yourself and your loved ones - didn’t stop people from sharing “if you don’t build your business ideas while you’re stuck indoors, you’ll never do it”. Or “this is the best time to become fit and the best version of yourself.”&nbsp;</p><p>You know, non-empathetic BS that treats human beings like a robot following a set of instructions.</p><p>I spent month 1 in anxiety and fear desperately trying to adjust to the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>By month 2, I’d figured out that to not go insane, I will have to block news, browsing Twitter, and any websites tracking the pandemic 12 times a day. And so I did. My mind felt wrinkled until I let go, and it felt like I could relax and breathe &nbsp;again.</p><p>In the same month, I thought I would adjust and “become the best version of myself” or whatever hustle porn phrase was trending that week. I failed at adjusting and living a “normal” life for several months. I stopped trying so hard.</p><p>It also dawned on me that while my problems are real, the people really facing a hard time are those from the lower economic strata. They don't just have an option to live indoors and "WFH". They can't quit their jobs and go home. I became grateful about my position and privilege in life and internally I stopped complaining to myself about how difficult life is during a pandemic. I became calm.</p><p>It’s month 7 and I think I finally got a grip on my life.</p><p>You see, building new routines and adjusting to new social normals is a long process. Sure, you can write it down on a piece of paper and try to follow it, but your body and mind aren’t fully aligned and adjusted.</p><p>In particular, I found being stuck within 4 walls and not talking to anyone other than my family members for months wasn't going to help me adjust to the new normal.</p><p>In June, I started writing. This was the first step towards normalcy as I finally got in touch with my thoughts again and found an outlet to express them.</p><p>And only in the last month, I created a routine around going downstairs for a long 45-min brisk walk (while wearing a mask and avoiding people like the plague). I also started scheduling a lot of calls whenever someone from my life reached out, just to catch up with them and behave like we would had we bumped into each other at a coffee shop.</p><p>Human beings are incredible at adapting to a situation and normalising it. Life is finally starting to feel normal again. It just takes time, in this case 7 &nbsp;months.</p><p>I can see this in other people too - their behaviours, their mood, what they are saying when you talk to them and what you see people talk about on Twitter and other social platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, I played <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=puertorico" target="_blank">Puerto Rico</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">Akash</a> in the afternoon. In the evening. I walked while listening and occasionally babbling with a group of people on <a href="https://leher.app/" target="_blank">Leher</a> (Clubhouse for India). It felt like a fun conversation we would have otherwise had over a beer had we met physically. At night, I joked and laughed around with college friends over a Zoom call. </p><p>Life felt normal.</p><p>While the pandemic is bigger than ever and it’s imperative that we continue following all safety guidelines, having a routine you follow everyday, going outdoors regularly, socialising with people on video or phone calls - helps me adjust to this life in a pandemic.</p></div></div>]]>

							<p>Fog clings to a never-ending row of low-rise buildings down the length of a dusty road, it’s early, around eight o’clock on a cool April morning. The fog clears and voices breakthrough and you see the first glimpses of the large bazaar, sounds of shutters slamming open, doors being unlocked and people greeting each other as their day starts. The occasional chatter of gunfire can be heard as firearms are test fired nearby.</p>
<p><em>Darra Adam Khel</em>. This bustling town is situated in modern-day <em>Pakistan</em>, a stone’s throw from the Pak-Afghan border. <em>What makes it so special?</em> You may ask and the answer lies within the myriad of myths and legends put out over the years.</p>

<p><span><iframe width="1160" height="653" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-f7j-RlN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As of this year, 2019, <em>Darra</em> is the last main tribal arms market and manufacturing town that remains in the Pak-Afghan FATA region (Federally-Administered Tribal Region – FATA pronounced Faa-Thaa locally), the last vestige of old-world freedom in the area. Over the last few years, the other manufacturing hubs and markets in towns like <em>Landi Kotal</em>, just a few minutes’ drive from <em>Torkham</em> border on the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, have finally died out leaving a handful of shops and a couple of gunsmiths who repair the large number of firearms still found across the region. <em>Peshawar’s</em> massive arms bazaars have also disappeared leaving a few licensed manufacturers in a small industrial estate on its outskirts and a few licensed dealers scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p><em>Darra</em> held out against the threat of the <em>Taliban</em> in the early 2010s, fighting them off on a number of occasions seeing as they had the arms, supplies and manpower to fend for themselves. They are no friend to these <em>Taliban</em> as you can see even though they have been linked by a few journalistic sources with selling them an enormous number of arms and ammunition. Contrary to popular belief that the market is now dead or not operating, the bazaar still thrives with many firearms bought and sold daily in its now-legendary bazaar. Yes, there were times were the shutters ere down but this was always just a façade, something that happened on the face and business continued in the back alleys and dusty basements.</p>
<p>However, the town of thousands of arms dealers and manufacturing workshops has been relegated to around a thousand of both due to the global war on terror and its impact on the global arms trade and international smuggling routes. They do not get as much as they used to though they still have a steady but small supply of items that get through to them even to this day. Due to this war on terror, the FATA area – which for many years managed to retain its autonomy, was regulated to prohibit the sale and ownership of explosive type ordnance and large-caliber arms such as HMG’s (e.g: DsHK / KPV) and up to the general population there. Fortunately, <em>Darra</em> still maintains its hold on the trade of tribal arms throughout the now regulated tribal areas and still holds a monopoly on arms manufactured there that are sold within <em>Pakistan</em> and <em>Afghanistan</em> too.</p>
<p>The war on terror has a lot of detriments with the main one being that it has increased the price of arms so much; that now an AK rifle which would have cost approximately Rs10,000 (~£55/~$67), around fifteen years ago, now costs a minimum of around ten times that. Yes, as with all markets, prices do fluctuate depending on many local and regional factors but prices still remain relatively high due to this. Genuine, original factory-made arms command a high premium on the market as a whole throughout the Pak-Afghan region and this has meant that locally made arms are sold more than originals due to the somewhat extortionate prices that can be seen. Due to soaring inflation and prices of raw material, locally made arms now cost the same as originals were only a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>Some older background information would be needed to understand why such a place even exists on such a scale as it is or even was. During the British Raj period of the 1800s where the British Empire ruled over these tribal areas, small workshops opened up in many areas across the region to produce exact copies of arms used by the British to fight back against them. Gunsmiths started with muskets and then progressed onto Lee-Enfield action rifles and that was their mainstay for a lengthy period continuing to upgrade and produce newer variations, turning those small shops into larger ones. That is how <em>Darra</em> and many other manufacturing towns and bazaars got their start and from then, the markets grew and grew becoming what they then were known as. <em>Darra’s</em> second major call to fame was that it supplied arms and ammunition to the <em>Mujahideen</em> in <em>Afghanistan</em> during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan War, some say it was even supported by the federal government too at this point. More recently, <em>Darra’s</em> notoriety came to surface as ill-informed people conducting poor journalism claimed it was a black market and that the gunsmiths manufactured guns in mud huts, with basic tools using their bare hands. Putting this to rest, let me start with calling it a black market; this is incorrect as the areas where these markets were/are based comes under its own tribal laws and governance much different to the rest of <em>Pakistan</em>, they are operating well within their own laws therefore it is not a black market in any sense within these borders. There is an element of truth to the thought of mud huts, bare hands and rudimentary methods but the times long past, when this was the norm, are not an indication of how things are in this day and age. Yes, some processes such as heat-treating and finishing are done in so-called mud huts and outdoors under makeshifts structures (this is much needed for ventilation) however the actual workshops are almost always in brick structures and the gunsmiths utilize milling machines, CNC machines and other tools to make their products. Yes, they do use basic tools but those are used to fit and finish the firearm and not to actually manufacture or produce it.</p>

<p>A negative misconception in regards to the firearms produced is the thought that they aren’t heat-treated or are of poor quality. This isn’t true for the most part as they do go through a heat-treating process, however the detractor is that the method of heat-treating leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the cheaper copies. Many users of lower quality copies complain of metal warping and deformation causing a firearm to become inoperable or dangerous to use, this is what leads to people surmising that all arms made in such areas are no good. This is an issue for lower quality copies, a lower quality firearm will have its flaws as it is not built using quality material and to the same tolerances as a firearm made to exact specs with all care taken in production. At the end of the day, you must repeat the same phrase to people who ask why a cheap item is no good; you get what you pay for – if you want a cheap item, you will get a cheap item that will end up having issues or breaking much like any cheap thing you buy.</p>
<p>Moving away from the negatives, let us talk about positives. Apart from the exquisite food that the food gurus cook up there, <em>Darra</em> is also famous for some of the firearms designs to come out of its shops – most notable is the infamous AKMSU which resides in the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. Even though that particular firearm could have been made elsewhere in FATA or <em>Afghanistan</em> by a number of other gunsmiths, it has been linked to <em>Darra</em> due to the town being the main source of arms for sale and the similar types of AK designed copies/modifications known to have come out of there. I could list an almost infinite number of firearms designs displaying their know-how such as the modified SKS made to resemble an AK, or the well-known 8mm bolt-action faux AK and even the more recent AK M4geries. Forget all of those firearms, the gunsmiths themselves are the ones to keep this market and tradition alive, it’s them you have to appreciate as without them there would be more-or-less nothing left of the industry. The ingenuity and skill they have has made <em>Darra</em> a household name throughout the region and extending to much of the world, even to those who are not versed on firearms.</p>

<p><em>Darra</em> has managed to stand against the tide of time and change in an increasingly connected world and holds its own against all odds but has still found a way to use newer technologies and retain its own methods &amp; procedures of manufacturing in its regular business. Even with all that, there is now news that changes things, FATA and Darra with it, will finally be incorporated into the neighboring <em>KPK</em> (<em>Khyber</em> <em>Pakhtunkhwa</em>) province of <em>Pakistan</em>. Regrettably, this means that their own tribal laws will now be abolished and government/regional laws and regulations will be implemented in its place there. The whole town’s industry will be made to register for licenses in either manufacturing or dealing sectors or be shut down. It is said that they will have easier access to raw materials and the costs of business will hopefully decrease, this is something that we can only hope does not destroy this historic industry. <em>Darra</em> will move into the new age with much newer equipment and tooling plus workshops and industrial estates that are planned to be built there and in other places with support of the current federal government of <em>Pakistan</em>. It is planned that arms manufactured there will be available to international markets via some …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it.

    <h3>PDP 11/70 Emulator - v3.1 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
      This emulator came about because years ago I was a programmer for RSTS/E on a PDP 11/45 and had admired the console idle loop light pattern - but I couldn't quite remember how it looked. Given the unavailability of real systems it became time to write
      an emulator!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to start with a PDP 11/45 emulator but the extra memory of a PDP 11/70 became far too attractive (a whole 4MB!). It took some time before I finally produced a
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11-45.html">PDP 11/45</a> version.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met my core objective - I can now see the RSTS/E console light pattern that I was looking for, and found that newer versions (eg v9.6) have a different light pattern. Also I have now seen some of the light patterns for other OSes. RSX and BSD 2.11
      have their own different patterns and Unix V5 and Ultrix operate with absolute minimum light movement (I'm assuming they operates mostly in WAIT mode).
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting all of the operating systems used here presents its own set of challenges - one of which is finding the software in the first place. But one of the most interesting was RSTS/E V06C which has its own
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/RSTSv06c.html">story</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The boot code in this emulator is a custom PDP 11 program running with it's own set of light patterns. It is initially loaded at address 140000 and has a LIGHTS command which operates by mapping and executing a WAIT instruction from a pattern of virtual addresses located in Supervisor
      mode. You can also use the BOOT command to start one of the guest operating systems listed below, or the ODT command to start a version of the Octal Debugging Tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However boot code like this was not part of early PDP 11s. These systems had no BIOS or other software to help get the bare metal started. If you were lucky perhaps the previous boot code would still be intact in non-volatile magnetic core memory, but in general booting the system required toggling in a small bootstrap loader from the front panel. There are listings of bootstrap loaders for various devices
      <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/psychology/pdp-11/bootstraps.html">here</a>.
      If you are a purist don't use the boot code! Instead find the bootstrap code for the device you want to boot from and toggle it in through the switches. However be warned - the boot program will not work unless toggled in perfectly which often takes a few goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of the switch commands for booting from an RK05 where the value at address 1002 selects the unit number (rk0, rk1, rk2, etc). Goodluck!
    </p>
    <pre><b>

      If you wish to toggle in a simple light chaser to the front panel then here are some switch commands which can be used:

    <pre><b>

                            HALT, 001000, LOAD ADDRESS

                            001000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
To restart the initial boot code (if it has not been overwritten) use the switch commands:
    <pre>HALT, 140000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
    <p>
      If you plan to run the emulator repeatedly or for a project, consider downloading the emulator to your own machine or server.
      This will <b>significantly</b> speed any of the emulator disk accesses and response times. All files and emulator OS
      disks can be found in the top level folder of
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/">http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/</a></b> or in the zip file
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.zip">pdp11.zip</a></b> Please note that browser security
      policy may prevent local emulator pages from booting disk images so please read the information in <b>StartChrome.cmd</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in how the emulator works then you can browse the source files on
      <b><a href="https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js">Github</a></b>.
      The main Javascript files are pdp11.js, fpp.js and iopage.js
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many PDP emulators out there and I have never seen what I consider to be a complete list. Some of the really interesting ones can be found by googling terms such as "vhdl pdp 11". However the gold standard is SIMH at
      <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">Trailing Edge</a>.
      A different approach to Javascript PDP 11 emulation can be found at
      <a href="http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pdp11/">www.pcjs.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the first PDP 11 emulator would be SIM-11 written in FORTRAN before the first PDP 11/20 hardware was even built - see
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html"> How the PDP-11 Was Born</a>. There is more PDP 11 history at
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/main.html">www.hampage.hu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if you want your own PDP 11/70 front panel you might consider a

      Happy emulating!

<meta name="twitter:title" content="3 Programming Books for Beginner to Read in 2020">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Programming books can help you level up as a Developer, especially when you are getting started in Software Development or learning a new language.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.datastuff.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/library-869061_640.jpg">
<p>Be it an O’Reilly book, or some of the Computer Science classics, many <strong>programming books</strong> can help you level up in your <strong>career as a Developer</strong>. </p>
<p>This can be especially important when you are <strong>getting started</strong> in Software Development, or in a <strong>programming language</strong> like Python.</p>
<p>These last months have been quite heavy and stressful for many of us, what with the Apocalypse taking place and all that. </p>
<p>So why not take advantage of the situation, and use our newfound free time to double down on our studies and read some programming books?</p>
<p>This may be the time to be twice as productive. As <a href="http://paulgraham.com/gh.html?viewfullsite=1">Paul Graham</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects (…), and in return, you’ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, let’s see book number 1.</p>
<h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-2nd-ebook/dp/B07VSXS4NK/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Automate+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python&amp;qid=1587355901&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=f895004eb4c2d8493cba066d43e4b256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwPi');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07VSXS4NK&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B07VSXS4NK" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>If you’re new to programming, there’s this very early stage when you’re still realizing the <strong>huge potential software can have</strong>, especially when applied to <strong>automation</strong>. </p>
<p>There’s a big difference between performing a simple task manually, and doing it a thousand times faster with a script.</p>
<p>There’s also a case to be made that <strong>Python is the best language to get started</strong> with Software Development, since its syntax and environments can be less daunting than C or Java. This way, you can spend less time doing this kind of “set up” things, freeing you up to focus on what’s important: solving actual problems.</p>
<p>I think <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> really sets itself apart from other programming books in this area: showing you from the get-go which <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/pythons-list-comprehensions-uses-and-advantages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typical day-to-day problems you can solve with Python scripts</a>, or with code, really. </p>
<p>From basic program flow and logic to more advanced tasks like <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/how-to-scrape-the-web-using-python-with-scrapy-spiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Scraping</a>, this book walks with you <strong>all the way from beginner to proficient</strong>, without holding your hand too much.</p>
<p>My favorite project from that book is the one on the chapter <strong><em>Handle the Clipboard Content</em></strong>, which teaches you how to copy and paste text programmatically, eventually making a <em>super-clipboard</em> which stores more than one text.</p>
<p>I have a personal attachment to this book, as I used it to learn Python when I was still in high school, deciding on whether to study Computer Science or not.</p>
<p>If you work in an office and you’re thinking of <strong>pivoting into programming</strong>, this book is for you.</p>
<p>Here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Press-Thomas-Cormen-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=cormen&amp;qid=1587356486&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=09fe74bb316b42a1559a9377aabc1f17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormeni');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B007CNRCAO&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007CNRCAO" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>To every Computer Science student, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormen');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is our bible.</p>
<p>This book has been <strong>sitting on my shelf for years</strong>. </p>
<p>It has helped me <strong>prepare for many exams</strong>, or whenever I need to <strong>brush up on Data Structures</strong> before an interview.</p>
<p>Especially if you’re planning to get into Software Development without getting a college degree, this book is a definite must-read.</p>
<p>This Computer Science book is the most comprehensive study of basic <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> you will find. </p>
<p>It covers:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Algorithmic Complexity</strong> (with the best explanation of Big-O notation I’ve seen so far).</li><li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong> (<em>many</em> sorting algorithms).</li><li><strong>Graphs</strong> and Graph-related Algorithms (especially Binary trees).</li><li><strong>Hash tables</strong> and hashing algorithms.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>, Greedy Algorithms, <strong>Divide-and-Conquer</strong> Algorithms.</li></ul>
<p>These topics and many others are explained in understandable terms, but with <strong>mathematical rigor and correctness</strong>. Not only that, but they often come up both in <strong>day-to-day work</strong>, and in <strong>interview problems</strong>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is a university level book, packed full with formal proofs and mathematical notation. </p>
<p>Even so, I think most developers will agree it is <strong>generally entertaining to read </strong>(<em>if you don’t find Data Structures fun, make sure you’re picking the right career!</em>), and explains most concepts really clearly and succinctly.</p>
<p>If you need to learn how a hash table works, or want to be able to build a binary search tree from scratch, or just need a quick brush up on sorting algorithms before an interview, this is the book for you.</p>
<p>As before, here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/Cormen');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<p>And, speaking of interviews…</p>
<h2>Cracking the Code Interview</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ctci&amp;qid=1587356024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=904a242e267cc92cfb582e366ee3e63a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCIi');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0984782850&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=0984782850" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>Ok, hear me out here. If you’re starting from scratch, I think <a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwP');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-="">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> is the most practical way to start learning Python and programming.</p>
<p>And if you want to <strong>dive deeper</strong> and learn more advanced or theoretical Computer Science concepts, like Algorithms and Data Structures, then <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi">Cormen’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is the undisputed book to go.</p>
<p>However, when all is said and done, there is a craftsmanship that you can only learn by doing, and practicing.</p>
<p>As Charles Darwin once said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If that’s the stage where you feel you’re at, then the best thing you can do is <strong>practice a lot</strong>, with <strong>many different problems</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCI');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> (CTCI, for friends) has to offer.</p>
<p>Sure, the first chapter deals more with the “soft” aspects of a Software Interview (which, again, if you plan to apply for a SWE job eventually, then you should master those too!).</p>
<p>But the rest of the book? Chapter after chapter of <strong>fun, challenging problems</strong> taken straight out of Google’s, Microsoft’s or Facebook’s interview processes. And, they are divided into categories so you can practice one subject at a time.</p>
<p>Feel like you need to polish your <strong>bit manipulation</strong> skills? CTCI has a chapter for you.</p>
<p>Want to practice thinking on your feet and deciding which <strong>Data Structures</strong> fit each kind of problem setup? CTCI has you covered, too.</p>
<p>I did feel my <strong>Software Interview skills</strong> improved after reading CTCI and going through all its exercises. However, that’s definitely not the most important part. The most valuable thing I got from CTCI, is practice: hands-on practice, solving many different problems through code.</p>
<p>To get started, be sure to check out <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CTCIf');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> on Amazon.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So far, I’ve made recommendations for:</p>
<ul><li>A very language-focused programming book for your first steps as a Developer.</li><li>A more academic or broader book for the more theoretically-oriented readers.</li><li>A last, very practical book with a lot of exercises for everyone, old and new to coding.</li></ul>
<p>Each of these programming books has helped me learn a lot. Some have saved my skin on more than one occasion -or exam!-. </p>
<p>When I am preparing for an interview, or a tough exam, there are no other books I’d rather have <em>(though, if you read this far and are thinking ‘hey, he didn’t mention &lt;book_name&gt;!’ this is your time to shine! Hit me up in the comments and I’ll make sure to add it to my reading list)</em>.</p>
<p>I hope at least some of these books will be as helpful to you or your programmer friends, too!</p>
<p>Have you already read any of these books? Are you reading any of them? Let me know what you think of them in the comments! </p>
<p>I’d love to know your opinion, both if you liked them or not. Especially if you can offer a recommendation for what you think is a better alternative!</p>
<p>If you want to get into Data Science or Machine Learning, check out my older post <em><a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/data-science/3-machine-learning-books-that-helped-me-level-up-as-a-data-scientist/" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/endMLB');" data-cf-modified-058f3959a093245ffd08f82d-="">Machine Learning Books to Level Up as a Data Scientists</a></em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Why am I making a programming language?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question keeps rolling around in my head as I'm typing out the code that is
slowly shaping into <em>Rune</em>. Programming is like magic. You imagine it in your
mind, write it out, and there it is. Doing <em>stuff</em> which wasn't being done
before.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I'm scared that people will tell me that I'm wasting my time.
This has already been done, or "Why not just use X?". A thing so glaringly
obvious that all of my efforts are wasted.</p>
<p>But you actually don't need a reason. It can simply be for The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting">Joy of
Creating</a>, and then it's just you. Spending your own time. No harm done.</p>
<p>But I want to talk about why I'm making Rune beyond just for fun. So I'm
dedicating this foreword to it. I feel obligated to describe why this might
matter to others.</p>
<p>So here's why I'm making a new programming language.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of effort working on <a href="https://github.com/udoprog/OxidizeBot">OxidizeBot</a>, a Twitch bot that streamers
can use to add commands and other interactive things in their chat. I built it
for myself while streaming. When adding features I always spend way too much time
tinkering with it. Making it as generic as possible so it can solve more than
just one problem. When it's a personal project, I don't care about being
efficient. I care much more about doing things the right way.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ok, I <em>sometimes</em> do that professionally as well. But a working environment is
much more constrained. Personal projects should be fun!</p>
<p>Anyway, that means the bot isn't overly specialized to only suit my needs and
can be used by others. It's starting to see a little bit of that use now which
is a lot of fun. I made something which helps people do something cool.</p>
<p>All the commands in the bot are written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/udoprog/OxidizeBot/tree/master/bot/src/module">compiled straight into
the bot</a>. This is nice because Rust is an incredible language. But Rust is also
complex. Not needlessly mind you. I believe it's complex because it
tackles <em>really hard problems</em>. And that usually comes with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterbed_theory">base level of
complexity</a> it's very hard to get rid of.</p>
<p>But it's still tricky enough that streamers who have limited programming
experience struggle getting up and running. I wanted them to be able to write
their own commands. Ones they could just drop into a folder and <em>presto</em> -
you're up and running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To this day I've tutored two of these streamers who were interested in
learning Rust to write their own commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Embedding a Rust compiler isn't feasible. So I started looking into dynamic
programming languages. Ones that could be embedded into an existing application
with little to no effort. That seamlessly integrates with its environment.
A number of candidates came up, but the one that stood out the most to me was
<a href="https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai">Rhai</a>.</p>
<p>So why is Rhai awesome? It has Rust-like syntax. The runtime is fully written in
mostly safe Rust, and can be easily embedded. Hooking up Rust functions is a
piece of cake.</p>
<p>But Rhai has a set of design decisions which didn't <em>exactly</em> scratch my itch.
The more I used it, the more I got inspired and started thinking about things
that could be changed or added. <a href="https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai/commits?author=udoprog">I contributed a bit to the project</a>. And it
started to dawn on me that Rhai's approach wasn't exactly what I wanted. There's
nothing wrong with this. The authors of Rhai have specific goals and ideas of
what they want to accomplish. While it would be feasible to push Rhai in a
different direction, the project would emerge looking much different on the
other side. Which wouldn't be fair towards the people leveraging Rhai's
strengths today. So I wanted a clean slate to find my own compromises. To
discover freely what works and doesn't work well.</p>
<p>When I started working on Rune I had the following <em>rough</em> goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance should be comparable to Lua and Python (And eventually LuaJIT when
we have cranelift).</li>
<li>Scripts should compile quickly.</li>
<li>Rune should feel like "Rust without types".</li>
<li>Excellent support for asynchronous programming (i.e. native <code>select</code> statements).</li>
<li>Be as good as Rhai when it comes to integrating with native Rust.</li>
<li>Work well through C bindings.</li>
<li>A minimalistic stack-based runtime that is strictly single threaded*.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*: If this feels like a step backwards to you, don't worry too much. We can
still have concurrency and threading using async code as you'll see later in
this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rune is now in a state where I want people to poke at it. Not <em>too</em> hard mind
you. It's still early days. The compiler is very much in flux and a
miscompilation will definitely cause the wrong closure to be called. You know,
the one that <em>doesn't</em> doesn't perform your security checks 😅.</p>
<p>But the more poking and prodding people do, the more issues will be found. Every
solved issue brings Rune one step close to being production ready. Every set of
eyeballs that takes a look can bring fresh perspective and ideas, making the
project better for me and everyone else.</p>
<p>I really want to thank Jonathan Turner and all the contributors to the Rhai
project. They have been an an immense inspiration to me. If you need an embedded
scripting engine that is more mature right now than <em>Rune</em>, please do take
<em>Rhai</em> for a spin.</p>
<p>You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/rune-rs/rune/">on its GitHub page</a>. I hope you'll enjoy using
it as much as I've enjoyed making it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-611">

	<div>
		




<p>Last month <a href="https://danielvassallo.com/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts/">I left my job at Amazon to work for myself</a>. I’m no longer an employee, but if I were ever to become one again, here’s what I’ll keep in mind.</p>



<h3 id="mce_4">Many things won’t be within my control.</h3>



<p>Getting promoted, getting a raise, getting recognized, getting on an important project — these are all things that an employee can never fully control, regardless of the effort made. Some people I worked with made their well-being dependent on these things. I tried not to. It’s normal to be disappointed by undesirable outcomes, but I try to avoid having externally controlled outcomes play a role in my satisfaction and self-esteem.</p>



<h3>My satisfaction comes from challenges, not from outcomes.</h3>



<p>Most companies function by setting goals and holding people accountable for the outcomes. The problem is, I don’t consider myself to be goal-driven. I don’t set goals for myself; I cannot remember ever setting one. I have targets, but I don’t try to hold myself accountable for the outcomes. Employers, however, care a lot about outcomes, and as an employee I always wanted to do my best to deliver what my employer wanted. So my approach was to mentally transform the company’s goals into small daily challenges. Tackling a challenge, brainstorming solutions, trying my best, finding an easy way out — doing those things can give me satisfaction regardless of the outcome. It’s the journey that matters to me, not the outcome, and the journey is just a stream of daily challenges coupled with my best attempts to tackle them.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Trying to get promoted is the fastest way not to get promoted.</h3>



<p>Promotions are usually the biggest carrot that employers dangle in front of employees to “motivate them”. A promotion doesn’t cost the employer anything, which is definitely not the case for other motivational incentives, such as a bonus, or a day off. Luckily for the employer, employees tend to want promotions a lot — probably more than they want bonuses and days off. However, once again, promotions are outcomes controlled by many variables and by random subjective people. They are never really in the employee’s control. My trick was not to desire one. I never asked my manager what I needed to do to get a promotion, I never asked to discuss my career plan, I never looked for a career mentor, I never tried to impress those that would be evaluating me — nothing of that sort. I just focused on the things in my control: doing the best work I could, as if it were my own company, and treating others how I wanted to be treated.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">The company’s opinions are not necessarily my opinions.</h3>



<p>Being a good employee is like being a lawyer acting for a client. The lawyer’s job is to make the best case for the client, regardless of what the lawyer might think. My job as an employee was to do the best work I could, the way the company wanted, based on the values and opinions of the company. Just like the lawyer, I would occasionally voice my opinion privately when we didn’t see things entirely eye to eye. But it was always on me to disagree and commit. And also just like the lawyer, there were always moral and legal lines I wouldn’t cross. But as long as I held the job, I carried out my duty. For example, whenever I talked to customers, I always gave them the company’s opinion of the products, not my own. That’s how it’s supposed to be. If I were to employ people, that’s what I would want them to do.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Meaningless work is the cost of doing business.</h3>



<p>Most policies, processes, and procedures that I’ve been subject to by my employers had things in them that I thought were completely meaningless, and that I wouldn’t do if I were in charge. This work was the hardest type for me to do, especially when it carried on for days, weeks, and months. The bigger the company and the more distant the policy-makers are from the makers, the more of this you can expect. The best mechanism I found to convince my procrastinating self to persevere with this work was to think of it as a cost of doing business, rather than a purposeless task. That simple mental switch suddenly gives it meaning in the complex universe of a company.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Rewards kill my enthusiasm.</h3>



<p>I never liked having incentives dangled in front of me, and I don’t trust people that tell me: If you do this, you’ll get that. I’ve hated this for as long as I can remember, because it always feels like somebody is trying to control me or trying to change my behavior. I respond very negatively to the perception of being controlled, so as much as I can, I try to avoid such environments. When I can’t do that, I try to ignore the incentives, and just focus on the things that I can control, such as doing the best work that I can. This has helped me to find peace of mind in environments filled with carrots and sticks.</p>



<h3 id="mce_20">Only intrinsic motivation lasts.</h3>



<p>There are things that I feel intrinsically driven to do, even when there’s no incentive or punishment compelling me to do them. The best kind of work for me is work driven by this intrinsic energy. I might be doing other things, but I would always be looking for opportunities that allow me to spend more time on work driven by my intrinsic motivation. My last job was very good by every measure, but once I discovered an alternative path that would allow me to use my intrinsic motivation more, it became practically impossible for me to stay. If I were to become an employee again, I’d be very careful not to let the extrinsic rewards distort how I measure job opportunities. Once I attain a certain level of financial security, the satisfaction from rewards wears off quickly, and only intrinsic motivation lasts.</p>

    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/TI99-IMG_7143.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A"></p>
<p>When I was around 13-14 years old, home computers were just appearing
on the market.  The first machines that I remember to have been sold
in the large department stores in Berlin were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">Atari 400 and
800</a> as well as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a>.
At the time, these machines were incredibly expensive, but me and my
friends often hung out in the stores to play around with these
machines and dream of owning them.</p>
<p>I found the TI-99/4A to be very good looking with its late 1970ies US
design and its nice keyboard.  In magazines I read that the machine
was slow and crippled, though, and the british home computers were
much cheaper, so I never became friends with the TI back then.</p>
<p>Recently, I found a machine cheaply on sale on an auction site and
bought it, despite the fact that neither the power supply nor the TV
modulator was included with the system.  The power brick was easy to
buy separately and I thought that I would not want the TV modulator
anyway.  I figured that the (european) TI outputs a component (YPbPr)
video signal and decided to try some conversion circuits that I found
on the Internet until I got something that one of my monitors could
display.</p>
<p>The first two attempts that I made failed, though.  One of the
schematics I had was a generic YPbPr conversion circuit based on a
bunch of opamps.  It did not produce a picture at all, but not knowing
enough about video signal encoding I did not manage to debug the
problem.  The same happened with another schematic that supposedly was
specifically designed for the TI-99/4A, but did not work for me
either.  Finally, I run across a new adapter circuit called
<a href="https://tms-rgb.com/">TMS-RGB</a> designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/npiegdon">Nicholas
Piegdon</a> just this year.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-pcb.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB PCB"></p>
<p>The TMS-RGB is a generic RGB converter for systems using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918">TMS9929A</a>
chip, i.e. the TI-99/4A, some MSX systems and the ColecoVision.  It is
a tightly packed PCB with surface mounted components meant to be
soldered onto the solder side of the PCB of the machine to be
converted.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-on-ti.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB mounted on TI-99/4A board"></p>
<p>To me, getting the PCB fabricated in China, sourcing the components
and soldering them onto the board with a microscope was part of the
fun.  It was not all that easy, though, and the TMS-RGB website has
some shops listed that sell the board ready for installation.
Installing it in the machine is very easy thanks to the excellent
videos published on the site.</p>
<p>The TMS-RGB converts the YPrPb signal to RGB + Sync, but it does not
change the overall timing.  This means that one either needs a monitor
that can deal with TV format RGB signals (i.e. one that has a RGB
SCART Input or a CBM 1084), or an upscaler that converts the signal to
match the expectations of a more modern computer monitor.  I bought a
cheap GBS-8200 upscaler board which produces a VGA output and it
worked fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/ti-and-upscaler.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A board and GNS-8200 upscaler"></p>
<p>In fact, the picture quality that I get with this on my TFT monitor is
just awesome.  The pixels are crisp and the is no blur, jail bars or
ghosting.  I can recommend the TMS-RGB board to anyone who wants to
equip their TMS9929A based hardware with a better video output.  The
overall cost for the PCB's, components and the upscaler board was
around 70 Euros.</p>

				<p>So the other day I both defined Tcl procedures all by myself and used them interactively, and I liked it, to the point where it felt like some kind of local optimum. This entry is an attempt to cope with the trauma of liking Tcl, by means of rationalizing it. I'll first tell the story of my fascinating adventures, and then I'll do the rationalizing (to skip the oh-so-personal first part, go straight for the bullet points).</p>
<p>Here's what I was doing. I have this board. The board has a chip on it. The chip has several processors in it. There's a processor in there that is a memory-mapped device, and I talk to it using CPU load/store commands. The CPU is itself a JTAG target, and I talk to it via a probe, issuing those load/store commands. To the probe I talk via USB using an ugly console that can't even handle the clipboard properly. The console speaks Tcl.</p>
<p>Net result: in order to talk to the memory-mapped processor, I have to speak Tcl. Or I can use a memory view window in a graphical debugger. Except some addresses will change the processor state when read (pop an item from a LIFO, that sort of thing). So no, memory view windows aren't a good idea – you have to aim for the specific address, not shoot at whole address ranges. Damn, just who thought of defining the hardware in such a stupid way? Why, it was me. Little did I know that I was thereby inflicting Tcl on myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's this bug I have to debug now, and as far as I know it could be in at least three different pieces of software or in two different pieces of hardware, and I don't like any of the 5 options very much, and I want to find out what it is already. So at the ugly probe console I type things like <code>word 0x1f8cc000</code> (reads the processor status), <code>word 0x1f8cc008 2</code> (halts the execution), <code>word 0x1f8cc020 0x875</code> (places a breakpoint). I get sick and tired of this in about 2 minutes, when the command history is large enough to make the probability of hitting Enter at the wrong auto-completed command annoying. It's annoying to run the wrong command because if I ruin the processor state, it will take me minutes to reproduce that state, because the program reads input via JTAG, which is as slow as it gets.</p>
<p>So I figure this isn't the last bug I'm gonna deal with this way, and it's therefore time for Extending my Environment, equipping myself with the Right Tools for the Job, Tailored to my needs, utilizing the Scripting capabilities of the system. I hate that, I really do. Is there something more distressing than the development of development tools for the mass market of a single developer? Can a programmer have a weakness more pathetic than the tendency to solve easy generic meta-problems when the real, specific problems are too hard? Is there software more disgusting in nature than plug-ins and extensions for a butt-ugly base system? But you know what, I really fail to remember 0x1f8cwhat the breakpoint address is. This story has one hexadecimal value too much for my brain. OK, then. Tcl.</p>
<p>I decided to have one entry point procedure, <code>pmem</code>, that would get a memory-mapped processor id, 'cause there are many of them, and then call one of several functions with the right base address, so that <code>pmem 0 pc</code> would do the same as <code>pmem_pc 0x1f8c0000</code>. Well, in Tcl that's as simple as it gets. Tcl likes to generate and evaluate command strings. More generally, Tcl likes strings. In fact, it likes them more than anything else. In normal programming languages, things are variables and expressions by default. In Tcl, they are strings. <code>abc</code> isn't a variable reference – it's a string. <code>$abc</code> is the variable reference. <code>a+b/c</code> isn't an expression – it's a string. <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code> is the expression. Could you believe that? <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code>. Isn't that ridiculous?</p>
<p>In fact, that was one of my main applications for Tcl: ridiculing it. I remember reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130385603">the huge Tcl/Tk book by Brent Welch</a> with my friend once. There was a power outage and it was past the time when the last UPS squeaked its last squeak. And the book was there 'cause the hardware guys use it for scripting their lovecraftian toolchain. We really did have fun. Tears went down my cheeks from laughter. Even people with the usual frightened/mean comments about those geeks who laugh their brains out over a Tcl book  didn't spoil it. So, ridiculing Tcl, my #1 use for it. The other use is the occasional scripting of the hardware hackers' lovecraftian toolchain. Overall, I don't use Tcl very much.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Tcl is that it's still a dynamic language, and reasonably laconic at that, modulo quoting and escaping. So I enter the usual addictive edit/test cycle using <code>tclsh &lt; script</code>. N minutes down the road (I really don't know what N was), I've finished my 2 screenfuls of Tcl and the fun starts. I actually start debugging the goddamn thing.<br>

<p><em>Weeee!</em> <em>HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY!</em></p>
<p>You have no idea just how happy this made me. Yeah, I know, I'm overreacting. I'll tell you what: debug various kinds of hardware malfunction for several months, and you'll be able to identify with the warped notion of value one gains through such process. On second thought, I don't know if I'd really recommend it. Remember how I told <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html">low-level programming was easy</a>? It is, fundamentally, but there's this other angle from which it's quite a filthy endeavor. I promise to blog about it. I owe it to the people who keep telling me "so low-level is easy?" each time they listen to me swear heartily at a degenerate hardware setup where nothing works no matter what you try. I owe it to myself – me wants to reach a closure here. Why should I tolerate being regularly misquoted at the moments of my deepest professional catharsis?</p>
<p>Aaaanyway, in just N minutes, I bootstrapped myself something not unlike a retarded version of gdb, the way it would work if the symbol table of my program was stripped. But no matter – I have <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/addr2line1.html">addr2line</a> for that. And the nice thing about my retarded debugger front-end is that it looks like shell commands: <code>blah blah blah</code>. As opposed to <code>blah("blah","blah")</code>. And this, folks, is what I think Tcl, being a tool command language, gets right.</p>
<p>I come from the world of pop infix languages (C/Java/Python/Ruby/you name it). Tcl basically freaks me out with its two fundamental choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tcl likes literals, not variables.</strong> Tcl: <code>string, $var.</code> Pop infix: <code>"string", var</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tcl likes commands, not expressions.</strong> Tcl: <code>doit this that, [expr $this+$that]</code>. Pop infix: <code>doit("this","that"), this+that</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, pop infix languages (and I use the term in the most non-judgmental, factual way), pop infix languages are optimized for programming (duh, they are programming languages). Programming is definitions. Define a variable and it will be easy to use it, and computing hairy expressions from variables is also easy. Tcl is optimized for usage. Most of the time, users give simple commands. Command names and literal parameters are easy. If you are a sophisticated user, and you want to do <code>pmem 0 bkpt [expr [pmem 0 pc] + 1]</code>, go ahead and do it. A bit ugly, but on the other hand, simple commands are really, really simple.</p>
<p>And eventually, simple commands become all that matters for the user, because the sophisticated user grows personal shortcuts, which abstract away variables and expressions, so you end up with <code>pmem 0 bkpt nextpc</code> or something. Apparently, <em>flat function calls with literal arguments is what interactive program usage is all about.</em></p>
<p>I'm not saying that I'm going to use Tcl as the extension language of my next self-made lovecraftian toolchain (I was thinking more along the lines of doing that one in D and using D as my scripting language, 'cause it compiles fast enough and it's apparently high-level enough). I haven't thought enough about this, but the grotesque escaping/quoting in Tcl still freaks me out; I don't want to <em>program</em> like that. All I'm saying is that I like the <em>interactive</em> part. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short code matters a lot; short interactive commands matter <strong>much</strong> more.</li>
<li>An interactive command language must be a real language (loops, functions and all).</li>
<li>Tcl allows for the shortest commands and it's a real language. I'm <em>fascinated</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Short code vs short commands</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people have noticed that keeping your code short is extremely important. More surprisingly, many people fail to notice this, probably because "1 line is better than 5" doesn't sound that convincing. OK, think about 100K lines vs 500K and you'll get the idea. Oh, there are also those dirty Perl/shell one-liners that make one doubt about this. I've known a Bastard Programmer that used 2K bash one-liners as his weapon of choice. OK then, so the actual rule must be "short code is good unless it's written by a bastard". But it's the same core idea.</p>
<p>So we have the Architect type, who loves lots of classes which delegate work to each other, and we have the Enlightened type, who wants to write and read less. And the Enlightened type can rant and rave all day how Python, or Ruby, or Lisp make it oh-so-easy to define data structure literals, or to factor out stuff using meta-programming, or some other thing an Architect just never gets. And I'm all with it.</p>
<p>And then we have interactive shells. And in Python it's <code>doit("xx","yy")</code>. And in Lisp it's <code>(doit "xx" "yy")</code>, or <code>(doit :xx :yy)</code>, or <code>(doit xx yy)</code> if you make it a macro. And in Ruby it's <code>doit :xx :yy</code>, if you use symbols and omit parens. And that's about as good as you can get without using your own parser as in <code>doit "xx yy"</code>, which can suck in the (more rare) case when you do need to evaluate expressions before passing parameters, and doesn't completely remove overhead. Also note how all these languages use (), which makes you press Shift, instead of [] which doesn't. Ruby and Perl let you omit (), …</p></div></div>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-3/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we finished adding
the rest of the constants as tagged pointer immediates. Since it’s not very
useful to have only values (no way to operate on them), we’re going to add some
<em>primitive unary functions</em>.</p>

<p>“Primitive” means here that they are built into the compiler, so we won’t
actually compile the call to an assembly procedure call. This is also called a
<em>compiler intrinsic</em>. “Unary” means the functions will take only one argument.
“Function” is a bit of a misnomer because these functions won’t be real values
that you can pass around as variables. You’ll only be able to use them as
literal names in calls.</p>

<p>Though we’re still not adding a reader/parser, we can imagine the syntax for
this looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>integer?</span> <span>(</span><span>integer-&gt;char</span> <span>(</span><span>add1</span> <span>96</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Today we also tackle <em>nested</em> function calls and subexpressions.</p>

<p>Adding function calls will require adding a new compiler datastructure, an
addition to the AST, but <em>not</em> to the compiled code. The compiled code will
still only know about the immediate types.</p>

<p>Ghuloum proposes we add the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add1</code>, which takes an integer and adds 1 to it</li>
  <li><code>sub1</code>, which takes an integer and subtracts 1 from it</li>
  <li><code>integer-&gt;char</code>, which takes an integer and converts it into a character
(like <code>chr</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>char-&gt;integer</code>, which takes a character and converts it into an integer
(like <code>ord</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>null?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>nil</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>zero?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>0</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>not</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>false</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>integer?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is an integer and
false otherwise</li>
  <li><code>bool?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is a boolean and
false otherwise</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions <code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, and the <code>char</code>/<code>integer</code> conversion functions
will be our first real experience dealing with object encoding in the compiled
code. What fun!</p>

<p>The implementations for <code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>integer</code>?, and <code>bool?</code> are so
similar that I am only going to reproduce one or two in this post. The rest
will be visible at
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/tekknolagi.github.com/blob/3d956655e48a124e828a8847282caa71b1c8b63f/assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c">assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c</a>.</p>

<p>In order to implement these functions, we’ll also need some more instructions
than <code>mov</code> and <code>ret</code>. Today we’ll add:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add</code></li>
  <li><code>sub</code></li>
  <li><code>shl</code></li>
  <li><code>shr</code></li>
  <li><code>or</code></li>
  <li><code>and</code></li>
  <li><code>cmp</code></li>
  <li><code>setcc</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the implementations of <code>shl</code>, <code>shr</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>and</code> are so
straightforward — just like <code>mov</code>, really — I’ll also omit them from the
post. The implementations of <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>cmp</code>, and <code>setcc</code> are more
interesting.</p>

<h3 id="the-fundamental-data-structure-of-lisp">The fundamental data structure of Lisp</h3>

<p>Pairs, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cells</a>,
two-tuples, and probably other things too, are the fundamental data structure
of Lisp. At least the original Lisp. Nowadays we have fancy structures like
vectors, too.</p>

<p>Pairs are a container for precisely two other objects. I’ll call them <code>car</code> and
<code>cdr</code> for historical<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and consistency reasons, but you can call them
whatever you like. Regardless of name, they could be represented as a C struct
like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is useful for holding pairs of objects (think coordinates, complex
numbers, …) but it is also incredibly useful for making linked lists. Linked
lists in Lisp are comprised of a <code>car</code> holding an object and the <code>cdr</code> holding
another list. Eventually the last <code>cdr</code> holds <code>nil</code>, signifying the end of the
list. Take a look at this handy diagram.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/lisp/03_lists_cons.svg">
  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cons cell list, courtesy of Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This represents the list <code>(list 42 69 613)</code>, which can also be denoted <code>(cons
42 (cons 69 (cons 613 nil)))</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll use these lists to represent the syntax trees for Lisp, so we’ll need to
implement pairs to compile list programs.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-pairs">Implementing pairs</h3>

<p>In previous posts we implemented the immediate types the same way in the
compiler and in the compiled code. I originally wrote this post doing the same
thing: manually laying out object offsets myself, reading and writing from
objects manually. The motivation was to get you familiar with the memory
layout in the compiled code, but ultimately it ended up being too much content
too fast. We’ll get to memory layouts when we start allocating pairs in the
compiled code.</p>

<p>In the compiler we’re going to use C structs instead of manual memory layout.
This makes the code a little bit easier to read. We’ll still tag the pointers,
though.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kPairTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1</span><span>;</span>        <span>// 0b001</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>0x7</span><span>);</span>  <span>// 0b000...0111</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>~</span><span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>;</span> <span>// 0b1111...1000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This adds the pair tag and some masks. As we noted in the previous posts, the
heap object tags are all in the lowest three bits of the pointer. We can mask
those out using this handy utility function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>uword</span> <span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>obj</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll need to use this whenever we want to actually access a struct member.
Speaking of struct members, here’s the definition of <code>Pair</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here are some functions for allocating and manipulating the <code>Pair</code> struct,
to keep the implementation details hidden:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>tag</span><span>,</span> <span>uword</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There a couple important things to note.</p>

<p>First, <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> very intentionally zeroes out the memory it allocates.
If the members were left uninitialized, it might be possible to read off a
struct member that had an invalid pointer in <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code>. If we
zero-initialize it, the member pointers represent the object <code>0</code> by default.
Nothing will crash.</p>

<p>Second, we keep moving our <code>ASTNode</code> pointers through <code>AST_as_pair</code>. This
function has two purposes: catch invalid uses (via the <code>assert</code> that the object
is indeed a <code>Pair</code>) and also mask out the lower bits. Otherwise we’d have to do
the masking in every operation individually.</p>

<p>Third, I abstracted out the <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> so we don’t expose the <code>calloc</code>
function everywhere. This allows us to later swap out the allocator for
something more intelligent, like a bump allocator, an arena allocator, etc.</p>

<p>And since memory allocated must eventually be freed, there’s a freeing function
too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>AST_is_heap_object</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_car</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_cdr</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>free</span><span>((</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This assumes that each <code>ASTNode*</code> owns the references to all of its members. So
<strong>don’t borrow references</strong> to share between objects. If you need to store a
reference to an object, <strong>make sure you own it</strong>. Otherwise you’ll get a double
free. In practice this shouldn’t bite us too much because each program is one
big tree.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-symbols">Implementing symbols</h3>

<p>We also need symbols! I mean, we could try mapping all the functions we need to
integers, but that wouldn’t be very fun. Who wants to try and debug a program
crashing on <code>function#67</code>? Not me. So let’s add a datatype that can represent
names of things.</p>

<p>As above, we’ll need to tag the pointers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x5</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 0b101</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then our struct definition.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>cstr</span><span>[];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve chosen this variable-length object representation because it’s similar to
how we’re going to allocate symbols in assembly and the mechanism in C isn’t so
gnarly. This struct indicates that the memory layout of a <code>Symbol</code> is a length
field immediately followed by that number of bytes in memory. Note that having
this variable array in a struct is a <strong>C99 feature</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t have C99 or don’t like this implementation, that’s fine. Just
store a <code>char*</code> and allocate another object for that string.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could also opt to not store the length <em>at all</em> and instead NUL-terminate
it. This has the advantage of not dealing with variable-length arrays (it’s
just a tagged <code>char*</code>) but has the disadvantage of an <code>O(n)</code> length lookup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we can add our <code>Symbol</code> allocator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>

<span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_new_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>data_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>strlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// for NUL</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>kSymbolTag</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>Symbol</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>
  <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>data_length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cstr</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>node</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how we have to manually specify the size we want. It’s a little fussy, but
it works.</p>

<p>Storing the NUL byte or not is up to you. It saves one byte per string if you
don’t, but it makes printing out strings in the debugger a bit of a pain since
you can’t just treat them like normal C strings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some Lisp implementations use a <em>symbol table</em> to ensure that symbols
allocated with equivalent C-string values return <em>the same pointer</em>. This
allows the implementations to test for symbol equality by testing pointer
equality. I think we can sacrifice a bit of memory and runtime speed for
implementation simplicity, so I’m not going to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s add the rest of the utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>node</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This was originally posted on my personal blog in 2012.  It's still highly relevent today.</p>

<p>Who this is for: developers who have an idea.</p>

<p>Why you should read it: so you don’t waste your life by building something nobody wants.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I’m 35, and until last year, I started building companies by creating a product.</p>

<p>Last year, when starting SocialWOD, my biz partner Ryan refused to write code without first talking to 20+ customers and getting commitments to pay us money for a solution to a well-defined problem of theirs.</p>

<p>Having gone down the “build first” path enough without significant success, I was up for trying a new approach. Conceptually it seemed to make sense that we’d be able to better solve our customers’ problems if we understood their problems better.</p>

<p>To boot, we decided not to build until we had verbal financial commitments from customers for our proposed solution.</p>

<p>The result? <strong>We were able to charge money from day one for a two-screen CRUD app. We were able to do so because we had honed in on a specific problem worth paying for, and we had financial commitments before we wrote a single line of app code.</strong></p>

<p>Read on for some of the hard-earned lessons that’ll help you grow your biz.</p>
      <h2 id="dont-build-first">
        
        
          Don’t build first <a href="#dont-build-first">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Building first puts you at a disadvantage. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Your job as an entrepreneur is to increase the odds that your business will succeed. Put another way, your job is to reduce the risks that prevent your venture from succeeding.</p>

<p>There are several types of risk that can kill your company.</p>

<p>Big ones include (but aren’t limited to):</p>

<p>– Team (are <em>we</em> the right people to execute)
– Market (do people want to buy it) ← usually the biggest risk
– Technology (can we build it) ← most hackers start here. Oops.</p>

<p>I’m gonna talk about why most hackers start reducing the technology risk (by building a product) when they should start by reducing the market risk.</p>

<p>And I’m going to give you a script you can use in interviews to learn more about the market side of your biz.</p>
    
      <h2 id="why-people-start-with-code">
        
        
          Why people start with code <a href="#why-people-start-with-code">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>If you’re a developer, writing code is the fun part.  Code can be bent to your will to do what you want it to do. You know when it works, and when it doesn’t. It’s clean.</p>

<p>People have an innate desire for control, and code can be controlled.</p>

<p>Code is your comfort zone, so it’s what you (and I!) fall back on.</p>

<p>But since you can build almost certainly build the solution, it’s almost always the wrong place to start.</p>
    
      <h3 id="where-you-should-start">
        
        
          Where you should start <a href="#where-you-should-start">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<blockquote>“A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful.” – Paul Graham</blockquote>

<p>You should start by understanding your market.</p>

<p>This is vague. More precisely, you should understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who your customers are</li>
  <li>the specific problem your potential customers have</li>
  <li>why this is a problem for them</li>
  <li>how painful this problem is for them</li>
  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to do this is by talking to real live people: picking up the phone, going out to coffee, etc, asking good questions, and listening.</p>

<p>For most hackers, talking to customers to figure out their unmet needs is scary, and always messier than code. It’s out of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>The rational response is “Righty-o! Talk to customers first – that makes sense.”</p>

<p>The emotional response is “Oh shit. Who should I talk to? What should I say? Won’t I just be better off building this feature?”</p>

<p>The way I overcome this emotional trauma is to think about the insights I’ve gleaned from talking to customers in the past, and more importantly: <strong>how much time and frustration these conversations have saved me. Hackers hate working on stuff nobody uses.</strong></p>

<p>Really, it’s simple: the fastest way to build something people want is to understand their problems. And the fastest way to understand their problems is to listen to what they have to say.</p>
    
      <h2 id="ok-how-can-i-go-about-talking-to-customers">
        
        
          OK, how can I go about talking to customers? <a href="#ok-how-can-i-go-about-talking-to-customers">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Find some potential customers.</p>

<p>I may go into this in a future article, but finding a few individual customers in your market should <a href="https://www.reemer.com/articles/www.linkedin.com">be</a> <a href="https://www.reemer.com/articles/www.google.com">easy</a>.</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-should-i-say">
        
        
          What should I say? <a href="#what-should-i-say">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Here’s an template of an email we used at SocialWOD when referred to potential customers (we make software for CrossFit Gyms)</p>

<blockquote>Hi First_name,<p>

I spoke to referrer_full_name at referring_gym_name recently.</p><p>

He said you might be interested in sharing some insights about problem_we’re_solving, and hearing about what we’ve learned talking to your peers.</p><p>

I’m not trying to sell anything – just looking to learn about your business’s problems so I can build something that helps you grow your business.</p><p>

Cheers,</p><p>

your_name</p></blockquote>

<p>The keys to this email are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re promising to provide value (share some insights)</li>
  <li>You want to help them grow their business</li>
  <li>You’re not selling anything</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://smartfaststartup.com/2011/09/20/how-to-become-a-must-have/">Smart Fast Startup has a great cold-calling method to validate whether your idea solves a problem that people want to pay for.</a></p>

<p>This should get you a few meetings.</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-to-say-in-your-meetings">
        
        
          What to say in your meetings <a href="#what-to-say-in-your-meetings">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Your goal with these meetings should be to hone in on answers for each of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who your customers are</li>
  <li>the specific problem your potential customers have</li>
  <li>why this is a problem for them</li>
  <li>how painful this problem is for them</li>
  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say you had an idea about product for movie theater owners that would pipe buttered popcorn (and other) smells into theaters to help drive concession sales.</p>

<p>Here’s the sort of questions I would ask a theater owner:</p>

<p>Q: Tell me about your business. What are your biggest problems? What keeps you up at night? Why?</p>

<p>Trying to learn:
What are the big problems they have in their biz? Why are they problems? What happens when those problems aren’t solved?</p>

<p>Q: What are the key metrics that drive your business?
Trying to learn: What are the key levers in their biz – concession dollars per ticket sold? Straight up ticket sales? etc. Is your solution potentially a must-have or a nice to have?</p>

<p>Q: (if they don’t mention concessions) What impact do concessions have on your business?
Trying to learn: Is your solution even potentially valuable to them? How much, or why not? (Make sure you understand this. Keep unpeeling the onion; make sure you understand this fully. Try not to make assumptions here.)</p>

<p>Q: Have you looked at anything to help you with this problem? How have they worked for you? Where did you find them?
Trying to learn: Learning what else is out there? Are those solutions working, or not? What distribution channels might you need to be in?</p>

<p>Q: I have some ideas about products that might be useful. Can I give you a 1-liner description and you tell me if we’re crazy or may be on to something?
Trying to learn: This is to get a sense of whether your idea may even be valuable to them… you don’t want to get into specifics really, just tease them and get high-level feedback.</p>
    
      <h2 id="also-ask">
        
        
          Also ask: <a href="#also-ask">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Is it ok if I follow up as we develop our ideas? (I’ve never had anybody say no to this)</li>
  <li>Is there anybody else who you think we should speak to who have the same kinds of problems you do? (these are the people you call next)</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal with these interviews is to <em>listen</em> and <em>learn</em>, not to sell. Learn where you’re right, where you’re wrong, what words your customers use, what big problems they have, and how you can adapt your solution to solve those problems.</p>

<p>After a couple interviews you’ll be able to provide insight and become valuable to the people you’re speaking with, which makes you
even more trusted (“oh we just spoke to person XYZ at ABC corp… he was feeling the same pain, you’re not alone!” OR BETTER “just spoke to XYZ at ABC… he solved the problem you’re facing by doing 123”.)</p>

<p>And after 10-20 of these you’ll know a crap ton more about your market, and whether this is a problem even worth your time.</p>

<p>This process isn’t easy. But recurring themes will emerge that will help you hone in on a problem worth solving without writing a single line of code. The reason you do this first is because you need to do this whether you write code. You might as well do this <em>before</em> you spend a few months writing code, so you can figure out what to build.</p>

<p>Now that you better understand the problem and market, the next post will cover what you can do with that information (hint: it’s not “build the product”).</p>

	<p>I bet everybody knows this feeling when you get an interesting idea in your head, and 
you think – that is it! I need to do it! You start to dig into, but the first Google 
request shows that somebody has already implemented it. Bummer. I had one of those ideas
the other day.</p>

<p>Since around a year or a bit more, I am into running. For tracking my running time and 
routes I am using an application, of course. It is nice to look at some statistics. After
one of the runs, I looked at the route, and it reminded me of some figure or a drawing.
And then a thought came to me – what if we draw something  on a map while running using a 
GPS tracker?! Just imagine: a whole community running and sharing their routes!</p>

<p>My first deliberate attempt to draw during running was a letter “M“. It is supposed to be 
the first letter in either my wife’s name, or in the word “Metallica“. I’m not sure yet.</p>

	</figure>
</div>

<p>As it turned out, I am not the only one to come up with this idea. Drawing on a map with 
a GPS tracker is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_drawing">GPS Art</a>. It originated in 90s, and, of course, became more 
popular with a spread of mobile GPS devices. Check out hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gpsart&amp;src=typed_query">#gpsart</a>
on Twitter for inspiration.</p>

<p>The community also has its heroes. For example, the largest drawings on Earth belong to
Japanese artist Yasushi Takahashi. Here is a word “peace“… <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1nDdvPvZtyeh0a6uOxGTu7rEzRqI&amp;ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C26.488384499999995&amp;z=2">60,794 km long</a>.</p>

<div>
	<figure>
		
			<img src="https://guzalexander.com/static/img/posts/gpsart_peace.png" alt="">
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>And here is “Marry Me“ <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1m8Sevf2iWZT83ax5x2q6n8P8tBY&amp;ll=38.29853440547071%2C137.199813859375&amp;z=6">over the whole Japan</a>.</p>

<div>
	<figure>
		
			<img src="https://guzalexander.com/static/img/posts/gpsart_marryme.jpg" alt="">
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>You can check out more of his work at <a href="http://gpsdrawing.info/">http://gpsdrawing.info/</a>.</p>

<p>But anyway, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So I guess I just go 
put my running shoes on and take a bunch of those single steps for now.</p>

						<p>Why do psychiatric conditions exist?</p>
<p>This question is both unsatisfyingly unanswered and incredibly important. Here we will consider some features of the over-century-long failure of psychiatry to explain mental disorders, before reviewing a theoretical framework which promises to explain these conditions in a way which is not only scientifically sound, but emancipating. The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is a practice with more than a chequered past, perpetrating horrors even in living memory: Sprees of lobotomising adults and children; purposefully inducing comas in schizophrenics, producing thrashing, spasming and salivating so bad that one psychiatrist reported the scene on a ward as alike to artist Gustave Dore’s depictions of hell; and the widespread demonisation of homosexuality justifying the electrocution and injection of homosexuals with nauseating drugs during slideshows of sexually attractive individuals of the same sex, hoping to train them into being sick at their own sexuality.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the decades have come more from the dismissal of old and harmful practices than the inception of new ones. As electrocution and nauseation were slowly recognised as both immoral and ineffective, we are now left with psychotherapies and pharmaceuticals of unreliable and underwhelming efficacy. Tens of billions of dollars and several decades of research have led to few new discoveries. Many drug developers have now left psychiatry for more easily understood and chemically pliable conditions of the body rather than the mind. Leaders in national mental health research have expressed dismay that so little progress has been made. Some research suggests that the burden of psychiatric illness might even be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.13083">worsening</a>, not lessening.</p>
<p>Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviourism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence">chemical imbalance theories</a> were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">long dismissed</a> in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227">a discipline in crisis</a>, surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorising.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his first edition of <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859, Charles Darwin prophesied: “In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”</p>
<p>Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.</p>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is the metatheory of biology, linking all species and all biological forms. The process of constant biological variation, reproduction and selection between forms leads to evolution of populations, explaining the form of our bodies and minds. Therefore, the logic of evolutionary medicine and psychiatry goes, evolutionary theory should also be referred to in explaining why our bodies and minds are vulnerable to disorder and disease. All biology is evolutionary, and psychiatry is biological, hence psychiatry should be understood in evolutionary terms. The lack of progress in understanding psychiatric disorders makes sense in this light, because mainstream psychiatry has been ignoring the key theory in biology.</p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles of evolutionary psychiatry have been defined, and important works <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-Bad-Feelings-Evolutionary-ebook/dp/B078VXFZCX">published</a>, there does not yet exist a dedicated evolutionary psychiatry university department or journal. In 2016, the first noteworthy institutional group dedicated to evolutionary psychiatry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046779/">was formed</a>, in the Evolutionary Psychiatry Special Interest Group (EPSIG) at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This slow start and long build up does not dissuade evolutionary psychiatrists from believing that, in the ever-less-distant future, this theoretical paradigm will be recognised as the way to truly start explaining mental disorder.</p>
<p>A unique advantage of evolutionary psychiatry is its ability to define disease and disorder upon an evolutionary concept of dysfunction. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), defines mental disorder as dysfunction, but then fails to specify what that means. This allows transparently unscientific activities. Most famously, in 1973, after gay rights protestors had stormed an APA meeting, psychiatrists had donned anonymising hoods and professed their personal homosexuality to a group of their fellows, and national progressive values became a little too loud to ignore, the APA called a vote to reconsider homosexuality’s status as a mental disorder. By a 58% majority, it was struck off.</p>
<p>Voting to decide whether a condition is a disease is not the sign of a mature science, yet to this day consensus alone is the deciding factor of whether a mind is deemed disorderly. Commonly prescribed disorder labels in use today, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, included in the DSM-III because of the vote of a dozen or so psychiatrists, have criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650639/">based primarily upon</a> single review papers with poor empirical evidence from the 1970’s – even the authors of that paper expected it to be backed up with further evidence before becoming part of canon. In the most recent edition, the DSM-5, ‘internet gaming disorder’ was suggested, justified by comparing online (but specifically excluding offline) gaming to drug and gambling addictions. An international consortium has since <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.12457">voted</a> clarifying its features. Evolutionary psychiatry can thankfully supersede this ambiguous line between order and disorder.</p>
<p>Unlike physics and chemistry, which describe things simply as they are, biological processes can be meaningfully considered to function or dysfunction. Biological traits evolved to increase reproductive success – that is their function. Eyes evolved to see, so eyes which cannot see are dysfunctional. Psychological and physical traits functioned to provide reproductive success to our ancestors, and where that function fails or is interrupted, there is dysfunction. Mental disorders can then be defined as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych242">harmful dysfunctions</a> of the mind.</p>
<p>This analysis of function is inevitably historical (it concerns ancestral evolutionary function, not modern functioning) and so is difficult to ascertain in many cases, especially in psychology, and is complicated by the possibility of random processes of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>. Nevertheless, this reference to evolutionary function is the <i>only</i> way to define function by an objective biological process rather than relying solely on subjective norms and cultural values – or indeed a vote.</p>
<p>This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">six reasons</a> why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.</li>
<li>Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.</li>
<li>Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.</li>
<li>Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.</li>
<li>Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.</li>
<li>Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.</p>
<p>Work in evolutionary psychiatry has considered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051086/">depression</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/1/5229271">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/hunters-in-a-farmers-world-adhd-and-hunter-gatherers-2332-0915-1000150.pdf">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16005572/">OCD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9875960/">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">substance use disorders</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674370304800107">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603205_In_cold_blood_The_evolution_of_psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, and many more disorders through the evolutionary framework. Several can be explained as mental tendencies related to adaptations which were advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors.</p>
<p>For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">Alcoholism and drug abuse</a> manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/">obesity</a> by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/">gambling addiction</a> is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavours.</p>

<p>After years of using LibreOffice, I’ve now switched over to ONLYOFFICE and recommend it over any other office suite on Linux. Now I know a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> enthusiasts will be unhappy about the idealistic part of the recommendation, but hear me out.</p>



<h2><strong>Top notch Microsoft Office compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>I’m a<a href="https://jatan.space/"> science writer</a> who uses Linux because it just functions better for me than Windows or macOS and because I’m an open source enthusiast. Given my profession, I have to frequently collaborate with people on other operating systems who almost always use either Microsoft Office or Google Docs. After three years of trying, I can tell you that LibreOffice just doesn’t cut it. Either me or the other person will lose some formatting in the documents at some point. And as a document travels from one computer to another, things quickly become a mess.</p>



<p>That is when I found ONLYOFFICE. In over a year of using it, I’ve sent ONLYOFFICE created documents, spreadsheets and presentations to people using Microsoft Office, iWork, smartphone editors, Google Docs, etc., did multiple to and fro edits and it hasn’t broken <em>a single thing</em>! This is something I cannot ignore as a writer and my experience attests to ONLYOFFICE’s claim of top notch Microsoft Office compatibility.</p>



<h2><strong>More features</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond the excellent compatibility with Microsoft Office files, there are other features that make ONLYOFFICE a better alternative to LibreOffice, WPS or any other Linux office suite that I’ve used.</p>



<ul><li>All documents open in the same window as multiple tabs and you can manipulate them just like you’d in a browser. This is amazing.</li><li>Can connect to Nextcloud or OwnCloud for online and collaborative features like Google Docs.</li><li>Unlike LibreOffice, ONLYOFFICE has adequately functional and maintained mobile &amp; tablet apps on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onlyoffice.documents">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onlyoffice-documents/id944896972">iOS</a>.</li><li>Has Ribbon UI, so in my opinion things are easier to find on ONLYOFFICE compared to LibreOffice’s <strong>“Default”</strong> UI.</li><li>Open source, making it more trustworthy than WPS Office and other proprietary solutions on Linux.</li><li>Available on Windows and macOS too if you don’t want to use Microsoft Office or simply can’t afford its licensing fee.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Go get it</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200" alt="" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=400 400w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></figure></div>



<p>ONLYOFFICE is officially available to <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-desktop.aspx">download</a> on Linux as a Deb, RPM, Flatpak and a Snap package so you can use it on any Linux distro you like!</p>



<p>I hope I’ve convinced you to give ONLYOFFICE a shot and see if it solves your problems. If it doesn’t, you can file bugs and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors">their GitHub repository</a>. In my experience, they’ve been very open to feature suggestions and prompt on bug fixes.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>My ideals for FOSS dwindled swiftly when I had to make something work in the real world. Not everyone can use everything truly FOSS all the time. At least ONLYOFFICE is open source (<a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors/blob/master/LICENSE">AGPL-3.0, specifically</a>) and not proprietary like Microsoft Office. Bottomline, ONLYOFFICE is a fantastic office suite that I hope more people discover.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>(Updated 2020-09-06 with pointers to related work and a bit more explanation)</p>

<p>This is a bit of a followup to <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/personal/2018/05/10/toward-gpu-json-parsing.html">Towards GPGPU JSON parsing</a>. That proposed a rather roundabout way to parallelize a simple parsing task. Having had more GPU programming experience under my belt, I don’t expect that particular approach to work well, but it did suggest that parallelism exists in the problem.</p>

<p>This post is a writeup of a new idea, but with a caution, no implementation. It probably contains some mistakes, and maybe the idea is flawed. But if it holds up, I think it’s an exciting line of research on how to port sequential algorithms to GPU.</p>

<p>For this post, I’m going to pose an even more simplified version of the problem: for each open bracket, record the index of the parent in the parse tree, and for each close bracket, the index of the corresponding open bracket.</p>

<p>This is a simple sequential program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>stack</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>None</span><span>]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>token</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span><span>:</span>
        <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>stack</span><span>[</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>stack</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>'['</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>']'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To follow the running example from the JSON post, assume the input <code>[[][[][][[]]][][]]</code>. The result is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>index 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
input [  [  ]  [  [  ]  [  ]  [  [  ]  ]  ]  [  ]  [  ]  ]
value -  0  1  0  3  4  3  6  3  8  9  8  3  0 13  0 15  0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can it be parallelized? It’s challenging to see how, as there are dependencies on previous state. Further, the state itself has unbounded size. It can be O(n); a pathological case is a million open brackets followed by a million close. In practice, depending on the workloads, we might expect more modest nesting depth, but ideally we’d like an algorithm that can handle all cases at least reasonably well.</p>

<p>Maybe we can do something. To longtime readers of my blog (and the “rope science” series before that), it will be no surprise I’ll try to use monoids.</p>

<p>So let’s turn this sequential program into a monoid. If I had a time portal, I’d lens forward in time and use the handy automated tool that some enterprising PhD student will has done by then. But, failing that, I’ll do it in my head.</p>

<p>The monoid is basically a sequence of pops followed by a sequence of pushes. Since the pop operations (in this case) don’t have a payload, they can be represented simply as a count. So the monoid is the pair <code>(n_pops, elements)</code>. The primitive for push is <code>(0, [element])</code>, and for pop it’s <code>(1, [])</code>. The monoid operation is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>combine</span><span>(</span><span>m1</span><span>,</span> <span>m2</span><span>):</span>
    <span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>s1</span> <span>=</span> <span>m1</span>
    <span>n2</span><span>,</span> <span>s2</span> <span>=</span> <span>m2</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>n2</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span> <span>+</span> <span>n2</span> <span>-</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>),</span> <span>s2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>s1</span><span>[:</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>n2</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>s2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And of course, the identity element is <code>(0, [])</code>. One intuition for this monoid is that it represents a function from the state at the beginning of a sequence of tokens to the state at the end. If it indeed computes this function for arbitrary subsequences, then it it follows that it’s a monoid from the fact that function composition is associative.</p>

<p>Running scan, or generalized <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2020/04/30/prefix-sum.html">prefix sum</a>, on this monoid, will result in the desired result at the top of the stack, i.e. the last element of the sequence in the monoid.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that this monoid is associative.</p>

<p>I do believe that an automated tool for translating these kinds of simple sequential programs is possible, and that there’s a theory behind it that illuminates ways in which monoids do and do not compose. Some composition is possible, for example you could fairly easily extend this idea so that each child knows its sequence number relative to its siblings. To do that, blend in the “counting monoid,” which is just integer addition.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Extend the monoid to handle sequence numbers.</p>

<p>If we had a bound on stack depth, we’d be pretty well set. The problem is the unbounded case. My original thinking was to have a window of (let’s say size k) elements, and each pass would handle a slice of the stack of size k. I think this can be made to work, but at heart it requires a number of passes proportional to stack depth, so in the worst case O(n^2).</p>

<p>My new idea is to retain the single pass scan, but use a purpose-built data structure to represent the stack. At the top is a window of k elements, then after that is a linked list (or perhaps a linked list of chunks; honestly I haven’t worked through all the implications, much less actually implemented and done performance measurement).</p>

<p>The combine operation tries to fit the new combined sequence in the window (up to a shared link, which it can just retain). But if it overflows, then it must allocate, most likely using an atomic bump allocator into global memory, as is often done in piet-gpu.</p>

<h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance analysis</h2>

<p>To do a <em>real</em> performance analysis would require an implementation, but it should be possible to reason about it a bit.</p>

<p>Clearly performance will be excellent if stack depth is shallow. The rate at which the linked list will be invoked will depend on the workload, and also the parallelism patterns. It’s worth noting that if the scan is run sequentially, then the linked list operations will always be cheap. This is because the concatenation at the heart of the monoid operation is <em>asymmetrical</em> when using a linked list - a large sequence on the left is cheap when the sequence on the right is small, but not the other way around. When running the scan purely sequentially, the monoid on the right is always of size 1 at most.</p>

<p>And the decoupled lookback implementation of scan, which is state of the art, runs essentially sequentially at large granularity; it just tries to exploit as much parallelism as the hardware provides at smaller granularity. Even with extremly deep nesting, it should build and retain a linked list of the stack as it scans, with a relatively smaller window for the part of the problem currently in flight.</p>

<p>There is another reason to be optimistic about performance. While the bandwidth of communication between partitions scales with the window size, that’s not necessarily true for processing <em>within</em> a partition. Putting aside for a moment the relatively challenging problem of implementing an efficient GPU kernel (which by necessity would exploit SIMD parallelism), consider a decoupled look-back implementation running on a more traditional multicore CPU, where each thread is sequential.</p>

<p>Basically, the first pass runs the traditional, sequential stack algorithm, with the modification that some of the input stack might not be available. At the end is the monoid, with “n_pops” being a count of the number of times that happened, and the sequence containing all the elements pushed inside that partition.</p>

<p>In the decoupled lookback phase, this monoid is published for consumption of partitions to the right, and the partition also computes the aggregate from partitions to the left. The cost of the monoid operations in this phase <em>will</em> be proportional to the size of the window, but keep in mind that the number of aggregates is orders of magnitude less than the number of elements.</p>

<p>Finally, in the second pass over the elements, the stack algorithm is run again, and this time elements that were missing in the first pass are available, from the aggregate obtained during the decoupled lookback phase. As another potential optimization, the second pass might “jump over” subtrees that were computed entirely locally within the partition in the first pass, only doing work on subtrees that cross partition boundaries.</p>

<p>Thus, my analysis is that the work factor is <em>extremely</em> good for this algorithm, meaning that on a 64 core processor, it might come within striking distance of 64 times faster than a single core sequential implementation (obviously modulo all the usual other factors that make this challenging).</p>

<p>As I mentioned, an efficient GPU kernel is likely to be challenging, probably requiring tricky techniques to exploit SIMD (warp) parallelism without spending too much time computing the monoid composition, but the fact that it seems to work so well in the multicore case is an encouraging sign that an efficient, fully GPU-tuned implementation is possible.</p>



<p>In an earlier draft, I asked for relevant literature related to this idea. I still haven’t found anything that presents this particular monoid, or a tool that can derive it from its sequential source, but there is a fair amount of related work.</p>

<p>Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is an important exploration of deriving more parallelism from the JSON parsing task, with impressive results. It is, I think, complementary to this exploration, as it exploits parallelism at a fine grain, where this monoid approach is geared towards the larger grain of tree structure. But both are necessary for a performant GPU implementation; anyone intending to really parse JSON on GPU is well advised to study it.</p>

<p>Parsing CSV has some of the same problems as JSON, though not the (potentially deeply) nested tree structure. A recent preprint, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13415.pdf">ParPaRaw: Massively Parallel Parsing of Delimiter-Separated Raw Data</a> presents a GPU implementation.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/1512">PR to cudf</a> implements “JSON Lines” parsing, which seems to me more similar to CSV than full tree-structured JSON parsing, but I haven’t dug into it in detail.</p>

<p>There is also a large literature on incremental parsing, which is related to parallel parsing as well (monoids are useful to both); a relevant example is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/efficient-parallel-and-incremental-parsing-of-practical-contextfree-languages/4D620F0BFADE2B588F854AAAEA252F5C">Efficient parallel and incremental parsing of practical context-free languages</a>.</p>

<p>I linked it in my previous blog, but <a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/24749">Aaron Hsu’s PhD thesis</a> is a remarkable full compiler implementation (for an APL-derived language) on GPU. It <em>does</em> address tree structure, and I believe generally uses adjacency matrices to represent that.</p>

<p>An interesting paper on converting a sequential program into a monoid is <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3018882.3018891">Functional Parallels of Sequential Imperatives</a>, and that has a lot of pointers into other literature. I haven’t (yet) read it carefully enough to know whether it could derive the monoid stated above. …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

</p>

<p>This article took me four weeks to finish. During this time, I’ve had ideas for more than ten articles, started writing them in parallel, delaying this one so much that I almost gave up ever publishing it… It wasn’t until I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention-ebook/dp/B005GFII62">Driven To Distraction</a> that I stumbled upon an explanation for why I was struggling to finish. Through this book and my doctor, I’ve discovered that I have a condition called Adult ADHD.</p>

<p>While the adult variant of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Adult_ADHD_Diagnostic_Expansion">recently</a> started to become a serious subject of research, it’s difficult to find testimonies about it related to work, in particular entrepreneurship. Early results show that there’s a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-018-0061-1">positive correlation between ADHD and the desire and act to start a company</a>. I’ll share how adult ADHD can affect a founder’s experience and how it played a role in the successes and stumbles of my life as the cofounder and CTO of <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backstory-and-the-entrepreneurship-drive">Backstory and the entrepreneurship drive</h2>

<p>From an early age, I had trouble remembering important things like my birthday (learned around age 7), how to tie shoes (learned age 12), or even why I entered a room in the first place (to this day, this keeps happening). All the way to the end of high school, getting good grades was easy. However, early signs of difficulty focusing popped up here and there: even when required to, I wasn’t able to sit down and learn. For example, in France, students must memorize entire poems, then are expected to recite it back the next day. As hard as I tried, when I stepped in front of the class my mind remained blank, unable to recall the words I had tried to learn the day before. The teacher, exasperated by my silence, called me “lazy” and “rebellious.”</p>

<p>After high school, I was accepted into the best schools in France. Difficulties focusing on homework became more problematic as advanced maths, physics, and chemistry required deeper focus and concentration to understand complex topics. My grades were now in the middle of the class instead of being at the top. For the first time, I started to feel the deep frustration of not being able to focus when I needed it.</p>

<p>As I started my professional life, things became more interesting. I was hired as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn and finally, it was an environment where my creativity could be unleashed. I suffered from “too-many-project-itis”, a made-up condition for engineers who start too many projects and finish too few. I learned to let go of most of them while focusing on the ones that would yield tangible results. Eventually, one of these ideas, a place to get verified information about people, motivated me enough to want to stop working at a big company and create a company that became a real startup: <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<p>The pressure of long hours and stress to find product-market fit during early startup days pushed my mind to new highs and lows. What I thought were quirks of my personality quickly became signs that something in my brain was different than my peers. These inherent differences, while frustrating at times, also led to surprising successes for our business. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878">Adult ADHD symptoms</a> fall into three categories as they relate to an entrepreneur’s experiences:  the <em>Good</em>, the <em>Bad</em>, and the <em>Ugly</em>. Just like in the famous scene they will, throughout your life, face each other or even duel at times: it’s your responsibility to have the “Good” win.</p>

<p>
   <img alt="Scene from the good, the bad and the ugly" src="https://www.kabdebon.com/assets/images/posts/2020-08-25-creative-mayhem-life-as-founder-with-adhd/thegoodthebadtheugly.jpg">
</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>“The bad” are the parts of ADHD that are not pleasant to deal with, for you or others. These behaviors, if not dealt with, will be a challenge to your success as an entrepreneur.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anxiety</strong>. <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.4.716?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;">Research shows that close to one in two people with ADHD suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder</a>. As with most ADHD symptoms, it’s hard to predict how anxiety will show up in your life. For me, it’s heightened stress during unexpected events, like the departure of a key employee or a serious bug in the code. In these moments, I need to remind myself that it’s OK and surround myself with people who can keep their heads on their shoulders. 
In fact, to cope with anxiety, I’ve built a comprehensive incident management system that we use daily at Truework. Research has a name for it: <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/10/three-leadership-skills-that-c">productive paranoia</a>, an attribute that distinguishes companies that thrive in chaos instead of suffering from it. Anxiety is rarely talked about in entrepreneurship stories, but in my experience is very common. If channeled constructively, it’ll help build defense mechanisms for when bad news strikes. Remember, the journey to build a business is a rocky one and it’ll certainly trigger intense moments of anxiety and doubts.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of filter</strong>. “insensitive”, “harsh”, “direct”: if you have ADHD, you’ve probably heard these comments about your behavior. For founders, the difference between a successful outcome and a disastrous one often lies in how carefully you choose your words. Over time I’ve trained myself to consciously think before speaking: no more “thinking out loud” in front of my reports. You may need to reach into the depths of your willpower to stop yourself from blurting words that may get you in trouble, but trust me, it’s worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>

<p>“The ugly” parts are the frustrations of daily life. They’ll make you feel a bit “different” from others or “off”.  I’ve found they have little impact on my journey as a founder but instead can bring your enthusiasm and confidence down. Keeping them under control will improve your overall well being as a person which is very important for founders.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem of focus</strong>. This is the first thing people think about when they think ADHD, and with good reason. It’s difficult to describe to a non-ADHD person how quickly the ADHD brain gets distracted. For me, any notification will stop me from writing an important article or work on an important task. For founders, tasks calling for your attention and interruptions will grow exponentially with the size of the company. While disturbing to most people, it can be absolutely overwhelming for people with adult ADHD. Keep it simple: turn off all notifications or go back to pen and paper when deep focus is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Time management</strong>. Being at a meeting on time, being ready for the meeting, planning in advance. These tasks are not easy for a person with ADHD. Before most deadlines, I seem to remember to do everything but the task I’m supposed to do. Time management is a crucial skill for founders and soon after you start your company your calendar will fill with dozens of meetings and other obligations per week. I’ve found it’s best to hire and rely early on somebody that can help you with organization. Alternatively, reminders, TODO lists, and other software can help you stay on top of tasks and meetings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>Finally with the “the good” parts. Let me preface this part by saying that the qualities listed below are not superpowers. But they may give you an edge in specific situations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deep Focus</strong>. It appears to contradict the part above about the lack of focus, but people with ADHD <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus#ADHD">report having an ability to deeply focus on topics they are passionate about</a>. Currently, I’m reading everything I can get my hands on about the topic of documentation, in particular knowledge organization. I often lose track of time after sitting down with a compelling article and forget to eat a meal As founders start their journeys, they face incredible challenges: only the passion for their work will allow them to continue and overcome obstacles. Founders who are able to channel that “hyperfocus” towards the company’s future will leapfrog their competitors and be the engine that drives their company’s vision forward.</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity</strong>. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-creativity-of-adhd/">Research</a> points out that adults with ADHD show a higher level of creativity compared to other people. It’s been my observation that it has been easier for me to think “outside the box” when faced with a difficult problem than a lot of my peers. For founders, this is an advantage that they need to nurture in themselves, as success for a startup lies in doing things in a way that wasn’t thought possible before.</li>
  <li><strong>Impulsivity/Gut Feeling</strong>. The lack of filter which sometimes negatively impacts personal and professional relationships has a positive aspect as well. The life of a founder is punctuated by moments when it’s necessary to make an important decision with only partial information. It’s crucial to get over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">“analysis paralysis”</a> and trust your instinct. When hiring the first few people who will come to define your company, you’ll need to make a decision of who to bring on board. Trust your gut and go with the people that you think will make you successful.</li>
  <li><strong>Appetite for risk</strong>. Last but not least a rarely discussed aspect of adult ADHD is an above-average appetite for risk. This characteristic is of course essential to even start a business as a founder where nothing is for certain. As you grow, that “risk mindset” will be crucial to keep the company from playing it too safe after finding some initial success. For founders, pushing the boundaries is a requirement to survive as you grow.</li>
</ul>

<p>ADHD traits, described by the media, seem largely dysfunctional. While there’s some truth to it, they affect a founder’s life in contradictory ways: one day you’ll be extremely anxious and wondering why you took the leap in the first place, and the next you’ll be riding high, loving the risk of being an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>It’s too easy to let yourself be defined by the conditions you are born with and see them as roadblocks to your success. With most things in life you don’t get to choose what you’re born with, only what actions you take: if you want to become a founder, ADHD is just one of the problems you’ll need to solve along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/under_construction/">Under Construction</a></em> Friday, September 04, 2020 </p></div><div>

<p>I haven't said anything about Big Sur yet, and since the public beta has  been out for a while, and I'm getting more questions about it, it's time.</p>

<p>At present, it's <strong>not possible</strong> to make bootable copies of Big Sur, even with <code>asr</code>, Apple's own built-in replication utility. As such, we haven't released a Beta, or even an internal Alpha, because it wouldn't meet our own requirements.</p>

<p>So, for the moment, we're holding back, hoping that Apple will fix the issues and allow 3rd party (or even 1st party, given <code>asr</code>) bootable backups. While <code>asr</code> was failing completely in previous builds, in the most recent one it isn't able to back up because the system volume isn't properly 'sealed' (which is ominous, since why wouldn't a standard install be sealed, and if it's not, why wouldn't you be able to back it up anyway).</p>

<p>So, while progress is being made, we're kind of stuck waiting for the king.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my advice for macOS Betas remains as valid as ever: <strong>do not install a macOS Beta</strong> unless you have a <strong>critical business need</strong> to do so. These Betas, even when public, are not for general use, and certainly not for anyone who wants a reliable system for day-to-day work.</p>

<p>If you <strong>must</strong> install it, use Time Machine for backups for now (and, given my advice in <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/practices_make_perfect_backups/">Practices Make Perfect (Backups)</a>, on a continuing basis in addition to other methods), since it's  at a relatively equivalent Beta quality level to the OS itself and is explicitly tested and supported by Apple.</p>

<p>I'll be back when we have additional news to share. For those in the US, enjoy Labor Day weekend!</p>

September 5, 2020 | https://rillabs.com/posts/crystal-concurrency-with-easier-syntax-than-go | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rillabs.com/posts/crystal-concurrency-with-easier-syntax-than-go">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been playing around a lot with concurrency in Go over the years, resulting in libraries such as <a href="https://scipipe.org/" target="_blank">SciPipe</a>, <a href="http://flowbase.org/" target="_blank">FlowBase</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rdfio/rdf2smw/" target="_blank">rdf2smw</a>. My main motivation for looking into Go has been the possibility to use it as a more performant, scaleable and type-safe alternative to Python for data heavy scripting tasks in bioinformatics and other fields I've been dabbling in. Especially as it makes it so easy to write concurrent and parallel code in it. Be warned that this context is surely giving me some biases.</p>

<p>I find the concurrency features of Go - with its lightweight goroutines and channels - to be hard to beat in that it also provides true parallelism by mapping the goroutines onto physical operating system threads automatically in the background. Few if any other mainstream languages does that. It lifts off a lot of concerns that you as a developer don't need to deal with.</p>

<p>Still, the Go syntax has always felt rather complex. After 5+ years, I have still not learned how to open up a file and reading from it line by line, and need to check up the syntax on a site like <a href="https://gobyexample.com/" target="_blank">gobyexample.com</a>. This task also requires importing two different libraries (os, and bufio), which you have to remember.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://rillabs.com/site/assets/files/1111/selection_161.120x0-is.png" width="120">With this background, I found it interesting when a new language on the block, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2019/09/06/parallelism-in-crystal.html">touts to provide the same concurrency features</a>, still in a language with static typing and ahead-of-time compiling, with a much more scriptlike and clean syntax.</p>

<p>In this post, I take a brief look at Crystal by implementing a pattern I have been using a lot in Go: A simple pipeline, where one go-routine does something like read from a file, feeding of the data to another goroutine over a channel to do more work. I this post I will do this by implementing an extremely simple pipeline that does just that, in both of the languages, and then do some observations about the differences between the languages. In more concrete terms, what the program does is: let one go-routine read from a file line by line, and another one calculate the frequency of G and C:s over all of A, T, G, Cs in a DNA-file in the FASTA format.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-67/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa.gz">the (68MB) file I'm using here</a>.</p>

<p>You can find both of the below code files <a href="https://github.com/samuell/experiments/tree/master/govscr" target="_blank">on GitHub here</a>.</p>

<h3>Go implementation</h3>

<p>Here is the Go implementation:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	lineChan := make(chan string, 16)

	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Loop over the input file in a separate fiber
	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	go func() {
		defer close(lineChan)

		gcFile, err := os.Open("Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa")
		defer gcFile.Close()
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		scan := bufio.NewScanner(gcFile)
		for scan.Scan() {
			line := scan.Text()
			lineChan &lt;- line
		}
	}()

	at := 0
	gc := 0

	for line := range lineChan {
		if line[0] == '&gt;' {
			continue
		}

		for _, chr := range line {
			switch chr {
			case 'A', 'T':
				at += 1
				continue
			case 'G', 'C':
				gc += 1
				continue
			}
		}
	}

	var gcFrac float64
	gcFrac = float64(gc) / float64(at+gc)
	fmt.Printf("GC fraction: %f\n", gcFrac)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compile and run with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>GOMAXPROCS=4; go build -o gcgo gc.go
./gcgo</code></pre>

<h3>Crystal implementation</h3>

<p>... and here is the same functionality, implemented in Crystal:</p>

<pre><code>lines_chan = Channel(String).new(16)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the input file in a separate fiber (and thread, if you set the
# CRYSTAL_WORKERS count to something larger than 1), and send its output on a
# channel
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
spawn do
  gcfile = File.new("Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa")                                      
  gcfile.each_line() do |line|                                                                            
    lines_chan.send(line)                                                                                 
  end                                                                                                     
  gcfile.close 
ensure  
  lines_chan.close
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the lines on the channel in the main thread, and count GC fraction.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at = 0
gc = 0
while line = lines_chan.receive?
  if line.starts_with?('&gt;')
    next
  end
  line.each_byte() do |chr|
    case chr
    when 'A', 'T'
      at += 1
      next
    when 'G', 'C'
      gc += 1
      next
    end
  end
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output results
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gcfrac = gc / (gc + at)
puts "GC fraction: #{gcfrac}"
</code></pre>



<p>Note that to run the Crystal program with true multi-threading, you have to send a flag: -Dpreview_mt, to use it.</p>

<p>Compile and run with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>CRYSTAL_WORKERS=4; crystal build --release -Dpreview_mt -o gccr gc.cr
./gccr

</code></pre>

<h3>Some differences</h3>

<p>We can note a few differences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Crystal code is considerably shorter.</li>
	<li>I find the Crystal code easier to read.</li>
	<li>Crystal does not need to create a main()-function, but can include code directly in the file, similar to Python and Ruby.</li>
	<li>In Crystal you don't need to import multiple packages to open a file, and to loop over it.</li>
	<li>In Crystal, as seen in the code, we use "<a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/exception_handling.html#ensure" target="_blank">ensure</a>", between any two "begin/end" clauses, in a similar way as Go:s "defer", to ensure something is done as the very last thing before existing the function.</li>
	<li>In my tests, the Go implementation has always outperformed the Crystal one, so far. This might change with time of course.</li>
	<li>Truly static binary deployments seem to not be fully supported in Crystal just yet (see <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">Issue #9285</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think it is a bit early to draw to hard conclusions between the two langauges, as Crystal is so new, and this is just a very first test by me. But I find it interesting to have two languages with a similar set of concurrency primitives, to be able to compare various factors, as well as approaches taken.</p>

<p>Crystal looks like a promising alternative to Go, for concurrency use cases which allows writing in a much more script-like syntax. This could potentially make it a really interesting language for scientific fields such as bioinformatics, something that bioinformatics luminary <a href="https://twitter.com/lh3lh3" target="_blank">Heng Li</a> <a href="https://lh3.github.io/2020/05/17/fast-high-level-programming-languages" target="_blank">has been blogging about</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">pointed out a problematic area for deployment</a>, currently).</p>

<p>I'm still worried about whether Crystal will manage to provide the same level of extremely portable, statically linked binaries though (EDIT: <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2020/02/02/alpine-based-docker-images.html" target="_blank">there's a workaround, using alpine linux</a>), and this might turn out to be a real dealbreaker. Also, with the upcoming generics implementation in Go, some of the complexities of Go might be possible to hide away for end-users of some libraries, by providing high-level abstractions over typical complex tasks. One can of course also wonder if Crystal will be able to reach the level of popularity and size of ecosystem as Go, without a large industry backer (maybe if they can leverage the large number of Ruby-developers looking for a new compiled, fast language?).</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what happens, as Crystal gets closer to 1.0, and Go soon gets generics into the language. What can be said for sure, is that we will soon have more options, for writing concurrent, performant code.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

      <p>Long-time readers will know that I’m <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/05/18/rss-nothing-better/">a big fan of RSS feeds</a>. An RSS reader has been essential to my web experience since I first came online, and I’ve doggedly stuck to using them even as the web has centralised onto a few platforms and much digital ink spilt about the “death of RSS”. Luckily, I’m not the only one who prefers this old-school, human-curated approach to the web over today’s platforms and their algorithms.</p>
<p><a href="https://fraidyc.at/">Fraidycat</a> is a browser extension for following people on the web, created by someone named Kicks Condor, whose <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/">main internet presence</a> as of this writing appears to an elaborate act of performance art. Previously it was a blog, and maybe it will be one again, who can say?</p>
<p>Like a latter day <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/09/23/review-whys-poignant-guide-to-ruby/">_why</a>, Kicks combines clever programming with a colourful and quirky aesthetic to create software that is both useful and a little odd, hence the name and colourscheme.</p>

<p>Fraidycat differs from traditional RSS readers (ala the late Google Reader) in two key ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. It’s not just an RSS reader</strong>. In addition to RSS (and Atom, and JSON) feeds, you can use Fraidycat to follow Twitter and Instagram accounts, Youtube channels, TiddlyWikis, <a href="https://davidyat.es/2019/06/24/indieweb/">indieweb</a> h-feeds and <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat#follow-support">a whole bunch more</a>. The explicit goal of the project is provide a universal interface for following people regardless of the platforms they use.</p>
<p>Although I don’t share the author’s complete aversion to using social media sites, I find Fraidycat very useful for following a few high signal-to-noise accounts on various platforms, so I can make sure I see everything they post.</p>
<p><strong>2. It doesn’t look like an email client.</strong> Most feed readers carefully track and even save each post from each of your subscriptions. Posts are marked as read or unread, and, where possible, the full body text of each post is embedded in the reader’s interface. Fraidycat doesn’t even try to do either of these things. No distinction is made between read and unread items (beyond your browser’s visited/unvisited link colouration), and no tally is kept. No interface exists for reading post content. Every site/account you subscribe to is shown with links to its ten most recent posts. Clicking a link takes you to the post in question, and if you want to see the eleventh most recent post, well, you can go to the site itself.</p>
<p>These feature omissions are my favourite things about Fraidycat. I follow a lot of different sites for a lot of different reasons. With some, I want to read every post. With others, I just want to see the latest headlines and dip into when one catches my eye. Every RSS reader I’ve used in the past has irritated me by running up unread counts for the latter category.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my post about <a href="https://davidyat.es/2020/03/14/reader-modes/">browser reader modes</a>, I usually prefer to read articles on their original websites – partly so that they don’t all blend together like Medium sludge, and partly because syndicated content has an uncomfortably high probability of losing formatting and even chunks of text. So Fraidycat’s philosophy of linking rather than rendering is ideal for my usecase. The world could probably do with more developers who <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/wiki/Rejected-Features">intentionally leave out features</a>.</p>
<p>Fraidycat allows you to categorise your subscriptions on two levels: category and importance. Categories are up to you to define, and are shown as tabs at the top of the page. One subscription can appear in multiple categories. Kicks’s preferred aesthetic is to use emojis as category names, but you can use words too.</p>
<p>Importance is unique to Fraidycat, and provides a way for you to prioritise content and shape your reading habits. Each subscription can appear in one of the below importances:</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This allows you to determine how often you’ll want to check in on a given site/account/person, which is likely to be a function of how frequently they post, the lengths of their posts, and how interested you are in their content. A favourite Twitter account, for example, may be placed in Real-time, while a rarely updated blog, or one you seldom have time to read, may be placed in Sometimes, to be glanced at when you’re not doing anything else.</p>
<p>I wasn’t completely sold on this feature when I first started using Fraidycat, as I’d often forget to check the last two tabs, but that’s basically the point of having them – not everything needs to be checked for updates all the time. In any case, you can just put everything in Real-time or Frequent and never bother with time sensitivity if it doesn’t work for you.</p>
<p>Before switching to Fraidycat about a year ago, I used web-based RSS readers like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>. My main concern with switching was that my subscriptions would be tied to my main PC. Fortunately, the extension integrates with browser sync, so subscriptions will be synced between devices. This functionality didn’t exist the last time I tried using a browser extension feed reader, and its absence would have been a dealbreaker (and also a heartbreaker).</p>
<p>There’s currently no way to get Fraidycat on a smartphone, but I don’t need it there. Even the feeds I follow in real-time aren’t quite important enough that I need to check them when I’m not in front of a computer. Which, I think, is very much in keeping with the application’s philosophy. Fraidycat produces no notifications, applies no machine learning to your subscriptions to recommend content you might like, and doesn’t gamify your actions or track you. You choose who to follow and how to follow, and the app does nothing outside of that. Fraidycat is the best RSS reader I’ve ever used because of what it leaves out.</p>

<p>Permutation City is a great novel with a very interesting philosophical argument embedded inside it. Many people don’t want to read the whole novel, so here is my short explanation of Egan’s Dust Theory.</p>



<p>If you think experience is simulatable, you buy computational or “patternist” theories of identity, there are some very strange implications that are not commonly brought up. </p>



<p>Because computation is sort of subjective, just a set of relations that can be usefully interpreted as representing a function, this seems to imply that the function you identify with can be interpreted as being simulated by any sufficiently complex set of relations. </p>



<p>That is, for any random set of relations with enough complexity to represent a human mind, Egan claims, there exists an exotic encoding scheme that can interpret this set of relations as representing any arbitrary function, including the function that you would call “I”.</p>



<p>Now you cannot access this information usefully, so most functions can be said to not usefully exist within this randomness. But if you buy the whole “I think therefore I am” business this does not matter for those functions that are conscious, because consciousness is self-justifying. </p>



<p>So the function that is you is being “run” far more often in random noise than engineered computers or ‘real’ physical reality. This is sort of like the Boltzmann brain idea but even worse because it applies to any set of relations. According to Egan’s argument all possible experiences that can be computed by any sufficiently complex set of relations are in fact computed by them. </p>



<p>In fact, even if you imagine a static set of relations that do not evolve in time there still exists encoding schemes that can interpret this set of relations as any arbitrary function, so in some sense the set of mathematical objects that represent “you” and “me” and all possible minds can be said to exist in these timeless relations. </p>



<p>Egan discusses some counterarguments to the idea here: <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html">https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html</a></p>

September 5, 2020 | https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>



<pre>MOV rm&lt;-&gt;r     4  3
LEA            1  1
alu rm&lt;-&gt;r    32  4
alu rm,i       4  5

RET/RETF iw    4  4
JMP cw/JMP cb  2  6
JMP cd         1  7
Jcond         32  3
MOV rmw&lt;-&gt;sr   2  2
LES            1  4
LDS            1  4

SAHF           1  4
LAHF           1  2
ESC            8  1
XLAT           1  5
STOS           2  6 (discontinuous)
CMPS/SCAS      4 13 (discontinuous)
MOVS/LODS      4 11 (discontinuous)
JCXZ           1  5 (discontinuous)
LOOPNE/LOOPE   2  5
LOOP           1  4
DAA/DAS        2  4
AAA/AAS        2  8
AAD            1  4
AAM            1  6
INC/DEC rw    16  2
INT ib         1  2
INTO           1  4
INT 3          1  3</pre>



<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>



<pre>INC/DEC rm        3
PUSH rm           4
NOT rm            3
NEG rm            3
CALL FAR rm       8
CALL rm           8
TEST rm,i         4
JMP rm            2
JMP FAR rm        4
IMUL/MUL rmb      8
IMUL/MUL rmw      8
IDIV/DIV rmb      8
IDIV/DIV rmw      8</pre>



<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p>The article has been updated to accommodate changes since the original four months ago.</p></blockquote>



<p>Like everyone else, I got excited about the latest Ubuntu LTS release, 20.04, and installed it on day one. A month in, I’m sorry to say that I leave disappointed. The amount of unready <em>snap</em> features being effectively forced onto Ubuntu is affecting my usability and user-friendliness.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="409" height="230" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=409 409w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=300 300w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px"></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Software center can’t install Flatpak apps</strong></h2>



<p>In 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu’s Software Center was switched from being a .deb version of GNOME Software to a <em>snap</em> app. The new snapped store can handle management of <em>snap</em> applications and traditional .deb ones, but it can’t install or remove Flatpak applications, like the .deb version could.</p>



<p>Users wanting to install Flatpak apps <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/25/how-to-install-flatpak-apps-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts/">need to revert to using the .deb version</a>. It’s not an ideal solution when previous Ubuntu Software releases could handle all three formats. In all, the latest Ubuntu Software is a step back.</p>



<h2><strong>Browsing the Snap Store sucks</strong></h2>



<p>Good apps, and finding them, are central to the success of any modern operating system. Even without Flatpak apps, I was expecting the snapped store to at least do what it’s supposed to do well–help find apps. It turns out that instead Ubuntu prioritizes snap apps over .deb ones in store search results at any cost! So you’ll see a long list of non relevant entries of snap apps above .deb ones, even if your search term exactly matches the latter. -_-</p>



<p>Needless to say this is a serious issue for discovering software, especially for users switching from Windows or Mac. The snapped store isn’t just a step back, but is downright unreliable.</p>



<h2><strong>Slow and forced Chromium snap</strong></h2>



<p>On the latest Ubuntu, if you try to download the .deb version of Chromium using either the Software Store or the command line, it acts as an alias and installs the snap version! Essentially, Chromium snap is shoved down your throat even if you explicitly asked for the .deb version. This is not cool Ubuntu; Just because Chromium may be easier to maintain as a snap app doesn’t justify this forced behavior.</p>



<p>Besides, a typical user doesn’t care how the app is managed in the backend, all they care about is how it works. And that’s another place where snaps don’t shine. They are slow. I hate that Chromium’s snap takes more than 10 seconds to load on cold boot on a freaking SSD, whereas .deb and Flatpak apps load in 1-2 seconds. Snaps are simply not fast enough to be default <em>anything</em> yet.</p>



<h2><strong>No control over updates</strong></h2>



<p>Snap applications auto-update and that’s fine if Ubuntu wants to keep systems secure. But it can’t even be turned off manually. Auto-updating of snaps can only be deferred at best, until at some point, like Windows, it auto-updates anyway. Even on metered connections, snaps auto-update after a threshold time. This is unacceptable. Even Apple has easy options to disable automatic software updates.</p>



<p>Ubuntu’s update process with 20.04 LTS is a deal breaker for people on limited bandwidth connections or who want to know exactly what they’re updating and when they’d like to. Even at best, this behavior is causing me issues like slowing down my connection abruptly and using a major chunk of my limited data for the day. My <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/25?u=uncertainquark">discussion on the Ubuntu forums</a> on the topic and many such raised issues by others didn’t go well, read the <em>full thread</em> if interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Ubuntu was my first Linux-based operating system and is what attracted me to the ecosystem. I have a soft spot for it, especially the amazing Unity days. As such, it is disappointing to see this snap obsession that has taken over Ubuntu. An OS once lauded for its sane defaults and user friendliness is actively going against the user’s will.</p>



<p>What’s especially concerning is that this is the Ubuntu version that millions of people will use for at least two years. I don’t hate snaps but being forced to use it especially when in a clearly premature state is forcing me to hate it. Snaps simply aren’t ready for system-wide daily usage and Ubuntu should’ve known better. Perhaps Ubuntu should’ve created a separate snap-based OS image, like Fedora’s <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/">Silverblue</a>, and only swap the default when it’s ready.</p>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS’ snap obsession has snapped me off of it. I have switched to macOS as my daily driver, for many other reasons. I don’t have the time to keep fixing things on Linux Desktop and be constantly finding ways to work around standard OS features that should otherwise just be available and work.</p>



<p>For those on Linux, I recommend using <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS 20.04</a> instead of Ubuntu as it is basically Ubuntu but without the snap, and some unique features. <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> is what I use on my now secondary device, mainly because of its <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/">app ecosystem</a>, <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/03/21/why-i-love-elementary-os-file-manager/">excellent file manager</a> and the <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/04/my-contributions-to-elementary-os-and-how-you-can-too/">welcoming nature</a> of their developers for contributions and suggestions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Inflammatory proteins, also known as cytokines, play a crucial role in the immune response. If this immune response is too strong, a phenomenon known as “cytokine storm”, it can cause harm to the patient. It has been thought that a cytokine storm contributes to disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Following the measurement of several important cytokines in patients with COVID-19 and various other severe diseases, researchers at Radboud university medical center now show that COVID-19 is <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770484" target="_blank">not characterized by a cytokine storm</a>. This may have consequences for the treatment of these patients, the researchers write in JAMA.</em></p><p>
&nbsp;
The cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is not clearly defined. In many cases, different cytokines are evaluated and no comparison has been made with other diseases. Therefore, uncertainty and doubt exists concerning the cytokine storm in these patients.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Various patient groups</strong><br>
Researchers from the Intensive Care (IC) department at Radboud university medical center have now measured the concentration of three essential cytokines in the blood of patients admitted to the IC with several distinct conditions. They performed these measurements in patients with COVID-19 who met the criteria for a severe acute respiratory infection (ARDS), patients with bacterial septic shock (with and without ARDS), and patients who had been admitted to the IC after a cardiac arrest or severe trauma. The cytokines were measured using the same methods for each of the groups of patients.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Cytokine storm?</strong><br>
In the abovedescribed five patient groups, the concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)&nbsp;and interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8) was measured. The results were remarkable. Researcher Matthijs Kox: "The level of cytokines was significantly less elevated in COVID-19 patients than in patients with septic shock and ARDS. Compared to patients with septic shock without ARDS, so without severe pulmonary disease, patients with COVID-19 also displayed markedly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The cytokine concentrations in COVID-19 patients were similar to those in IC &nbsp;patients with trauma or cardiac arrest, conditions that are not noted for a cytokine storm."</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Possible consequences</strong><br>
The results from this study show that COVID-19 is not characterized by a cytokine storm. Professor of Intensive Care Medicine Peter Pickkers: "The severe disease observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients is therefore not explained by strongly elevated levels of inflammatory proteins in the blood. This means that critically ill COVID-19 patients likely will not benefit from specific anti-cytokine therapies."<br>

    <p>The programming world is moving towards functional programming (FP). More developers are using languages with an explicit bias towards FP, such as Scala and Haskell, while object-oriented (OO) languages and their communities adopt FP features and practices. (A striking example of the latter is the rise of Typescript and React in the Javascript community.) So what is FP and what does it mean to write code in a functional style? It’s common to view functional programming as a collection of language features, such as first class functions, or to define it as a programming style using immutable data and pure functions. (Pure functions always return the same output given the same input.) This was my view when I started down the FP route, but I now believe the true goals of FP are enabling local reasoning and composition. Language features and programming style are in service of these goals. In this post I attempt to explain the meaning and value of local reasoning and composition.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-is">What Functional Programming Is</h2>
<p>I believe that functional programming is a hypothesis about software quality: that software that can be understood before it is run and is built of small reusable components is easier to write and maintain. The first property is known as local reasoning, and the second as composition. Let’s address each in turn.</p>
<p>Local reasoning means we can understand pieces of code in isolation. When we see the expression <code>1 + 1</code> we know what it means regardless of the weather, the database, or the current status of our Kubernetes cluster. None of these external events can change it. This is a trivial and slightly silly example, but it illustrates a point. A goal of functional programming is to extend this ability across our code base.</p>
<p>It can help to understand local reasoning by looking at what it is not. Shared mutable state is out because relying on shared state means that other code can change what our code does without our knowledge. It means no global mutable configuration, as found in many web frameworks and graphics libraries for example, as any random code can change that configuration. Metaprogramming has to be carefully controlled. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>, for example, as again it allows other code to change our code in non-obvious ways. As we can see, adapting code to enable local reasoning can mean quite some sweeping changes. However if we work in a language that embraces functional programming this style of programming is the default.</p>
<p>Composition means building big things out of smaller things. Numbers are compositional. We can take any number and add one, giving us a new number. Lego is also compositional. We compose Lego by sticking it together. In the particular sense we’re using composition we also require the original elements we combine don’t change in any way when they are composed. When we create by <code>2</code> by adding <code>1</code> and <code>1</code> we get a new result but we don’t change what <code>1</code> means.</p>
<p>We can find compositional ways to model common programming tasks once we start looking for them. React components are one example familiar to many front-end developers: a component can consist of many components. HTTP routes can be modelled in a compositional way. A route is a function from an HTTP request to a handler function or a value indicating the route did not match. We can combine routes as a logical or: try this route or, if it doesn’t match, try this other route. Processing pipelines are another example that often use sequential composition: perform this pipeline stage and then this other pipeline stage.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Types are not strictly part of functional programming but statically typed FP is the most popular form of FP and sufficiently important to warrant a mention. Types help compilers generate efficient code but types in FP are as much for the programmer as they are the compiler. Types express properties of programs, and the type checker automatically ensures that these properties hold. They can tell us, for example, what a function accepts and what it returns, or that a value is optional. We can also use types to express our beliefs about a program and the type checker will tell us if those beliefs are incorrect. For example, we can use types to tell the compiler we do not expect an error at a particular point in our code and the type checker will let us know if have made an incorrect assumption. In this way types are another tool for reasoning about code.</p>
<p>Type systems push programs towards particular designs, as to work effectively with the type checker requires designing code in a way the type checker can understand. As modern type systems come to other languages they naturally tend to shift programmers in those languages towards a FP style of coding.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-isn%E2%80%99t">What Functional Programming Isn’t</h2>
<p>In my view functional programming is not about immutability, or keeping to “the substitution model of evaluation”, and so on. These are tools in service of the goals of enabling local reasoning and composition, but they are not the goals themselves. Code that is immutable always allows local reasoning, for example, but it is not necessary to avoid mutation to still have local reasoning. Here is an example of summing a collection of numbers. First we have the code in Typescript:</p>

<p>Here’s the same function in Scala:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> sum<span>(</span>numbers<span>:</span> List<span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>var</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span></span><br><span>  numbers<span>.</span>foreach<span>(</span>x <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span></span><br><span>  total</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In both implementations we mutate <code>total</code>. This is ok though! We cannot tell from the outside that this is done, and therefore all users of <code>sum</code> can still use local reasoning. Inside <code>sum</code> we have to be careful when we reason about <code>total</code> but this block of code is small enough that it shouldn’t cause any problems.</p>
<p>In this case we can reason about our code despite the mutation, but neither the Typescript nor the Scala compiler can determine that this is ok. Both languages allow mutation but it’s up to us to use it appropriately. A more expressive type system, perhaps with features like Rust’s, would be able to tell that <code>sum</code> doesn’t allow mutation to be observed by other parts of the system<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Another approach, which is the one taken by Haskell, is to disallow all mutation and thus guarantee it cannot cause problems.</p>
<p>Mutation also interferes with composition. For example, if a value relies on internal state then composing it may produce unexpected results. Consider generators in Javascript. They maintain internal state that is used to generate the next value. If we have two generators we might want to combine them into one generator that yields values from the two inputs. Here’s the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span>type Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> Generator<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span> never<span>&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> index <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>yield</span> index<span>++</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> zip<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>left<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> right<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>b<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span><span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>zipIt</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> l <span>=</span> left<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> r <span>=</span> right<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>l<span>.</span>done <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>r<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>const</span> result<span>:</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>l<span>.</span>value<span>,</span> r<span>.</span>value<span>]</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>            <span>yield</span> result<span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> <span>zipIt</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This works if we pass two distinct generators to <code>zip</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>However if we pass the same generator twice we get a surprising result.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> inf <span>=</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span>inf<span>,</span> inf<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>The usual functional programming solution is to avoid mutable state but we can envisage other possibilities. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">effect tracking system</a> would allow us to avoid combining two generators that use the same memory region. These systems are still research projects, however.</p>
<p>So in my opinion immutability (and purity, referential transparency, and no doubt more fancy words that I have forgotten) have become associated with functional programming because they guarantee local reasoning and composition, and until recently we didn’t have the language tools to automatically distinguish safe uses of mutation from those that cause problems. Restricting ourselves to immutability is the easiest way to ensure the desirable properties of functional programming, but as languages evolve this might come to be regarded as a historical artifact.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>I have described local reasoning and composition but have not discussed their benefits. Why are they are desirable? The answer is that they make efficient use of knowledge. Let me expand on this.</p>
<p>We care about local reasoning because it allows our ability to understand code to scale with the size of the code base. We can understand module A and module B in isolation, and our understanding does not change when we bring them together in the same program. By definition if both A and B allow local reasoning there is no way that B (or any other code) can change our understanding of A, and vice versa. If we don’t have local reasoning every new line of code can force us to revisit the rest of the code base to understand what has changed. This means it becomes exponentially harder to understand code as it grows in size as the number of interactions (and hence possible behaviours) grows exponentially. We can say that local reasoning is compositional. Our understanding of module A calling module B is just our understanding of A, our understanding of B, and whatever calls A makes to B.</p>
<p>We introduced numbers and Lego as examples of composition. They have an interesting property in common: the operations that we can use to combine them (for example, addition, subtraction, and so on for numbers; for Lego the operation is “sticking bricks together”) give us back the same kind of thing. A number multiplied by a number is a number. Two bits of Lego stuck together is still Lego. This property is called closure: when you combine things you end up with the same kind of thing. Closure means you can apply the combining operations (sometimes called combinators) an arbitrary number of times. No matter how many times you add one to a number you still …</p></div></div>

          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.

          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.

        <p>
          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>
