<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>If you pop out into space, you die. No oxygen to breathe, no ambient pressure makes your bodily fluids boil, UV radiation burns your skin to a crisp. It's not a good place to be for humans. So in order to survive, you need to bring a number of things along, commonly called the "life support system". This talk explains how this works!</p>

<p>How do oxygen generators and CO_2 scrubbers work? Do you need to heat or cool your craft? If you eat beans and fart a lot, do you ever get rid of the smell? Can you just fill your spacecraft with plants and live off them? <br> This talk goes through historic, present and future ways that life support is managed in spacecraft, spacesuits and future planetary outposts. It also explains why you have to breathe your own pee on the International Space Station. <br> (This is the logical followup to the two previous, german talks about how to fly spaceships and how to build them, from the GulaschProgrammierNacht 13 and 16)</p>

In so many ways, a remarkable piece of engineering.  Efficient, comfortable, and not so bad in the cargo territory.  In it’s plugin form, it can run 20-25 miles on pure EV power, and after that, it still chugs along at 40mpg.  For people wanting to dip their toes into the electric vehicle world, it’s not a bad place to start, assuming you’re okay with the styling.</p><p>With all that, what the HELL went wrong when they ‘designed’ the dashboard and the information systems?  </p><p>I’m rarely speechless when it comes to engineering projects, particularly ones backed by such a well respected and successful company as Toyota.  But jumpin jehosephat.  Who the heck designed the dashboard?  It’s… it’s… nnnnng…. well… let me show you.</p></div>



<h2>The Dashboard – An Introduction</h2>



<p><br>First, lets take a look at the interior.  This is the 2019 Prius Prime dashboard, directly from Toyota’s brochure…</p>



<figure><a href="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="549" src="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg 1024w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-300x161.jpg 300w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-768x411.jpg 768w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1536x823.jpg 1536w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-2048x1097.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Now before I go straight to the jugular, lets note a few positive aspects here.</p>



<ul><li>A large, centrally located touchscreen.  I like that.  It’s easy to reach, everyone in the car can see it, it’s bright and visible. </li><li>The steering wheel has easy to reach controls, right under the thumbs.  Nice.</li><li>The upper display (directly in front of the window) has 3 smaller screens that can show a variety of information panels.  The most obvious one is a speedometer, but the other options are battery usage, mileage, map directions, etc.  As compared to the Tesla, which puts everything on one display in the middle of the car, these secondary displays that ALWAYS display certain information is a nice touch.</li></ul>



<h2>Well, that’s nice, but what’s your beef?</h2>



<p>Sounds all peachy so far, right?  I mean, it looks all shiny and clean, so what’s wrong?</p>



<p>Turns out, plenty.</p>



<p>Lets start at the meta level.  That big central display?  It only controls a small subset of the car systems.  It’s a bad design to have to go hunting for an external button or switch or toggle or display to get a basic function that the display should have on it.</p>



<p>Another problem with the central display are the buttons on the glass on either side.  Those are flush contacts.  You have to look at them to determine if you’re pushing them, and there’s no feedback when you do.  Talk about distracted driver problems.  No feedback contact buttons should be used VERY CAREFULLY in motor vehicles.  Why some of these buttons are glass and others in the car are standard switches, I have no idea.</p>



<h2>Okay, but lets hear the real fails.</h2>



<p>Okay, you asked for it, lets start running down some absolutely batshit decisions made on this car.</p>



<ol><li>Lets start simple.  Seat heaters.  Everyone loves ’em, right?  Took us literally googling and watching youtube videos to figure out how to turn them on.  The controls for the seat heaters are tucked under the dash, on either side of the central console.  Once I scrunched down in the seat, bent my head to one side, I was able to see them.  My wife, who is a foot and a half shorter than I am, never saw them either.  Who thought this was the appropriate placement for these switches?</li><li>Remember those little screens under the front windshield?  Nice, aren’t they?  Well, they are configurable.  You can change what each one shows.  At some point, my wife brought up “Hey, that middle display used to show how much battery time I had left, now it doesn’t.  How do you change that?” – I, a systems engineer, could absolutely not figure out how to change those displays.  The answer?  Tap the right arrow on the steering wheel right control pad.  No other feedback that this is how to do this – no menus, no prompts, no information – I had to google this one too.  There’s nothing on that nice big central display that lets you configure these smaller displays.  They are completely separate.</li><li>At one point we were driving around at night, and I was wondering why the central screen was so bright.  Most cars switch into ‘night mode’ when it gets dark, but this screen was blazing white.  Going through all the menus, I found a screen setting for ‘DAY MODE’ ON/OFF – what exactly that means is sort of a mystery.  There was no NIGHT MODE ON/OFF.  Just that one toggle.  Turns out, you need to use the OTHER screen control.  The one on the left side of the steering column around knee height.  There’s a dial there that on older cars would set the brightness of the dashboard instruments.  Some bright engineer at Toyota decided that if that little knob was spun to a certain point, the central console would always be in day mode.  the DAY MODE apparently can override this setting?  Who knows – but having to go off-screen to some random control when the option should have been RIGHT THERE on the screen is definitely a fail.</li><li>Backup beeper.  Did you know the Prius has a backup beeper?  Going by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-up_beeper">Wikipedia</a> : <quote>A back-up beeper, also known as back-up alarm or vehicle motion alarm, is a device intended to warn passers-by of a vehicle moving in reverse. They typically produce 1000 Hz pure tone beeps at 97-112 decibels.[1] Matsusaburo Yamaguchi of Yamaguchi Electric Company, Japan, invented the back-up beeper. It was first manufactured as model BA1 in 1963.[2] ISO 6165 describes “audible travel alarms”, and ISO 9533 describes how to measure the performance of the alarms</quote><p>Great idea, right?  Except the Prius backup beeper SOUNDS INSIDE THE CAR.  Not externally.  You can’t hear it outside.  Who exactly is this supposed to be warning?</p></li><li>The mapping software sucks.  I mean, you just can’t get around it.  It’s cumbersome, it’s painful to use, the search functions are absolute shit, and it’s just a nightmare to try and use productively.  Took us another zillion years to figure out how to turn off the turn by turn navigation (you can’t except via a buried setting – makes listening to music really terrifying – why can’t you just say ‘turn off turn by turn for now, I’m listening to something cool, I don’t need the interruptions telling me that I’ll be on this interstate until the heat death of the universe.’</li><li>Most functions are disabled while in motion.  This seems to carry over from day 0 of cars getting anything more complicated than an FM stereo head unit.  Someone somewhere said “We should disable any function that may be a distraction to the driver, with no option to get around it”, and so it was.  But, what if you’re traveling in a modern vehicle that thoughtfully placed the navigation system between the driver and passenger seat, where the passenger has the same access as the driver, wouldn’t it make sense to allow the passe… NOPE!  Locked out!  You can’t modify your route or destination or settings while in motion.  DENIED.</li></ol>



<h2>Denoument</h2>



<p>I’m sure I’ll be adding to this list as more things come up.  What’s bothersome about all this is so much of this can be fixed in software.  But as far as I can tell, Toyota is following the auto manufacturer trend of assuming once a model year of a car is complete, so is the software, and it doesn’t need to change.  They may do minor tweaks and fixes, but they do not actually revise the systems with major improvements (unlike Tesla, who put out <a href="https://www.teslafi.com/firmware.php">major software updates pretty much constantly</a>, frequently adding new features or overhauling others).  </p>



<p>It may sound like I’m bashing Toyota and ignoring flaws in other manufacturers.  That’s not the case at all.  I’ve written in the past about <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2019/09/02/ev-cars/everything-wrong-with-my-tesla-model-3-performance/">my issues with the Tesla Model 3</a>, and while I didn’t have a lot of complaints about my <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/05/09/geekitude/one-week-with-the-chevy-volt/">Chevy Volt</a>, there were some <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/07/30/hacks/ownstar-vulnerability-in-onstar-application-for-gm-vehicles/">frustrations with GM</a>.  (In fact, I had some UX problems with the Volt as well, but the Volt didnt’ have the big touchscreen that SHOULD have made those problems easy to fix.)</p>



<p>Modern car manufacturers absolutely need to get on board, and stop thinking of the dashboard with a touchscreen as just a ‘shiny’ version of the old knobs and dials dashboards.  It’s a fully functioning digital information and control system, and should be treated as such, with regular updates, and some put into UX design.  Tesla is the only company that is doing this right.  What the heck is everyone else thinking?</p>

      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to
      legitimate traffic.
    </p>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</code></pre>

			<p><i>Happy Holidays. This week we are reprinting our top stories of 2020. This article first appeared online in our “Energy” issue in June, 2020.</i></p><p><span>D</span>ear Bella,</p><p>I’m going to imitate Rudyard Kipling and tell you a just-so story. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the world 100 years ago. He wrote <i>The Jungle Book</i>. And also <i>Just So Stories</i>, which began as bedtime stories he told his daughter Josephine. They were about how animals got their famous features, like the camel’s hump and the leopard’s spots. Kipling was a wonderful writer but he made up his animal stories. My story is based on science, which means many people, through many recent experiments, have concluded things might “just so” be the way of this story.</p><p>It’s also a story about evolution, which is nature’s research and development department. Like Kipling, I’ve given a human voice to certain things: Bacteria form committees and petition the research and development department for answers to their problems, as do plants and dinosaurs. And the R&amp;D department (which is to say, evolution) tries to come up with solutions. I’m going to call evolution “Mr. R&amp;D.” When he finds a problem, Mr. R&amp;D tests things out in different ways to come up with a solution. But sometimes those solutions have unforeseen consequences. So here we go!</p><blockquote><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. But why did dinosaurs have them?</p> </blockquote><p>Once upon a time, on a cold day in January, I was jogging through Regent’s Park in London, stepping carefully through flocks of geese, seagulls, pigeons, and ducks surrounding the boating lake. But, perhaps because of the book I had just been reading (Nick Lane’s <i>Oxygen</i>) my eye picked out a couple of geese that were strangers in this flock: Bar-headed geese, a boy and a girl.<br></p><p>But what were they doing in London in January? During the winter, they usually live in the middle of India, and in the summer they live in Kazakhstan or Mongolia. If you look at a map of the Earth, you can see the barrier between Kazakhstan and India is the Himalayan Mountain Range, the tallest in the world. Every year, millions of bar-headed geese migrate over the Himalayas and have been doing so for millions of years. They have been seen flying at 28,000 feet. They have flown over Mount Everest! How do they do that?</p><p>The answer seems to be that bar-headed geese, like all birds—hummingbirds, ostriches, pigeons—have super-efficient lungs. It makes our lungs—and the lungs of all mammals—look primitive. I’m sure when birds get together they gossip about how pathetic our lungs are!</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17339_169ea72d893b7bfe6a36b531a78b48af.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BIG AIR:</strong> Dinosaur’s lungs were so efficient that when oxygen levels rose over tens of millions of years, they were able to get very big—bigger than land mammals like elephants have ever gotten, or ever could get.</span><span>VectorPlotnikoff / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>All mammals, including us, breathe in through the same opening that we breathe out. Can you imagine if our digestive system worked the same way? What if the food we put in our mouths, after digestion, came out the same way? It doesn’t bear thinking about! Luckily, for digestion, we have a separate in and out. And that’s what the birds have with their lungs: an in point and an out point. They also have air sacs and hollow spaces in their bones. When they breathe in, half of the good air (with oxygen) goes into these hollow spaces, and the other half goes into their lungs through the rear entrance. When they breathe out, the good air that has been stored in the hollow places now also goes into their lungs through that rear entrance, and the bad air (carbon dioxide and water vapor) is pushed out the front exit. So it doesn’t matter whether birds are breathing in or out: Good air is always going in one direction through their lungs, pushing all the bad air out ahead of it.<br></p><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. Birds are dinosaurs! When I was growing up in the 1940s, there was a category in biology called Aves, which meant birds. But scientists have now folded Aves into a category called Dinosauria, and those dinosauria, like pigeons and seagulls and geese, are flying all around us today. If you want to know what a dinosaur probably tasted like, eat some chicken!</p><blockquote><p>Plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this.</p> </blockquote><p>So, dinosaurs had this super-efficient lung system, and they successfully strode the Earth as the dominant species, starting around 250 million years ago to about 65 million years ago, when a huge asteroid crashed into Mexico and most of them went extinct. Except for birds. But why did dinosaurs have this super lung system in the first place?<br></p><p>To answer that, we have to go way back, to when plants came out of the ocean onto land, about 450 million years ago. Earlier than that, plant life lived only in the ocean: The surface of the Earth was a desert.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, some pioneer plants got together and said, “Let’s go!” and migrated up onto land. But once the plants got out of the water, they discovered something they never had to deal with in the ocean: gravity. In the ocean, if you’re a plant, you can just float, because the density of a plant is not that different from water. Out of the ocean, the density of a plant is much greater than air, and so gravity can pull it down.</p><p>So for many tens of millions of years, plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this, and decided to form a committee to request an exemption from Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello. What’s your problem?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Our problem is gravity. We never had to deal with it in the ocean, and it’s a problem for us on land.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Why is gravity a problem for you?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: We want to do what we did in the ocean, which is absorb lots of sunlight, and the best way to do that is to have a long stalk, and then to have branches with leaves at the end of the branches and maximize our potential to absorb sunlight.</p> <p><b>MR. R&amp;D</b>: I understand what you want, but it will take me some time. Come back in a million years or so.</p> <p><i>The plants twiddle their thumbs for a million years.</i></p> <p><b>PC</b>: OK, a million years is up! Did you manage to discover something?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Yes, let me see, I think I have it in the drawer. Here it is: lignin.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: What’s lignin?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: It’s a rigid molecule made of carbon and hydrogen. If you absorb it into the cells of your body, it will interact with the molecules of floppy cellulose you already have, and this will create a very firm structure that will allow your cells to become like bricks. You can then stack one cell upon the other, and you can go as high as you want.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: How high?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Over 300 feet.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Wow!</p> <p>So the plants happily swallowed the lignin, and sure enough, it worked exactly as Mr. R&amp;D said, and within a short time stalks, trunks, branches, roots, leaves began popping up all over the Earth.</p> <p>The only problem was that when one of these trees reached the end of its natural life, bacteria and fungal spores got ready to decompose it, sharpening their knives. But when they got to the lignin, their knives stuck: They couldn’t digest the lignin. The very thing that made lignin strong defeated the bacteria and fungi back then. So, they did what we do when we eat a chicken dinner: They ate all the meat and left the bones, which is to say: the lignin.</p><p>Eventually another tree would die and fall on top of the first, and then the same thing would happen again, and another and another, and it kept going like this for hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions of years. In the end, over 100 million years of dead trees and ferns and undigested lignin were deposited under the surface of the Earth. We call the time when most of this happened the Carboniferous (carbon-making) age.</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17341_c9dcf2529a5f4bf66234540fbe60b74e.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BUG OUT:</strong> Around 300 million years ago, there was so much oxygen that insects, who have inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies (seen here in a lifesize model in Italy) had a wingspan of about three feet.</span><span>life_in_a_pixel / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember how evolution sometimes has unforeseen consequences? Well, this deposit of lignin produced an oxygen surge in the atmosphere. Because for every hydrocarbon atom that goes into the Earth, an oxygen atom is not used up in the decay process. Massive amounts of carbon (lignin) were going into the Earth, so massive amounts of oxygen were building up in the atmosphere. Today, oxygen is 21 percent of the atmosphere. But around 300 million years ago, oxygen was well over 30 percent. There was so much oxygen that insects, who have very inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies had a wingspan of three feet, millipedes were eight feet long. Amphibians—frogs and such—also have inefficient lungs, and they were able to get as big as dining room tables.<br></p><p>The microorganisms of the time eventually became aware of this surge in oxygen. The insects and the amphibians didn’t seem to care, because they were dependent on that rich source of oxygen. So the now-worried microorganisms got their committee (MC) together and went to see Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello, what I can do for you?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: We think there is a dangerous situation developing, because oxygen levels have gotten higher every year and they might now be at 35 percent.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: So?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: With indigestible lignin, there is nothing to keep it from continuing to go up.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: I see your point, because at 43 percent a lightning strike will cause the entire atmosphere to ignite since it is so high in flammable oxygen. And the whole experiment of life on Earth will be over. Yes, I agree we have to do something. Give me a million years and I’ll see what I can do.</p> <p><i>For a million years, oxygen levels continue to rise. The even more worried microorganisms come back to Mr. R&amp;D.</i></p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: The bad news is I don’t have anything physical to give you. But I can give you a koan.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: What’s that?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: A koan is something you can think of that will help you in …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> 
<p>Pijul for VS Code is an extension for Visual Studio Code which adds integration with Pijul as a source control management system.</p>
<p>Why develop my own extension instead of contributing to the existing one? It didn't even occur to me to check if one already existed
when I started, and when I did my own extension had enough distinct features to set it apart.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>At present, this extension offers <em>most</em> of the basic features necessary for local Pijul development on a single channel. It includes basic
commands for initializing a repository in a VS Code workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add, Reset, or Record one, some, or all of the files in the Pijul Repository.</li>
<li>Decorations in the file tree indicating the current state of each file.</li>
<li>VS Code comparison integration for diffing files with their last recorded versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else still needs to be done on the command line.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Requires an existing Pijul installation. <a href="https://pijul.org/manual/installing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instructions for installing Pijul can be found here</a>.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>On the Source Control View, deleted files show up as their parent directory (This is the result of a Pijul CLI limitation)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Pijul for VS Code hasn't been published on the extension marketplace yet, so it needs to be built and installed from the source.
To do so, folloow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Install Visual Studio Code Extensions (VSCE)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>npm install -g vsce
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Package the extension</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>vcse package
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and run the "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." to install the VSIX file you created in the last step </li>
</ol>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>With the eventual goal of releasing on the Extension Marketplace with the same level of quality as other source control extensions,
there are a number of areas which will require a great deal of further refinement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper handling of VS Code workspaces with multiple folders</li>
<li>Automatic detection of Pijul installations</li>
<li>More robust .ignore file handling</li>
<li>Greater configurability</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of Pijul features which still need implementation to reach a publishable minimum viable product, suitable for local Pijul development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amending changes</li>
<li>Moving and removing files</li>
<li>Ignore file mangagement</li>
<li>Basic change log</li>
<li>Basic channel management</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long term, I would like to offer more in-depth Pijul integration, with the goal of providing a better experience than can be offered on the command line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote management</li>
<li>Inline <code>pijul credit</code> annotations</li>
<li>IntelliJ style changeset system</li>
<li>Splitting/Combining existing changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category probably could probably fit a couple more points that I haven't thought of.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Pijul for VS Code welcomes all contributions. Before contributing, please be sure to add the following hook to your Pijul config file:</p>
<pre><code>[hooks]
record = ["yarn run lint --fix"]
</code></pre>

<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Global Unique Identifiers</a> (GUIDs), also known as Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) can be used as practically unique identifiers in systems.</p><p>GUIDs have many advantages. You can safely generate identifiers in a distributed setting, compared to a central identifier registrar. Many systems are vulnerable to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor">Insecure Direct Object Reference</a> attacks, and even though permissions should always be checked for any access, it’s much easier to exploit these with sequential IDs compared to GUIDs (<a href="http://debarghyadas.com/writes/hacking-into-the-indian-education-system/">a high profile example</a>). Sequential IDs can leak <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14524061">important information</a>. Modern databases have custom <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-uuid.html">in-built</a> UUID types which have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29882952/3399432">less storage overhead</a> and perform better than using a text type. There’s tons of <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/">blogs</a> extolling the benefits of GUIDs.</p><p>But anecdotally, there’s too many cases where raw GUIDs are used as identifiers, even though they might not be the appropriate choice.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>By their nature, GUIDs are opaque values that don’t lend too much information about what they’re identifying. They’re also generally unergonomic due to their length and structure. It’s almost trivially obvious that GUIDs shouldn't be in URLs due to their <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontPutGuidsInUrls">poor aesthetics</a>. To steal an example from <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids/">Coding Horror</a>, database queries at the REPL can become frustrating.</p><pre><code>$ select * where userid='{BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10}'</code></pre><p>Poorly formatted log statements/errors can become harder to debug, since the identifiers don’t tell us what they’re identifying: </p><pre><code><code>error processing BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10: nil</code></code></pre><p>This can be mitigated by having libraries that report stack traces/line numbers and help identify the exact line of code with the error, so in general, UUIDs often need context to aid debugging.</p><p>Moreover, the lack of type safety of using raw integers and raw UUIDs can cause <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/27/uid/">horrifying problems</a> and is emblematic of lack of type safety with identifiers. With poor naming in code, it’s very easy to cause problems. Consider a variation of the example from the linked blog:</p><pre><code>def get_team_and_user_ids() -&gt; List[Tuple[UUID, UUID]]:
  """Returns a tuple of (team_id, user_id) tuples"""
  ...

def ban(user_id: UUID) -&gt; None: ...

for (user, team) in get_team_and_user_ids():
    ban(user)</code></pre><p>The script might just error out since UUIDs between users and teams aren’t shared, but the consequences might have been worse with integer IDs.</p><h2>Designing your Identifiers</h2><p>Identifiers should be designed for the properties of object they’re going to be identifying. We can mix and match components based on the importance of mutability, debuggability, performance and privacy for the object. For example, identifiers for permanent or external objects like customers should be treated differently to ephemeral or internal objects like tasks/jobs.</p><p><strong>Structure identifiers with prefixes and hierarchies</strong></p><p>Often for internal objects, debuggability is key, and prefixes can help with debugging. For example, all task identifiers could have the prefix “task-”. This automatically makes context free debugging easier, and makes it easy to grep for all messages that have IDs:</p><pre><code>error processing task-2: nil</code></pre><p>Hierarchies help even more with debuggability. Let’s say that every “Job” spawns N “Tasks”. Tasks IDs might want to contain their job IDs, so that it becomes trivially simple to grep for tasks of a particular job. For example, a task ID would look like: `job-123-task-1`. This also helps in ad-hoc database queries to find relevant rows without complex JOINs. We have examples of this in real life, like area codes in phone numbers.</p><p>We can add constant prefixes/hierarchies to any existing ID type. Critics might point out that storing a prefix with a UUID is wasteful since we’d lose the benefits of database optimized UUID types. This can easily be mitigated by storing un-prefixed UUID in the database, and application code automatically prepends a prefix for client code to use, but this might add some complexity.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content Addressability</a></strong></p><p>Sometimes, we want a zero inconsistency approach to storing objects, so it might make sense to make the identifier (or part of it) the checksum of the content that is to be stored. This guarantees that the underlying content has not been modified. Git does this with SHA1 commit hashes (<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition/">even though this is being migrated to SHA256 as of December 2020</a>). <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> (build system) uses a Content Addressable Store for <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">remote caching</a>.</p><p><strong>Semi sortability</strong></p><p>If you need basic sortability and don’t mind the privacy concerns, consider using a scheme like Segment’s <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid">KSUID</a>. This side-steps use of sequential IDs which will be painful to migrate away from. <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid#2-collision-free-coordination-free-dependency-free">UUID1 has some known issues</a>.</p><h2>Type Safety</h2><p>At the very least, identifiers should not be allowed to float freely as strings or integers in order to prevent a class of inconsistency bugs. SQLAlchemy, a database manipulation library in Python, lets user implement a custom <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html#sqlalchemy.types.TypeDecorator">TypeDecorator</a> (and has native support for Postgres UUIDs). Let’s reproduce an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49398042/3399432">example</a> with some tweaks:</p><pre><code>from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import uuid
from typing import NewType

db = SQLAlchemy()

FooId = NewType("FooId", bound=UUID)

class Foo(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(FooId(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, 
                   default=uuid.uuid4, unique=True)</code></pre><p>With a custom type “FooId” being marked as the column type, <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">type checking</a> will prevent other ID types or raw UUID types there.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We’ve seen that there’s a fair amount of complexity involved in id management and decision making. Some high scale applications end up deploying <a href="https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/">custom ID generation</a> services. Identifiers are an early, hard to reverse decision that affect even schemaless datastores, so they’re worth thinking about in advance, and the right decision can compound developer productivity and prevent painful infrastructure migrations down the road.</p></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>To say I was a gamer in my teenage years is an understatement. However, the gaming scene today is vastly different, and it's clear from Twitch and YouTube gaming that people really enjoy watching others play. For me, gaming has always been about the stories and the worlds that provides an escape from the present world. Second to that, I enjoy conversing with friends about all things gaming.</p><p>I am an adult now with responsibilities towards work and family. My passion for games got lost along the way. People say, if you really are passionate, you will make time. This is true to a certain extent. Life isn't always that simple.</p><p>Anyway, earlier this year, I was searching for a place where the topic of conversation is gaming without the negativity of the real world. Three of us (similar age and jobs) found comfort in <a href="https://basecamp.com/personal">Basecamp Personal</a>. I take full credit for this idea and execution because when I initially suggested Basecamp; I was told, the last thing we need in our life is another corporate app. The idea is to escape work. It's all a matter of perspective, one needs to look at a software objectively and use it for your use case.</p><h2 id="what-is-basecamp">What is Basecamp?</h2><p>Well, in this case, it's a one-stop shop for all things gaming between close friends. <em>In the real world, Basecamp is a premier project management + internal communication tool for remote WFH teams worldwide.</em> With over 3.3 million Basecamp accounts created, it seems well regarded in the project management world etc. I am no expert, but I am responsible for 10 of the 3.3 million Basecamp accounts, and we do not use these for work or any revenue generating activities.</p><h2 id="why-basecamp-personal">Why Basecamp Personal?</h2><ul><li>Multi Platform — Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and any modern browser</li><li>Privacy focused</li><li>Free</li><li>Flexible and modular</li></ul><p>We all work in big corporations, and you wouldn't believe that most apps/services are blocked by our IT department. On the other hand, Basecamp works perfectly.</p><p>At first, we were cautious of using Basecamp for free because, as you know, nothing in life is free. If you do not pay financially, you will pay through sacrificing your privacy and/or data (🤔 Gmail, Facebook etc). Fortunately, <strong>some things in life are still free with no other costs, and Basecamp Personal is a delightful example of this.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-we-use-basecamp">How we use Basecamp?</h2><p><em>Note: My friends were not keen on making our Basecamp setup public, so I attempted to recreate it and basing the characters in this story on David and Jason (<strong>for light-hearted fun only</strong>) to give you an example of how we use Basecamp Personal.</em></p><p><em>The ease of account creation is the single most reason I attempted to recreate our Basecamp setup. In addition, Basecamp only asked for my name and email address. Nothing else! No credit cards, no secret questions, no personally identifiable information. <strong>It's actually nice to have your privacy respected. A strange feeling.</strong></em></p><p>Basecamp is our safe place where we discuss, plan and have fun with gaming. Basecamp is very modular and therefore allows us to turn off any “tools” (features) that are irrelevant. We disabled:</p><ul><li>Message Board</li><li>To-dos</li><li>Email forwards</li><li>Automatic check-ins</li></ul><p>I also appreciated the option to re-arrange the tools, allowing me to put Campfire (most used) on the top left etc.</p><figure><img src="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 1000w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 1600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 1919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>GAMING HUB</figcaption></figure><p>This leaves us with a very custom setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Docs &amp; Files:</strong> starter guides, books, cheat sheets, maps, etc</li></ul><figure><img src="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png" alt="" srcset="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 1000w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 1600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 1604w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><strong>Campfire:</strong> lively discussions on gaming, sharing screenshots, betting on when Cyberpunk will come out.

Thankfully, Basecamp<a href="https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/86-how-notifications-work"> offers in-depth control of notifications</a> to your liking.</p><hr><h2 id="perfect-use-case-example-">Perfect USE CASE Example:</h2><p>Recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a> was released and in our childhood, we had spent hours if not days playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage">Streets of Rage series</a>. Replaying this together again in our adulthood, resurfaced memories of the time when all we did was enjoy and have fun in each other’s company through our passion for gaming.</p><p>Using Basecamp, we organised when we will play online, our respective characters and argued over who will pick which character. We also discussed our childhood memories. It’s fascinating because each of us vividly remembered stories that the others had forgotten. We shared Easter eggs we found. The music and the overall feel of the game is an enormous walk down nostalgia street.</p><h2 id="basecamp-for-task-management">Basecamp for Task Management</h2><p><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things by Culture Code</a> is my task management app of choice and has been for over 2 years now. As much as I enjoy using Things, it bugs me that I cannot use it at work (Windows) and cannot attach files to my tasks. I actually tried to move to Basecamp for all things task management but the limitation of 3 projects (5 would be ideal) and lack of repeating tasks was a dealbreaker and the paid up version is $99 a month which is out of the question for me.</p><p>I will say this, if it suits your workflow, Basecamp Personal is excellent for personal task management. It's extremely flexible, intuitive, collaborative (up to 20 users), well designed and a very reliable service.</p><p>Considering how unreliable our current corporate solution is, I pitched Basecamp to my organisation’s IT head. It’s likely this will gain any traction as changing software for an organisation of 30,000 people is no easy task.</p><p>My intention behind this post is to demonstrate the importance of having an open mind and think outside the box, thus allowing you to objectively evaluative the best use of tools in your arsenal. Basecamp is viewed as a business software solution. However, it's clear from my use case, that one shouldn't pigeonhole software into categories.</p><h5 id="my-heartfelt-thanks-to-the-entire-team-of-basecamp-and-the-founders-for-providing-basecamp-personal-free-of-charge">My heartfelt thanks to the entire team of Basecamp and the founders for providing Basecamp Personal free of charge</h5>

Looking at my dashboards, it's fallen short of the <a href="https://questinglog.com/2019-year-in-review">goals I set last year</a>, but it's still considerable progress given all that's happened.
<small>(Disclaimer: These numbers haven't been audited and are simply what I've pulled from various accounts and spreadsheets.

It was the <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit</a> I'd already announced would be a freebie for my existing Alchemist Camp subscribers last Black Friday.</p> <p><strong>#4 (miss)</strong>: I've been in Taiwan all year since arriving from Japan at the end of February and wasn't able to make it to an Elixir conference in the US. I won't count this one due to the pandemic.</p> <h2 id="new-products"><a href="#new-products">#</a> New products</h2> <p>I released two new products this year, both for Elixir devs.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter"><a href="#phoenix-igniter">#</a> Phoenix Igniter</h3> <p>Phoenix Igniter is a <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit for building Phoenix apps</a> that includes various boilerplate code I've found myself writing repeatedly across projects. It's in beta, and is useful for me but I'm having a hard time getting any user feedback.</p> <p>Thus far, it's been entirely driven by what I want on my own projects. It's a one-time purchase product, so sales are very spikey. I gave it away to every Alchemist Camp subscriber during Black Friday of 2019, so there are considerably more users than paying customers.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/igniter-chart-2020.21f716f4.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>I have high hopes for Igniter. Ultimately, I can see it appealing to a much broader group of devs than my screencast subscriptions on Alchemist Camp can.</p> <h3 id="_5-little-potions"><a href="#_5-little-potions">#</a> 5 Little Potions</h3> <p>5 Little Potions is an <a href="https://alchemist.camp/little-potions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ebook for beginner Elixir learners</a> and I'm currently about 45% of the way writing it. I had a few goals in starting this book. First of all, I wanted to have something substantial for beginners. About the first 15 screencasts or so I did for Alchemist Camp are aimed at beginners, but the last 150+ have been aimed more at peers and people digging into specific topics.</p> <p>I also felt like coding some games instead of just business-focused web apps!</p> <p>It hasn't brought in a lot of revenue, due to the low price, but I think it's a great way to reach more learners. As I finish the 3rd, 4th and 5th games in the book and get ready for its launch, I expect to see quite a few more people buy.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/potions-chart-2020.fe47bae1.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>Okay! Let's have a look at the stats...</p> <h2 id="financial-stats"><a href="#financial-stats">#</a> Financial stats</h2> <h3 id="alchemist-camp"><a href="#alchemist-camp">#</a> Alchemist Camp</h3> <ul><li>Alchemist Camp revenue: $18,846.63 (+35%)</li> <li>Wage per hour: ~$38 (+52%)</li> <li>Paying subscribers: 96 current</li> <li>Lifetime retention: 60%</li> <li>Expenses: $4901.56 (-1%)</li> <li><strong>Profits: $13,945.07 (+55%)</strong></li></ul> <h3 id="expenses-breakdown"><a href="#expenses-breakdown">#</a> Expenses Breakdown</h3> <ul><li>Stripe: $2,295.98</li> <li>ConvertKit: $441</li> <li>Digital Ocean: $316.86</li> <li>Domain names: $120</li> <li><strong>Services Total: $3,222.84</strong></li> <li>Technical books: $724.15 (Mostly Manning, Pragprog and No Starch Press)</li> <li>Screencasts and courses: $954.57 (about 50/50 business and technical)</li> <li><strong>Educational Total: $1,678.72</strong></li></ul> <p>This year's expenses ended up almost identical to last year. However the breakdown is very different. Stripe cost considerably more, due to a combination of higher volume, increased fees and using more services. In particular, Stripe moved its customers from Subscriptions (for which I was a free forever plan) to Billing, which has a percentage fee on every transaction.</p> <p>Another major cost increase was due to my moving from Mail Chimp to ConvertKit. I was spending $49/month for marketing email services for most of the year. It wasn't worth it for me in the end, so I migrated to SendFox.</p> <p>My educational spending was less than half what it was last year. That's not because I'm any less of a believer in investing in it, but mostly due to being behind my revenue goals and finding better bargains.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter-starter-kit"><a href="#phoenix-igniter-starter-kit">#</a> Phoenix Igniter (starter kit)</h3> <ul><li>Phoenix Igniter revenue: $1,140</li> <li>Stripe fees: $44.16</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,095.84</li></ul> <h3 id="_5-little-potions-ebook"><a href="#_5-little-potions-ebook">#</a> 5 Little Potions (ebook)</h3> <ul><li>5 Little Potions revenue: $1,575</li> <li>Gumroad fees: $129</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,446</li></ul>  <ul><li>YouTube Views: 77.7k (+26%)</li> <li>Monthly Unique Visitors: ~12k (excluding bots)</li> <li>Accounts created (all time): 4705</li></ul> <h2 id="big-wins"><a href="#big-wins">#</a> Big wins</h2> <ol><li>My RSI is nearly healed!</li> <li>Podcasting with Justin Vincent</li> <li>Overcoming crazy obstacles</li> <li>The idea muscle</li> <li>Doubling down on learning</li></ol> <h3 id="healing-wrists"><a href="#healing-wrists">#</a> Healing wrists</h3> <p>Three years and a month ago, I could barely use a phone or mouse at all. It hurt just to brush my teeth. I had <em>severe</em> repetitive stress injuries and was in a pretty bad bind.</p> <p>Even <a href="http://localhost:8080/2020-year-in-review/#wrists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>, I was still far from better. It's a big part of why I've put so much time into reading, podcasting and other hands-free activities the past couple of years.</p> <p>But now, I'm finally feeling about 90%. I still do stretches and still do 100% of my computing from an ergonomic keyboard (or iPad + pencil), but I can actually bang out an 8-hour day of coding and typical computer use and feel okay the next day. I'm not pushing it, but I'm <em>thrilled</em> about the improvement!</p> <h3 id="the-reactor-am-podcast"><a href="#the-reactor-am-podcast">#</a> The Reactor.am podcast</h3> <p>The level of serendipity I experience in my life sometimes astounds me and this is one of those cases. In my yearly review last year, I wrote:</p> <blockquote><p>But then this spring, a funny thing happened. I got sucked into this long-running podcast called <a href="http://techzinglive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techzing</a> and started listening to the archives (which go back ten years) and I heard some interviews they did with Amy Hoy.</p></blockquote> <p>Well, things have progressed. I just finished recording the 44th episode of <a href="https://reactor.am/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reactor.am</a>, a mastermind-based podcast a few hours ago. My co-host is Justin Vincent—one of the two co-hosts of Techzing. He's got far, far more entrepreneurial experience than I do and it's been a good learning experience.</p> <p>This certainly wasn't remotely a goal or something that even seemed within the realm of possibility a year ago, but it's been great! If we're living in a simulation, I'm pretty sure I'm a player character 😎</p> <h3 id="overcoming-crazy-obstacles"><a href="#overcoming-crazy-obstacles">#</a> Overcoming crazy obstacles</h3> <p>I was in Taiwan on a 90 day visa-free entry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PPfl4XRxh4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when borders started closing</a> due to the pandemic and managed to get an entrepreneur visa good for a year.</p> <p>Then later in the spring, my bank closed my account and disabled my debit card due to an error, while I was abroad... in the middle of the pandemic. That was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxCra7EaPQc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">truly a crisis</a> since 100% of my income flows through the account and I needed things like food, housing and water.</p> <p>But, I managed to hustle and overcome both obstacles mostly intact. All I lost was some sleep and some time. All-in-all, that's not bad for 2020.</p> <h3 id="the-idea-muscle"><a href="#the-idea-muscle">#</a> The idea muscle</h3> <p>I've been religiously sticking to James Altucher's <em>Idea Muscle</em> practice, picking a topic and generating at least 10 ideas every day. It seems like a small thing, but after a month or two, I really started feeling a difference. I attribute both the book I'm currently writing and my increased screencasting productivity to it.</p> <p>I've been doing all of it on an iPad and just using Apple notes with the pencil and it's been just as good in terms of writing, thinking and processing as a paper and pencil were last time I tried this but it's easier to save and review them.</p> <h3 id="doubling-down-on-learning"><a href="#doubling-down-on-learning">#</a> Doubling down on learning</h3> <p>I've continued aggressively trying to deepen my technical skills while picking up some new ones that will help me make progress as a founder. Humble Bundles and ebook purchases in general have been paying off the most.</p> <p>One great thing I've realized is that an iPad + pen is a near ideal tool for active reading. I can fearlessly highlight the heck out of any book I read and later erase any highlights I don't want to keep.</p> <h2 id="what-didn-t-go-so-well"><a href="#what-didn-t-go-so-well">#</a> What didn't go so well</h2> <ol><li>Growth</li> <li>Decision paralysis</li></ol> <h3 id="growth"><a href="#growth">#</a> Growth</h3> <p>My audience is growing just as slow as it was a year ago. I noted an increase in competition in the market then and it seems to have continued, likely in part due to the pandemic.</p> <p>At that time, I wasn't too concerned and saw such competition as likely to grow the market overall and mostly have little effect on me. Now I'm not so sure.</p> <p>Elixir is a <em>tiny</em> market, and I'm seeing the low-end of it getting flooded with new courses while the total number of people learning it or using at work is fairly flat.</p> <p>This is part of why I've broadened my business into adjacent territory with the book and the starter kit and why I'm looking at still other opportunities involving software as opposed to educational products.</p> <h3 id="decision-paralysis"><a href="#decision-paralysis">#</a> Decision paralysis</h3> <p>I know I can make faster progress than I have so far, but it's <em>very</em> difficult to evaluate what business efforts are worth investing time into.</p> <p>I'm currently evaluating a <em>lot</em> of options, including finding contract work and investing money as well as time into a project.</p> <br>   <br> <h2 id="goals-for-2021"><a href="#goals-for-2021">#</a> Goals for 2021</h2> <ol><li>Break $75k total revenue</li> <li>Launch a SaaS product, likely a micro-SaaS</li> <li>Find a banking setup I can rely on while living outside the US</li> <li>Finally travel to the US for an Elixir conference???</li> <li>Grow sales in all three existing products</li></ol> <p>Despite everything, I'm feeling even more confident this year than I did last year. I may experience some pain revolving around banking and residency status again, but I'll find my way through it and keep investing in the long-term.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25587873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussion on HN</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>It all started at my first job. I’ve been around 6 months in the company and was happy getting used to the ropes of my current job. In those 6 months, I quickly pushed to prod (without even knowing it) and was learning very fast. I still remember when my boss called me to his office: We are going to do some changes and you’ll lead this new 3 person team. I thought to myself: Cool, I’ve learned some books about leadership, this could be fun.</p>



<p>The tricky part was the members of the team. They were a couple of technicians who had more than ten years on the job and more than twenty years in the company ( I was twenty years old). One of them was even a team lead recently. I did not understand the mechanics of that re-org at the time and still don’t have all the information about what was happening. I wish I had some cool story about why I was chosen to lead the team, really don’t know.</p>



<p>It was not a walk in the park, things started to get ugly before they could get better. As expected they pushed back a lot, they did not like the change, me, or anything that was happening. It’s funny, looking back I think my ego should have been hurt based on all the times they tried to avoid working with me and change things. I guess I was so confused with everything that I had no time for that.</p>



<p>When we started to work together, one thing was clear: they were not in the mood to take orders from a kid. I was not in the mood to give orders to them. This particular situation helped me a lot and shaped the way I work ten years later.</p>



<p>Given that it was almost impossible to give orders and avoid starting a world war. I started listening, that’s what I did the most in the first weeks. I listened and asked questions. Not like interrogations, more like curious questions. I think the key to the questions what that I wanted to learn from them. I was not a trick, I was very interested in what they were doing.</p>



<p>I still remember some kind of pranks they pulled on me. They would tell me they had run out of a particular material they needed. I had made a lot of calls and research to try to find it for them, then they magically found some in the warehouse or the car they used. I did not know these were pranks, I learned later when they had another team lead (I laughed that time).</p>



<p>With some retrospective, I think these pranks were not just to pick on the new guy. I think they were testing me. They wanted to see what I did, would I forget about the problem, slack off, blame it on them, or take ownership and be part of the team. Most of the time I came with solutions and discussed alternatives with the team. Some weeks later I think they started to trust me.</p>



<p>There was a point where I started to notice that I could help with some things. Not so much in executing, but there were some things they needed help with. Mostly operational excellence. They were relieved to have someone handle that. Every week we were becoming a better team.</p>



<p>Patience was a foundation for this team. At least from my side. I did not rush things out (I was not even sure how to do that) and never try to impose my ideas or way of working. I trusted a lot the team and things started to look better.</p>



<p>Not everything was perfect. We had disagreements and sometimes we preferred different approaches. This is normal in all teams, the good part is that we started to have a process. We had a daily meeting, talked about what we needed to do that day and we talked briefly at the end of the day. Every side learned to cede sometimes and when months have passed we were playing by ear.</p>



<p>Even though we were a productive team and technically very respected, what I always treasure from these experiences is human relationships. I still have a great time whenever I talk to these two people and we have a blast remembering the good old days. Based on what they say, they learn a thing or two from me, but I learned a ton from them and that experience.</p>

<p>They are more accurate than complicated devices in the laboratory, they know “something is wrong” faster and cannot be fooled.  In Poznań, mussels have been keeping water purity for 26 years.  The TVN24 reporter checked what exactly their “work” is all about and whether the inconspicuous barks have raised the alarm. </p>
<p><span>In Poznań, 26 years ago, mussels were “employed” to check the safety of water, and more specifically large ones.  The capital of Greater Poland was the first Polish city to decide on such a solution. </span></p>
<p><span>– Working as a microbiologist, I always thought to introduce a system that would work independently and would be based on living organisms.  The idea was for such a system to give us information about the quality of the water.  When looking at chemical tests, you can check a lot of things, but for each type of test you need a separate device – says Grzegorz Podolski, senior technologist for water quality at Aquanet. </span></p>

</p><p><span>It is different with biomonitoring.  – Here one organism, in this case a clam, checks many parameters and if there is any chemical contamination, it lets you know.  And that’s enough to take a sample, take it to the laboratory and see what it is about: confirm or deny that something is happening to the water.  It is a system that ensures safety against pollution and even terrorist activities.  The work of the mussels is closely related to what the laboratory does, adds Podolski. </span></p>
</div>
<h2>Work for two months </h2>

<p><span>Clams nourish themselves by filtering the water.  They are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution and much more than humans.  That is why they belong to the indicators, i.e. species of plants and animals that have a low degree of tolerance to changes in conditions in the environment in which they live. </span></p>
<p><span>How many mussels were given a “job” and how long they can work was checked and described in the instruction by scientists from the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.  – We have three measuring devices in the company and eight clams in each.  In total, we “employ” 200 individuals during the year – says Podolski. </span></p>
<p><span>Within an hour, one individual can filter 1.5 liters of water.  – It is a good cooperation.  We have full democracy and gender equality here, because we have both male and female individuals – says Dorota Wiśniewska, spokesman for Aquanet SA in Poznań. </span></p>
<p><span>Each clam is first prepared and fed.  Then it goes to a special flow-through aquarium.  And there, for two months, they are on “duty”.  – This is the time when he can work and live safely.  Then the “workers” return to their natural environment, that is, to water reservoirs – explains Wiśniewska. </span></p>

<h2>They filter and alarm </h2>

<p><span>Biomonitoring based on mussels consists in constant, round-the-clock observation and registration of their shell movements.  How it’s working? </span></p>
<p><span>– Mussels open the shells and every now and then take in a small amount of water, filtering out everything that is suitable for eating.  When the water is polluted, they do their best to separate from it, and everyone’s shells just close at the same time.  This happens within two minutes.  If two or three clams close, it doesn’t have to mean anything, but if there are eight, it’s an alarm.  Then our role is to find out what has upset them so much and find out if it is a real or a false alarm – says Podolski. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span>– Have they all shut down?  – the TVN24 reporter asks. </span></p>
<p><span>– There has not been such a situation for these 26 years.  The water that goes to the mussels is of very good quality – adds Podolski. </span></p>
<p><span>Scientists have translated these clam responses into ‘computer language’.  – The mussels are glued to the plastic pedestal.  In addition, a magnet disc is glued to the shell, and a probe is mounted nearby that detects changes in the magnetic field.  When the clam closes or opens, it touches the probe with this magnet.  And we translate it into an image of the degree of opening and closing – explains the Aquanet employee.  </span></p>

</div>
<p><span>– During these 26 years, when we talk about the work of mussels during “open doors” or educational lessons, they always arouse positive emotions and great interest.  Visitors are always surprised that such small creatures play such an important role – adds Wiśniewska. </span></p>
<p><span>Water biomonitoring in Poland is carried out in several water supply companies, including in Łódź, Warsaw and Silesia. </span></p>

So, I wanted to attempt to derive a learning progression for developers.</p><p>At each level of development, I recommend a few books. Each book hopefully is a thread you can pull on, if you want to go deeper into a particular topic.The book recommendations are subjective, but I believe that one can chart their own curriculum following the basic model.

This is where most of the <em>‘coding’</em> happens. The amount of time that will be spent reading your code will be multiples of the amount you would take to write it.

The abstraction at which you operate is still typically your team but the way you look at things becomes more outward looking.</p><p>In modern software development, distributed systems are ubiquitous. Even when you are making a change to a single service, that service most likely lives in an ecosystem of other services and a plethora of other distributed tools.

</p>


<p>
Well, I'm finally bringing this series back from a months-long hiatus! In the
<a href="https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-2.txt.html">last post</a>, we started implementing an
emulator for a simple instruction set of our own. We sketched out the overall
architecture, and implemented a few instructions for moving data between virtual
registers and memory, learning about the corresponding x86-64 instructions
along the way. In this one, I want to focus on arithmetic and logic operations,
which will allow our emulator to do stuff that is a bit more interesting than
just moving bytes around. But before we jump into that, I want to briefly talk 
about how numbers are represented in a computer.
</p>

<h2>Number Representation</h2>

<p>
If you've made it this far in the tutorial, chances are that you understand the
basics of how the binary notation for numbers works, and don't need an
explanation of what bits and bytes are. So I'm not going to spend time on that.
</p>

<p>
However, there are some particular details related to representing signed
integers. Theoretically, this topic should be a part of any computer
science curriculum. But not every coder has a formal CS background, and even
among those that do, most either don't remember or have never encountered
these things in practice - because one simply doesn't have to think about them
for the vast majority of time when programming computers.
</p>

<p>
But number representation <i>is</i> important for understanding the arithmetic
instructions that we're going to be looking at; therefore, I feel like I can't
simply gloss over the topic.
</p>

<p>
If you already know how signed integers work in most computers, this might be a
good refresher, otherwise you might learn something new!
</p>

<h2>Representing Integers</h2>

<p>
Computers can't represent "numbers" in the abstract, mathematical sense.
They're finite, discrete machines and there's not enough memory in the world to
store a representation of an arbitrarily large quanitity, or even the
representation of a rather small, but "weird" quantity like
<a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">tau</a>.
</p>

<p>
We cope with that limitation by conceding that we'll never be able to represent
an arbitrary number. Instead, we use the resources at our disposal to represent
a subset of all numbers. We look at all the bit strings of a fixed
length, and agree that each of them represents a particular number.
However many different bit strings we can deal with, that's how many different
numbers we can represent.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can represent 256 distinct numbers using 8 bits, because there
are 256 different bit strings of length 8. Generally speaking, it is entirely up
to our interpretation <i>which</i> 256 numbers these strings represent.
For example, you could decide to interpret each of the 8 bits as a binary digit,
so that the entire 8-bit bitstring is nothing more than its corresponding
number, written out using the binary numeral system. On the other hand, you
might decide that the first 6 bits specify the "whole" part of the number, and
the remaining 2 bits specify the "fractional" part (this is called fixed-point
representation and used to be commonplace before the wide spread of
hardware-accelerated floating point arithmetic). It all depends on which subset
of numbers interests you at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
Certain instructions of a given processor have baked-in assumptions about the
representation used by their parameters, and behave accordingly. For example,
the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/addps">addps</a> SSE instruction
assumes that its parameters are floating point numbers adhering to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> standard. We're
more interested in instructions doing simple integer arithmetic, but those also
assume a certain representation, as we're about to see.
</p>

<p>
Let's have a look at some of the possible ways to represent integers in a
computer. For the sake of simplicity and readability, I am going to use eight
bits for everything, but all of this extends to a larger number of bits in a
straightforward manner.
</p>

<p>
In case of positive integers, the simple and straightforward mapping is to
just use a given integer's binary representation, as we've mentioned before.
If the representation doesn't take all of the available eight bits, we'll pad
out the number with zeroes from the left (the additional whitespace in the
middle of the bit string is added just for readability):
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2</td><td>10</td><td>0000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>3</td><td>11</td><td>0000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>4</td><td>100</td><td>0000 0100</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
So far, so good. But things start to get sticky when we introduce negative
numbers into the mix. How would you represent a number like -5? Sure, if you
were doing math with a pencil and a piece of paper, you could just write "-101"
instead of "-5" and be done with it, but you can't exactly do that with a
computer.
</p>

<p>
The initial instinct might be to use the leftmost (most significant) bit to
indicate the sign. If the very first bit of a bit string is 0, then we assume the number to be
positive. If it is 1, we assume the number to be negative.
This way of coding signed numbers is called "sign-and-magnitude representation"
and it was used in some very old machines.
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-3</td><td>-11</td><td>1000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-2</td><td>-10</td><td>1000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>1000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Astute readers might have noticed an interesting problem here.
We've assigned the string "0000 0000" to 0, but how are we to interpret the
string 1000&nbsp;0000? It's -0, so the effective value it represents is just 0.
It looks like we ended up with two representations for a zero - one "positive"
and one "negative".
</p>

<p>
While having two representations for the same number is kind of ugly, it's
actually the least of our worries. In fact, the standard for floating point,
IEEE 754, mentioned earlier, does have the notion of "negative zero", and it's
no big deal. But nevertheless, the sign-and-magnitude representation is not used
on any modern machine that I am aware of. That is because there is a <i>much</i>
better way of representing signed integers, that not only avoids having two
representations for 0, but actually ends up being much easier to deal with in
hardware. However, in order to really understand why this alternative
representation we're about to propose is better, we need to take a little
detour.
</p>

<h3>Learning to Add</h3>

<p>
Let's mentally put integer representation on the backburner for a minute.
Let's think about how CPUs work on the lowest possible level (the lowest that I
can grasp myself anyway).
</p>

<p>
The most basic component of a CPU is a switch that can be controlled by an
electrical current: when a current is present, the switch is ON, and when there
is no current present, the switch is OFF. You could build a crude switch like
that yourself using a few pieces of metal, insulation and some wire - it's
called a relay.
</p>

<p>
Some early machines might have used relays (which were huge and unreliable), but
modern machines use a different kind of switch - the transistor, which is 
semiconductor-based. It's extremely reliable, and can be made so tiny that 
it's possible to cram billions of these things into a small space. Still, the
principle is the same - a transistor is a simple switch, controlled by
electrical current, it's just miniscule in size.
</p>

<p>
By wiring switches together in a particular manner, one can build <i>logic
gates</i> - tangible hardware implementations of the AND/OR/NOT/XOR/etc.
functions that most programmers are familiar with. For example, here's a diagram
showing how you can build an OR logic gate from two switches:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/sw_OR_tmb.jpg">
<br>
<small><i>Image credit: simplecpudesign.com</i></small>
</p>

<p>
If any one of the switches (labelled A and B respectively) is turned on, the
output (labelled Z) will have current.
If both A and B are off, Z will have no current. Switches act as "operands" for
the logical OR operation, and the output Z represents the result.
</p>

<p>
Logic gates can be further wired together to make more complex circuits, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
So, fundamentally, a CPU is a giant collection of interconnected logic gates
that consist of tiny electrically operated switches. With that in mind, I invite
you to consider the question: how does a CPU actually do arithmetic? For
example, how does it add two positive integers?
</p>

<p>
Turns out, you can wire together logic gates to make circuits that can perform
arithmetic operations.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider adding two single-bit numbers. Forget about negative numbers for
now, let's just handle positives. Note that result itself can be larger than
1 bit, so we'll add a second, "carryover" bit to it. There are only 4
possibilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>0 + 0 = 0 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>0 + 1 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 0 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 1 = 0 in the result bit, 1 in the carryover bit</li>
</ul>

<p>
The pattern in the result bits looks like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a> for a
familiar boolean operation - exclusive OR (aka XOR). The pattern in the
carryover bit looks like the truth table of a boolean AND operation. So, a
circuit for adding two single-bit values can be built with a XOR gate and an AND
gate. It's called a half-adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/ha.png">
</p>

<p>
When we try adding two 2-bit numbers, things start to get real hairy. We need to
take into account the carryover bit from adding the first two bits when adding
the second two bits. So we can't just string together two half-adders to add two
2-bit numbers. We need to design a circuit that adds <i>three</i> bits: two 
"regular" bits and one carryover bit from the previous single-bit addition.
Such a circuit is called a full adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/fa.png">
</p>


<p>
By stringing together a half-adder and a full adder, we can finally get a
circuit that can add two-bit numbers:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/2-bit-addr.gif">
</p>

<p>
In general, by stringing together several full adders one after another, we can
build blocks for adding numbers with more bits. Such blocks are called
ripple-carry adders.

<p>I’ve been in a reflective mood lately, probably because it’s the end of a very eventful year. Change is all around us and technology is the enabler.</p>



<p>On that note, I’ve been thinking a lot about my own experiences with technology-driven change in the reinsurance industry, where I worked as an analyst from 2017 until recently.</p>



<p>During these three short years, I observed a radical shift in data analysis methodologies. Excel-based models, which had seemed top-of-the-line suddenly were too slow and too rigid; Integration with 3rd party data sources, which was once a luxury, became the norm; And analysts began to utilize scripts to accomplish many labor-intensive tasks typically performed by hand or in spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Enabling this change is a suite of accessible Python-powered tools. These technologies are rapidly displacing the old way of doing things, ushering in a new wave of reinsurance models and the talent needed to support them.</p>



<p>Admittedly, the following observations do come from a very niche industry. But I believe that the broader trends discussed here will also apply to other legacy companies and sectors.</p>



<p>In this post, I explore the following topics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Section 1</strong> – An introduction to reinsurance</li><li><strong>Section 2 – </strong>The need for technological disruption in the reinsurance industry</li><li><strong>Sections 3 to 5</strong> – How Python is replacing Excel</li><li><strong>Section 6 </strong>– Arguments against adopting new technologies</li><li><strong>Section 7</strong> – The evolution of the reinsurance industry</li></ul>



<p>If you are curious about the transition from Excel to Python but aren’t interested in reinsurance, skip to section 3.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="406" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>1. Reinsurance, from an analyst’s perspective</h2>



<p>Most people understand insurance, but few have heard of its rather exotic sounding cousin: reinsurance. So, before I begin, here’s a quick intro:</p>



<p>Just as individuals transfer risk to insurers in exchange for a premium, insurers too must mitigate their risk by transferring some or all of their liabilities to one or more reinsurance companies. This enables insurers to protect themselves in the case of a large event, such as a hurricane, which affects many individual policyholders. Without reinsurers, insurance companies would not be able to survive catastrophes and would be much more risk averse, ultimately impacting the end consumer.</p>



<p>Reinsurance programs come in a variety of flavors to suit the need of the reinsured. I’ll spare you the details but suffice it to say that all potential reinsurance programs must first be analyzed. In industry speak, this is the process of “pricing a deal”.</p>



<p>For each deal, brokers gather relevant data from the insurance companies and send it to potential reinsurers as a “submission”. It is the underwriting analyst’s responsibility to parse this data, enter it into Excel-based models and produce a number.</p>



<p>This number, the loss ratio, represents the expected loss divided by the total premium and typically ranges between 10% to 150+%. LRs above 100% mean that the premium is not sufficient to cover the losses that we expect based on our model. In other words, we’d be writing the deal at a loss.</p>



<p>In reality, reinsurance companies have pricing hurdles well below 100% because they have other money outflows to account for such as brokerage (intermediary fees) and G&amp;A (general and administrative expenses).</p>



<p>The point is, Excel is the key piece of software that enables underwriting teams to assess new business. Throughout the company, different teams use different models, each with different processes and different pricing hurdles. But the one common theme is that all of the models are based on Excel spreadsheets. That’s just how the industry works. Everyone uses Excel for everything.</p>



<p>Well, until recently.</p>

<h2>2. Change is coming</h2>



<p>In an industry that is notoriously behind the times, a fundamental change is underway. This change is in response to new business demands, including:</p>



<ol><li>The desire to price increasingly complex deals with increasingly large datasets</li><li>The desire to integrate with 3rd party data to augment pricing models</li><li>The desire for faster models and robust codebases that adhere to software development best practices</li></ol>



<p>Excel fails miserably at these tasks.</p>



<p>First, expressing complex reinsurance deals requires tabs and tabs of structural details, interlinking formulas and limiting assumptions. It’s a mess to build and a headache to understand. Have a lot of data? That’s more tabs and formulas to add to the model. Performance slows dramatically and minutes of your life are wasted waiting for bloated spreadsheets to finally open.</p>



<p>Second, you’re forced to use the VBA programming language if you want to query external data or implement user-defined functionality. According to one Stack Overflow survey, VBA ranked “most dreaded” of all the languages, which wholly sums up my feelings. The development environment is not user friendly, the syntax confusing, there’s no support for unit testing –&nbsp;I could go on.</p>



<p>Third, Excel is fragile. Views and logic are intermingled, making it very hard to troubleshoot errors. Also, models aren’t put into source control, so you can’t restore an old version. Massive spreadsheets with dozens of tabs frequently crash without warning, much to the dismay of underwriting analysts (like myself).</p>



<p>During my three years in reinsurance, I witnessed a dire need for new tooling. And, from what I observed, it is clear that this tooling will be powered by Python.</p>







<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>3. The future is Python</h2>



<p>As a technical underwriting analyst with programming skills, I was among the first to build and benefit from what I think are the next generation of pricing tools. These tools fall into two main categories:</p>



<ul><li>Excel models running Python code</li><li>Python notebooks in the browser</li></ul>



<p>Both options offer enhanced analysis capabilities while still catering to a non-technical or semi-technical end user.</p>



<p>Now, let’s explore each technology in more detail.</p>



<h2>4. Excel models running Python code</h2>



<p>The first category of new technology is based on augmentation. Rather than adding VBA code to your Excel spreadsheet, you can use Python instead. This is possible thanks to 3rd party Excel add-ins such <a href="https://www.pyxll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PyXLL</a>, which brings the power of Python data analysis into the humble spreadsheet.</p>



<p>When you open Excel, the add-in makes your Python code accessible either as functions or as macros. This means that you can write Python code in the development environment of your choice, add unit tests, integrate with 3rd party libraries and push to source control.</p>



<p>PyXLL facilitated a step change in how we construct reinsurance models. Specifically, here’s how our setup looked before and after augmenting our model with Python:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Before Python</strong></td><td><strong>After Python</strong></td></tr><tr><td>We used an Excel spreadsheet-based model with dozens of tabs containing complex formulas, endless pivot tables and unintelligible VBA code.</td><td>The tangled mess of VBA was re-written into independent Python modules, each of which performs a distinct function.</td></tr><tr><td>The spreadsheet took 30+ seconds to open.</td><td>The Excel spreadsheet is now just a view, so it is lightweight and quick to open.</td></tr><tr><td>There was no visibility into errors. “Debugging” meant manually breaking apart lengthy Excel formulas.</td><td>The new model logic is testable and can be upgraded independently.</td></tr><tr><td>We were limited by the assumptions made when the model was first created, with little ability to add new features.</td><td>The codebase lives in source control, enabling multiple collaborators to work in tandem.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Developers can use their preferred development environment.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A robust peer review process helps to perpetuate high quality code.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Using PyXLL, we built an underwriting pricing model powered entirely by Python code. We were able to express structural complexities of deals at a level never before achieved. And we were able to add simulation-based pricing techniques that simply cannot be done using spreadsheets alone.</p>



<p>The impact of PyXLL on how we build models and ultimately price business cannot be understated.</p>



<p>Which leads us to the second technology that is changing the way we perform underwriting data analysis…</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>5. Python notebooks in the browser</h2>



<p>The second novel approach to reinsurance risk assessment and pricing is enabled via Python notebooks. These are web-based documents that can contain narrative text, live code, charts and visuals, plus results from your data analysis. </p>



<p>Python notebooks are all about collaboration, visualization and rapid iteration. They are a way to execute code with minimal setup and overhead, making it easier for new programmers to explore data outside of Excel. One of my favorite parts of notebooks is how easy it is to access your data, whether that’s from a file, SQL databases or an external source.</p>



<p>Let’s look at what a data analysis project looked like for me with and without Python notebooks:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Without Python Notebooks</strong></td><td><strong>With Python Notebooks</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Manually query SQL databases and copy data into Excel. Keep data fresh by re-querying SQL and copying in new data.</td><td>Drop in a csv file, connect directly to an internal SQL database or utilize a 3rd party API to retrieve external data.</td></tr><tr><td>Perform analysis using Excel functions, pivot tables and VBA code. Functions quickly became unwieldy and difficult to troubleshoot.</td><td>Manipulate data easily and rapidly using Python libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Collaborate with a colleague by closing Excel and letting your colleague know that the spreadsheet is available for them to work on.</td><td>Collaborate with colleagues by sharing the notebook.</td></tr><tr><td>Copy tabular results and charts into Word or Powerpoint and add written narrative as necessary.</td><td>Export results to csv or generate professional-looking PDFs to give directly to key stakeholders.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Add explanatory narrative directly to the document alongside related code blocks.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Create interactive charts and static visuals using libraries like <a href="https://plotly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plotly</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seaborn</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matplotlib</a>.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leverage existing libraries like <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SciPy</a> or <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scikit-learn</a> to …</td></tr></tbody></table></figure></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>I envy voracious book readers. They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p>
<p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p>
<p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p>
<p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p>
<p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p>
<p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p>
<p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p>
<p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p>
<p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when youâ€™re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p>
<p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p>
<blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote>
<p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p>
<p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p>
<p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p>
<p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p>
<p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Promotional text:

Over the holidays, spent some time reflecting on the past 7 years of Sourcegraph and the state of developer tools in general. Very excited to see what the future holds (and to bring the future sooner with our work). It's time to buildâ€”developer tools: https://beyang.org/time-to-build-dev-tools.html

-->
<h2><span>It's time to build developer tools</span><span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2020.12.29</span></h2>
<p>We are living through a golden age in developer tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+is+eating+the+world">Software is eating the world</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=every+company+is+a+software+company">Every company is now a software company</a>.</p>
<p>Every software company needs developers—and developer tools.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of companies building tools for developers is booming. If you are a developer who loves the art and craft of programming, if you like working on <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/optimizing-a-code-intel-indexer/">technical problems beyond scaling CRUD</a>, or if you love the idea of accelerating technological progress by building tools for people like yourself, you should think about working on dev tools!</p>
<h2>Historic forces, immense opportunity</h2>
<p>Every company that now writes code has discovered (or is discovering) that software development is really tricky. The world needs more software, but it’s not as simple as hiring more developers. Building software doesn’t scale or parallelize easily. Serial dependencies coupled with unforeseen complexity lead to gross underestimates of timeline and budget, which in turn lead to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/30/companies-that-failed-at-digital-transformation-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them">bad</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/why-so-many-high-profile-digital-transformations-fail">business</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/heres-why-ge-fords-digital-transformation-programs-failed-last-year.html">outcomes</a> and even <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2010/08/19/10-great-companies-that-lost-their-edge">existential</a> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/companies-went-bankrupt-innovation-lag.asp">crises</a>.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of developing software quickly and efficiently at scale, more and more companies are building and buying developer tools. It’s no longer just the Googles, Facebooks, Microsofts, and Amazons of the world spending serious money doing so.</p>
<p>To satisfy this increasingly apparent need, a rapidly growing new industry of developer tool companies has arisen in recent years. Individual names like GitHub, GitLab, and HashiCorp are now well known and the emergence of the field has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/16/developer-tools-quietly-become-a-growth-story/">not</a> <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/rise-of-the-developer">gone</a> <a href="https://alven.co/the-debrief-go-to-market-in-dev-tools-part-1/">unnoticed</a>.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to overstate how quickly the market for developer tools has grown in the past decade.
When Quinn and I started Sourcegraph back in 2013, we quickly discovered that “dev tool” was a dirty word among investors. Developer tools, it was thought, were super valuable, but most of them were single player tools that didn’t make enough money (e.g., JetBrains, Sublime Text), internal tools built for the specific needs of a particular big tech company (e.g., Google Code Search), or open-source projects that no one paid for and which you could only make money from by selling services and support. Investors told us there was just one billion-dollar company that sold to developers—Red Hat—and it was the exception that proved the rule.</p>
<p>Developers were building lots of valuable software that was sold to other folks—salespeople, marketers, designers, etc.—but when it came to their own work, the common refrain was, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159004/the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes">“the cobbler’s children have no shoes”</a>. An article in TechCrunch lamented, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/22/will-developer-tools-startups-ever-find-investors/">“Will Developer Tools Startups Ever Find Investors?"</a></p>
<p>But then, somewhere along the line of the past seven years, something changed. Evidence of this shift is in the valuations: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">GitHub acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/-gitlab-valued-over-6-billion-in-secondary-share-sale.html">GitLab valued at $6 billion</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/hashicorp-soars-above-5b-valuation-in-new-175m-venture-round/">HashiCorp at $5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/czech-startup-founders-turn-billionaires-without-vc-help">JetBrains estimated at $7 billion</a>, the list goes on.</p>
<p>But though the big numbers with lots of zeroes raise eyebrows and make the headlines, they are just the byproduct of the underlying factors driving big changes in where and how software is built. To list a few of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> Competition from Big Tech and tech-enabled startups moving into every industry is driving every company to prioritize software as a core competency.</li>
<li><strong>Big Code:</strong> The amount of code in the world has been growing rapidly, and more and more companies have reached a tipping point previously reached only by the largest tech companies.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise OSS:</strong> The maturation of “the cloud” as a software platform built on top of open-source software (Linux and Kubernetes), in contrast to older software platforms, which were vertically integrated proprietary ecosystems (e.g., Windows + .NET + Visual Studio).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other trends at play here, but one thing is certain: almost every valuable or growing company is now building software and most have realized they need great developer tools to compete.</p>
<p>This is fantastic news. “Tech” has traditionally been a distinct sector of the economy, and the ability to build software effectively at scale was confined to a handful of big technology companies. Now, companies in every sector understand that code has to become a core part of their DNA. And this means the impact of code and software is amplified. No longer does the value proposition of software have to flow through some product or service offered by a “tech company”—companies across every sector of the economy are now learning how to build great software themselves.</p>
<p>As the broader economy learns to build software, progress will accelerate. All the promises that the future holds—<a href="https://grail.com/">cures for cancer</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">life-saving</a> <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/">medicine</a>, <a href="http://uber.com/">mass</a> <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">individualized</a> <a href="https://comma.ai/">transportation</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-rockets-fly-with-software-you-can-find-on-your-android-phone/">rocketships</a>, and more—will arrive sooner in large part thanks to code. Software has long been recognized as a technological accelerant. But developer tools are now a <em>second-order accelerant</em> on technological progress. This is an immense opportunity.</p>
<p>How best to pursue it?</p>
<h2>Large companies, open source, and startups</h2>
<p>There are three places where you can work on developer tools. (There may be more, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on these.)</p>
<p>The first is inside a large non-developer-tool company. Many large companies that build software are investing heavily in internal tools. There have been a lot of great dev tools created inside large companies, and many such tools have inspired the creation of similar tools outside the company. Blaze, the build system of Google, inspired other build systems like Pants and Facebook’s Buck and was later itself open-sourced as Bazel. Large companies also offer the benefit of a large, stable salary. The downside is that the direct impact of your work will likely be limited to a single organization. It’s possible that your work will be open-sourced down the road, but there is no guarantee, and it can often take years to get the necessary legal and bureaucratic approvals to do so. And, of course, you don’t have a direct piece of the financial upside if the tool becomes super widely used.</p>
<p>The second place you can build dev tools is on an open-source project. Working in the open guarantees you will receive recognition for your work, and you also have the benefit of not having any pesky pricing considerations standing in between your users and your product. If mass adoption is your primary goal, then open source holds great appeal. Many of the most widely used developer tools—Git, Linux, Emacs, Vim, etc.—are open source projects. The downside, of course, is lack of revenue. Most open-source authors and maintainers have an alternate source of income (often working at a large tech company). Patreon and GitHub Sponsors are great, but it’s likely that only a small fraction of open-source creators will ever earn enough to make a comfortable living through sponsorship alone. The number of hours you can devote to working on open source will be constrained by where you can find sources of income.</p>
<p>The third place is at a developer tools company. Most such companies will be startups, because of the rapid growth in market size for dev tools over the past few years. Dev tools companies offer the benefit of aligned incentives: your users, your customers, and even your fellow engineering teammates are often the same people. If you build a great tool, then your users are happy, you get paid so you are also happy, and you and your teammates can also make use of the same tool, so that should make you doubly happy! Dev tool startups have the additional benefit of financial upside (assuming part of your compensation is an equity stake in the business). This upside could be substantial. Personally, I think we are in the early days of the developer tools market. I believe the impact of high-quality, broadly useful dev tools will someday far exceed the impact of <a href="https://www.google.com/">ads-driven web search</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">PC operating systems</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.com/">social media</a>. Which is to say, I think that the value of developer tool companies will someday exceed the combined value of the most valuable tech companies today.</p>
<p>Of course, startups also carry a downside risk. There is a high chance that the company will fail to meet its lofty goals, or may need to lay people off, or fail completely. There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for the best place to work. Personally, the principle I follow is, “Maximize expected utility subject to minimizing the risk of ruin,” where the definition of “utility” and “ruin” is up to you to define.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you opt for large companies, open source, or dev tool startups, there is still the question of how to evaluate which specific opportunities and tools are worthy of your time. For that, you’ll need to rely on a combination of intuition and worldview, which we’ll discuss next.</p>
<h2>Scratch your own itch, but understand the big picture</h2>
<p>Jamie Zawinski once said, “The best motivator in the world is scratching your own itch.” He was talking about developer tools, and he was right. Most developer tools start with a programmer noticing they have a problem, imagining a way to fix the problem through software automation, and then writing the code that implements that automation. Building for yourself means you get to wear the hat of product manager, engineer, and customer simultaneously. This is a fantastic recipe for building something truly useful, not just for yourself, but for other people who feel the same pain. As you evaluate the landscape of enterprise developer tools, you should rely heavily on your own intuition for where pain points exist and which products offer effective solutions.</p>
<p>However, you’ll also want to combine your direct intuition with a broader view of how software development works—what is common across companies and sectors and what is different and specific to the segment of the market you are building for. It’s important to understand where your itch fits into the overall picture, how others experience that itch, and how <em>their</em> itch fits into <em>their</em> picture.</p>
<p>The way software is …</p></div></div>

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

			<h6>Computer cases, in their majority, have some significant disadvantages. They are close-type plastic boxes almost identical to each other and are located mainly under our desks.
New trends such as “case-modding” and “custom desk-setup” appeared to change the monotony of ordinary computers, or even offices, by gaming-enthusiast users who mainly focus on building high-end hardware and opting for top class performance!
However, such a passion drives easily to exaggerations, both in the aesthetic and operation sector, with PC implementations that have tremendous energy needs, high temperatures, air-flow problems and of course high costs!

        <p>This post is for everyone who is trying to start a company right now. </p><p>The headlines make it seem easy. </p><p>20 year old kids raising millions of dollars to build the next Snapchat. Smug digital nomads posted up on a beach in Thailand making $75k/month. That lifestyle design dude who made $200k selling a Twitter course this year. </p><p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's fucking hard. </strong></p><p>At least it was for me. </p><p>I wanted to be a millionaire by 30. I was broke at 25. </p><p>I launched dozens of products, navigated through the minefield, and came out of it with business that exceeded all my expectations - millions in annual recurring revenue. </p><p>Here's the true story. </p><h2 id="year-0-inspiration-">Year 0 (inspiration)</h2><p>About 10 years ago I unofficially graduated university. </p><p>I had the credits to finish early, but stuck around to take one last class. That class </p><p>New Venture Design - it paired up business and engineering students to build a company. </p><p>That class changed my life.</p><p>My accounting major put me in the "useless business guy" category, so I consciously recruited the only two software engineers in the class. </p><p>The project we dreamed up was a daylighting system for commercial office buildings we called Luminex. </p><p>Essentially, reflective venetian blinds that tracked the sun and automatically reflected light into the ceiling - so you can work at your computer with natural light and no glare. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-5.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png 625w"><figcaption>Rendering of the project</figcaption></figure><p>Still one of my best ideas. </p><p>Instead of testing it in the market, the primary objective of that class was to compete in business plan competitions. Which just means pitching to students and professors. It had nothing to do with building a successful business. </p><p>We won three competitions - &nbsp;taking home $15,000 in prize money. </p><p>It was a great way to cap off my university career. </p><p>We graduated in May 2011, and decided to pursue the idea full-time. </p><h2 id="year-1-optimism-">Year 1 (optimism)</h2><p>One school never paid out their $5000 prize (thanks for nothing, UNBC!). </p><p>So with $10,000 in winnings to our name, we were ready to take on the world. </p><p>Along with our business plan competition spoils, I personally had $8,000 saved. </p><p><strong>I never considered getting a real job. </strong></p><p>I didn't jive with the dogma business school pushed on its impressionable young students. Recruiting events with a bunch of 20 year olds putting on suits to impress 23 year olds in suits for the privilege of making $40k/year working 80 hours a week. &nbsp;The weird reverence for McKinsey and KPMG. </p><p>I had some experience making my own money - running a window cleaning company that grossed $45k one summer - and once you've charged your friends out for $30/hr and paid them $15, it's hard to imagine working for anyone else. </p><p>The three of us were ready to build a hardware company. With $10,000. </p><p>A month after jumping into the abyss, we quickly realized we had no idea what we were doing and no money to do it with. The extent of our market validation was a few random people telling us our idea was good, and a prototype with some really decent software on it. </p><p>It took 3 months to realize it was never going to work. One engineer quit. </p><p>We were down to a partnership with no plan, no direction, no strategy, and no money. Yet, I still had a weird optimism that I'd figure it out. </p><p>I made $7,000 this year. </p><h2 id="year-2-survival-">Year 2 &nbsp;(survival)</h2><p>At the time, I was living in an amazing downtown apartment with two friends. </p><p>We squeezed 3 of us into a 2 bedroom + den apartment, on a grandfathered $2200/mo lease. My share was $800. </p><p>My friends all had real jobs at this point, but it never crossed my mind to get one. </p><p>I didn't want to move back home. I didn't want to get a job. I didn't even know what a job looked like (still don't!). </p><p>My only goals were to make that rent payment, drink a few beers, try to meet women, and eat. My business partner and I turned to what we knew. </p><p>Craigslist. </p><p>More specifically, web development on Craigslist. </p><p>We started building average Wordpress websites for small businesses, averaging $1000 to $4000 per month in sales from posting ads on Craigslist. </p><p>To supplement that kinglike income, we also started blogging on Seeking Alpha - writing stock investment advice for $80-$300 per article. </p><figure><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/296864-apples-future-is-in-the-icloud"><div><p>Stock Picks, Stock Market Investing</p><p><img src="https://seekingalpha.com/samw/static/images/favicon-192x192.png"><span>SeekingAlpha</span></p></div><p><img src="https://static3.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_192-59bfd51c9fe6af025b2f9f96c807e46f8e2f06c5ae787b15bf1423e6c676d4db.png"></p></a></figure><p>I had never bought a stock, and here I was - writing about Apple's future. </p><p>I should have bought Apple stock. </p><p>We shipped dozens of projects. </p><p>A website that paired up students and businesses, an events listing website, a Wordpress theme directory, a platform that helped companies pre-test job applicants skills, and many other forgotten ones. </p><p>The worst one was probably office composting. </p><p>Urban Dirt picked up your organic waste (in a rented Zipcar, as I didn't own a vehicle), and dropped it off at a composting facility for $30/week. </p><p>We got 10 customers for that business, and nearly landed the contract for Rogers Arena (Home of the Canucks) through a cold call. Hundreds of dollars of revenue wasn't enough, so we decided to make a huge bet on making our own fertilizer out of used coffee grounds from Starbucks. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 1140w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This image gives me shivers.</figcaption></figure><p>We spent weeks drying coffee grounds on homemade racks and packaging it in paper bags to sell at farmers markets. We sold $40 worth. </p><p>I rented my room out on AirBnB on the weekends and slept on my couch to make ends meet. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. </p><p>I made $30,000 in 2012. </p><h2 id="year-3-momentum-">Year 3 (momentum)</h2><p>To summarize - two years into my entrepreneurship journey I was somewhat scraping by building crappy websites for random businesses, blogging about stocks that I wasn't invested in, and slanging fertilizer. </p><p>Broke. </p><p>Depressed. </p><p>Yet, not ready to quit. </p><p>I don't remember the genesis, but one project we ended up building was an applicant tracking system. I'm sure I've told the story about how we wanted to hire for our web design agency and needed a way to track applicants so we built this software to solve our own problem. </p><p>That's a lie - our agency never hired anyone. We probably built that software because I saw it somewhere and it looked like something we could build. </p><p>Anyways, we built an applicant tracking system (it worked!) and I hustled my ass off to sign up customers. </p><p>A few companies (thanks Charlyne, Heidi, and Gord) believed in us enough to pay us a little bit of money for it. From there, we had a few more ideas around the recruitment space - again, likely borrowed. One idea was a really cool tool that helped asynchronously test out job applicants skills before they got hired. </p><p>Similar to Codility, but for everyone. </p><p>We couldn't get customers. People just wanted an applicant tracking system. </p><p>We tried to make that applicant tracking system sexier, by allowing companies to add pictures/videos of their companies to their job postings. Like Unbounce for your job postings. No one wanted it. </p><p>We got desperate. </p><p>To promote our product, we decided to host an online job fair. We dreamed up the idea for an online event where candidates could visit company "booths," chat with recruiters, and drop their resume. </p><p>We set a 6 week deadline to launch and promote it. </p><p>I hit the phones hard, and signed up 40 companies. My cofounder built the software. We got press in some of the countries' <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/bc-tech-fair-delivers-online-job-fair">biggest publications</a>. Thousands of candidates pre-registered for the event. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>We went live on 2pm on Monday, July 23rd. </p><p>Our servers crashed. </p><p>I punched a wall. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattfromlater">Matt</a> (who we were sharing an office space with) got our servers back up, and the site held together for a few hours. Overall it was a very average experience, but enough to get us on the radar of Growlab - Vancouver's version of YCombinator. </p><p>Growlab was a group of experienced entrepreneurs and mentors who invested $20,000 in startups with the goal of helping them raise more money. That online job fair got us on their radar, and we got into the program. </p><p>One minor issue - we had no idea what the fuck we were doing. </p><p>At this point we had 4 products in the market with a handful of users. </p><p>An applicant tracking system (~1k MRR) </p><p>Asyncronous skills testing (alpha product)</p><p>Unbounce for job postings (~50 users)</p><p>An online job fair platform (1 event) </p><p>We had no vision, and no direction. </p><p>Growlab invested $20,000. This was the most money I'd seen in a bank account in 3 years. If we met minimum criteria, the Business Development Bank of Canada would invest another $150,000 into the company after 3 months. &nbsp;</p><p>We decided to focus on KarmaHire - Unbounce for job postings. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1039w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It hurts my brain to think about trying to get that thing off the ground back then. </p><p>I tried everything. </p><p>Automatically creating job postings for companies on Indeed, and then sending them the postings. Cold calling from 7am to 8pm (on the damn PHONE). </p><p>I was under the gun, and nothing was working. </p><p>My stress levels were through the roof. I was telling a story every week to our investors that had a hint of truth to it, and failing to make that reality come true. </p><p>Unnamed mentor gave me some of the worst fucking advice I've gotten. </p><blockquote>"Never let the truth get in the way of a good story."</blockquote><p>I've always had a guilty conscience, and while by the letter of the law I was telling the truth - it hurt my soul to extrapolate tiny data points into a broad narrative. </p><p>My stress levels peaked one Wednesday in May. </p><p>I got to the office at 7am, ready to start cold-calling. I reached into my backpack and realized I forgot my laptop at home. </p><p>I cracked. </p><p>I stumbled out of the office in a daze, walking home with no regard for red lights or traffic laws. I nearly got hit by a car. Twice. </p><p>I was completely checked out. The only thing that brought me back to sanity was the fact that my Grandma picked up the phone when I called her. We talked about nothing of substance, but she told me she loved me. </p><p>I made it home and slept for 6 hours. And went back to work the next day. </p><p>We survived Growlab, and impressed the BDC enough to raise that $150,000. </p><p>It may have been the haircut more than the product. </p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgqK0Bi5lME?start=21&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The techiest of tech bros.</figcaption></figure><p>A lifeline, and a hint of validation. </p><p>Despite its challenges, Growlab accelerated my learning 10x.

December 30, 2020 | https://mdlayher.com/blog/unsafe-string-interning-in-go/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mdlayher.com/blog/unsafe-string-interning-in-go/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time datetime="2020-12-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">December 30, 2020</time></p><p>For a few months, I’ve been collaborating on the
<a href="https://inet.af/netaddr"><code>inet.af/netaddr</code></a> package for Go which introduces a
new <code>netaddr.IP</code> type as an alternative to the standard library’s
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/#IP"><code>net.IP</code></a> type. There are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/inet.af/netaddr#readme-motivation">a variety of reasons
for this</a>, but those are
not the focus of today’s blog.</p><p>The folks over at <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> have been working on
improving the performance of the package in various ways, including shrinking
the size of types and trying out faster internal IP representations.
Specifically, one topic that came up was <a href="https://github.com/inetaf/netaddr/pull/57">how to shrink <code>netaddr.IP</code> from 32
bytes to 24 bytes</a>, the same size
as a Go slice header.</p><p>Because a <code>netaddr.IP</code> can also have an associated zone for IPv6 link-local
addresses, the type previously contained a Go string, which occupies 16 bytes.
This is a good use case for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">string
interning</a>, a technique which
can be used to reduce the number of string allocations. It is highly likely that
a small number of zone identifiers will be used repeatedly throughout a program,
so string interning seems like a great fit for this problem.</p><p>In addition, another need for <code>netaddr.IP</code> is to guarantee that identical input
strings will also have identical backing data pointers in the intern pool. This
ensures that the input strings are usable internally as map keys, can occupy
less space in the pool, and can be used to occupy only one word of memory within
the type rather than two, as a Go string header would.</p><p>The result of this work is the package
<a href="https://go4.org/intern"><code>go4.org/intern</code></a> which uses some pretty neat <code>unsafe</code>
tricks to implement efficient string interning using weak references and Go
finalizers. We’ll start by showing off the safe implementation and gradually
introduce the concepts needed to understand the unsafe one as well.</p><p>All credit for the ideas and implementation of <code>go4.org/intern</code> goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_universetf">Dave
Anderson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/commaok">Josh Bleecher
Snyder</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a>. I simply watched the discussions
unfold on the issue tracker and thought that the code and the ideas behind it
were too interesting to not write up and share!</p><h2 id="safe-string-interning-in-go">Safe string interning in Go</h2><p>The basic idea of string interning is to retain a global pool of strings which
can be created or fetched on the fly, so that each string is allocated exactly
once for values which are identical. It’s worth noting that since our code will
accept empty <code>interface{}</code>, you could use it with any type which can be used as
a map key. This blog will focus on strings, but the same API could be used for
comparing the equality of a large struct type as well.</p><p>In its most basic form, you could implement <code>go4.org/intern</code> (with a caveat!) by
writing the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> intern

<span>// A Value pointer is the handle to an underlying comparable value.
</span><span>// See func Get for how Value pointers may be used.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Value <span>struct</span> {
	<span>// Enforce that Values cannot be used directly for equality comparisons.
</span><span></span>	<span>// We'll explain why a bit later.
</span><span></span>	_      [0]<span>func</span>()
	cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}
}

<span>// Get returns the comparable value passed to the Get func
</span><span>// that returned v.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> (v *Value) Get() <span>interface</span>{} { <span>return</span> v.cmpVal }

<span>// Our pool of interned values and a lock to serialize access.
</span><span></span><span>var</span> (
	mu      sync.Mutex
	val = <span>map</span>[<span>interface</span>{}]*Value{}
)

<span>// Get returns a pointer representing the comparable value cmpVal.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// The returned pointer will be the same for Get(v) and Get(v2)
</span><span>// if and only if v == v2, and can be used as a map key.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// Note that Get returns a *Value so we only return one word of data
</span><span>// to the caller, despite potentially storing a large amount of data
</span><span>// within the Value itself.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> Get(cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}) *Value {
	mu.Lock()
	<span>defer</span> mu.Unlock()

	v := val[cmpVal]
	<span>if</span> v != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// Value is already interned in the pool.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> v
	}

	<span>// Value must be created now and then interned.
</span><span></span>	v = &amp;Value{cmpVal: cmpVal}
	val[cmpVal] = v
	<span>return</span> v
}</code></pre></div><p>Usage of the package is straightforward at this point:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> TestBasics(t *testing.T) {
	foo := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)
	foo2 := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)

	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != foo2.Get() {
		t.Error(<span>"foo values differ"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != <span>"foo"</span> {
		t.Error(<span>"foo.Get not foo"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo != foo2 {
		t.Error(<span>"foo pointers differ"</span>)
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>The global pool in the library stored the string <code>"foo"</code> on the first call to
<code>intern.Get("foo")</code> and the same <code>*intern.Value</code> was returned and stored in both
<code>foo</code> and <code>foo2</code>.</p><p>However there is a caveat to this approach: the pool can never shrink. If we
keep adding more distinct values to the pool, it will continue to grow in size
and allocate more memory until our program eventually runs out of memory and
crashes. Even if we don’t add more values, we’ve still stranded some of our
memory for the entire duration of the program’s execution.</p><p>In fact, this is the tradeoff made by <code>go4.org/intern</code> for the “safe” operating
mode of the package. If you run your program with the environment variable
<code>GO4_INTERN_SAFE_BUT_LEAKY=true</code> then no unsafe tricks will be used, and the
intern pool will continue to grow as more items are added. For some programs,
this may be an acceptable tradeoff, but there’s much more to be discussed!</p><h2 id="breaking-the-unsafe-rules">Breaking the unsafe rules</h2><p>In order to make use of string interning while also cooperating with Go’s
garbage collector to remove and free unused values from the pool, it is
necessary to bend the package <code>unsafe</code> rules. This is what inspired me to author
this blog: I’ve written a lot of unsafe code in the past but have never
intentionally stepped outside the guard rails that the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer"><code>unsafe.Pointer</code> rules
provide for you</a>.</p><p>Specifically, we have to violate rule number 3:</p><blockquote><p>(3) Conversion of a Pointer to a uintptr and back, with arithmetic.</p><p>… Note that both [uintptr and unsafe.Pointer] conversions must appear in the
same expression, with only the intervening arithmetic between them:</p></blockquote><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// INVALID: uintptr cannot be stored in variable
</span><span>// before conversion back to Pointer.
</span><span></span>u := uintptr(p)
p = unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code></pre></div><p>In a hypothetical future version of Go, it is possible that the value stored at
the address pointed at by the <code>p</code> in the Go heap could be moved in between the
conversion and assignment <code>u := uintptr(p)</code> and the pointer arithmetic <code>p =
unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code>.</p><p>Because we are relying on the invariant that the Go garbage collector (as of Go
1.15) does not move data in the heap, <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a> came up with a clever pseudo-package
which users can underscore import if they intend to violate this particular
package <code>unsafe</code> rule:
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc"><code>go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc</code></a>.
If a program or its dependencies import this package and a future version of Go
uses a moving garbage collector which may rearrange items in the heap, the
package can be updated to fail compilation when the program’s behavior is now
invalid.</p><p>Technically, Go <em>does</em> have a moving garbage collector for its stacks as of Go
1.15. See <a href="https://github.com/go4org/unsafe-assume-no-moving-gc/issues/3">Matthew Dempsky’s issue for more
details</a>. Because
<code>go4.org/intern</code> stores values in a global map, the values will never be stack
allocated and thus this is not a problem for this particular use case.</p><p>Now that we’ve set the terms of engagement, it’s time to dive in to the unsafe
implementation.</p><h2 id="unsafe-string-interning-in-go">Unsafe string interning in Go</h2><p>We’ll be implementing the package <code>intern</code> code with the same API as before, but
with our newfound <code>unsafe</code> tricks and some <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer">Go runtime
finalizers</a> as well.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> intern

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="h.f0zdx2p8r8sq"><span>Writing my first Gameboy Emulator</span></p><p><span>Okay so today’s post might be a bit of a cheat because I’m nowhere near complete on this project. But I’m really excited, because I just got the Tetris title screen working!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O9JwbvM5phtNcpgBj_2Un5C3QWVLTn24SWN43trTYG7ryH4enLNU6vbMzqMYwridlrhT8HswNBQNVUk19vTe87fsSwvJf0W-IsUEx6j8u13I1zKrktnzabBUzOf3lZcNor0lvGxV" title=""></span></p><p><span>This is the first time I’ve worked on an emulator and </span><span>oh boy</span><span>&nbsp;do I regret taking this long to get around to it. This has been one of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on. Not only do I feel like I’m truly gaining a more fundamental understanding of the internals of a machine (which is sort of the point), but it is SO exciting suddenly seeing someone else’s software pop up on the screen.</span></p><p><span>I’m still working on this journey myself but I thought I’d share what I’ve done so far to hopefully encourage others to give this a go.</span></p><p><span>It all started with the bootrom. The gameboy didn’t have an operating system. It simply had a simple bootrom that showed you that famous Nintendo logo (which is actually </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cUIGHZLGA">a novel DRM scheme</a></span><span>). It’s a very simple program that you can read line by line making it pretty easy to work out where I was going wrong. I started by making a “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a></span><span>” which was just a big ol switch statement going through </span><span><a href="https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/">each opcode</a></span><span>. This is definitely the most labour intensive part of the project. There are a lot of opcodes.</span></p><p><span>What you quickly discover while implementing opcodes is that the gameboy memory is basically just an array. So next I created registers and an “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">MMU</a></span><span>” (the gameboy didn’t really have an MMU but this made things easier to manage). After around four days, I had the Nintendo logo rendering!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xRho4Dq1Fo1vUdM6BNTShSDwfBupG_CSlcrlkG2m9MhC_O75h1T1krLYA16RbOXUSH0BO-W_6u-2B6opnDkgzO3BYHmHJLxgrWbaPEJfbhumMPHAZp0acPT2iL_86tIv3zCLl6DB" title=""></span></p><p><span>Simple rendering is pretty straightforward. The Gameboy would write to a certain region of memory reserved for video so all you need to do is read from there to know what you should render. Once I got that far - I was completely hooked. My approach of just implementing more and more Gameboy hardware was working.</span></p><p><span>There are already a ton of resources that go into far more detail:</span></p><ul><li><span><a href="http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html">http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html</a></span></li><li><span><a href="http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU">http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/">https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/</a></span></li></ul><p><span>If you have the time and you’re interested, I would strongly suggest you give this project a go.

<div id="post-body"><p>I have recently bought an e-book by a <a href="https://gumroad.com/dellannaluca">Gumroad author</a> named <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca">Luca Dellana</a>. I have to admit I did it mainly to see how successful authors on Gumroad package their offerings. I was initially skeptical about the book, dismissing it as just another attempt to capitalize on the self-help trend. As I kept reading, however, I found a few clever references washing away my initial skepticism. One quote in particular, stuck in my mind, and I cannot seem to stop thinking about it: </p><blockquote>"If you think about it, the very important never feels urgent. Instead, <strong>most things which feel urgent are important <em>for someone else</em>, not for you."</strong></blockquote><p>Something so simple and yet so difficult to put through common sense. Modern life is full of urgency - from the moment we wake up to the time we go back to bed. Things coming from different directions, fighting for our undivided attention, non-stop.</p><p>The key is this. We acknowledge the presence of <strong>urgency</strong>, however, most of us wrongly attribute <strong>importance</strong> to it, putting the actually important stuff aside. In reality, things that matter usually become urgent when it is too late. In most other times, they are important for someone else, not for us.</p><p>Think about that project at work that so badly needed to be finished before the holidays. It must have brought a ton of pressure to you and your team, hasn't it? Yet, chances are, you would hardly remember it on your deathbed. Neither will your boss or their boss, either. The only person for whom it makes any difference is the one who created the business. If that is not you, I have news - you need to shift your focus. Start with your family and friends, for example. Or your health and passion. The kinds of things you always thought you would resort to doing someday, once you become rich and retired.</p><p>Do them now, instead of when it gets too late.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>«If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, it will protect all of you.»<br>
<em>Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I like the quotation above. It’s a powerful statement and one of the reasons why I am not concerned when I hear positions I deeply detest. Well, as long as they are detested by society as well. Because if these people are heard, we just might have something similar to freedom of speech (we don’t have that first amendment in Germany).</p>
<p>But, damn, it’s not easy to listen to positions you don’t like.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded of that issue when I tried to listen to a “<a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast/culture-wars-with-andrew-doyle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Wars with Andrew Doyle</a>” episode, <a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast-episode/the-misogyny-of-trans-activism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in which he had Julie Bindel as a guest</a>. She’s a feminist, lesbian, and judging by what I have heard of her, does not like men very much. It’s all patriarchy, men &amp; violence, the whole narrative. At least that how that episode appeared to me.</p>
<p>And after less than half of the episode, I had enough.</p>
<p>I might agree with (part of) her criticism of trans-activists, but the way she talks about men — damn, she appeared to have been stuck in the past. Or rather, in an extremely antiquated view of men. It’s strange how in many other areas we talk about the overlap between men and women being greater than the differences (not in physical strength, but you get the idea), but when it comes to power somehow we are talking about two distinct populations.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>That stick-in-the-mud perspective lost its appeal years ago. Just look at the number of homeless, suicides (actual, not attempts), murders, and much, much more. And sure, when it comes to murder, most of the murderers might me male, but would you really care about the sex of the murderer when you get murdered? I wouldn’t. I found her attitude appalling. And I am — again — very glad I am not a woman. If I had people like her ostensibly speak for me … I’d be mad as hell. Like when it comes to what makes a woman, or whether sex work is demeaning. Seriously? Why not let each person decide for <em>themselves</em> what the fuck that means and how they see that work?</p>
<p>I thought people — and that includes women — should decide for themselves?</p>
<p>And yeah, on another level, it was really funny (for a part of me) to hear that all those <em>unfair</em> strategies, all this emotional reasoning feminists used against men (and women who disagreed), is now used by trans-activists against feminists.</p>
<p>You’ve made your bed, you’ve used those strategies, now how do you like them apples?</p>
<p>But yeah, I take no pleasure in watching the world burn. So no, I don’t really take pleasure from seeing those kind of feminists tasting their own medicine. But even so, I found her views so appalling that I stopped listening. Which I also found interesting. I thought of myself as someone who is willing to differing perspectives, but I guess I found my limits.</p>
<p>And that is actually something valuable I will take from this “conversation”, well listening to that podcast: Nobody listens to you if you disparage their person, no matter how much they might agree with your point.</p>
<p>So, it was <em>surprisingly educating</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p><em>This is the fourth installment of my “year in review” series. 
For a recap, here’s <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">2019</a>,
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-years/">2018</a> 
and <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/the-year-everything-changed/">2017</a>.</em></p>

<p>2020 was my fourth year of building my own internet businesses.
Like everyone else, my 2020 did <em>not</em> go according to plan.
And yet, things worked out in the end.</p>

<p>It was a year of big swings: starting with a taste of celebrity—followed by 
the collapse of my biggest business—and closing with record-breaking success.
Eventually I ended up almost exactly where I planned,
only the route was totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap of my 2020 in nine pictures.</p>

<h4 id="january-officially-an-indie-hacker">January: officially an Indie Hacker!</h4>

<p>In January, I met and recorded a podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/csallen">Courtland Allen</a>,
founder of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> and a hero of mine. 
When <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/147-cory-zue-of-place-card-me">the podcast aired</a>,
I had a tiny taste of celebrity, hearing from people throughout the Twitter-verse
who were inspired by my story.
It was the most fun moment of my Indie Hacking career.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/first-subscription/me-and-courtland.jpg" alt="Meeting Courtland Allen"></p>

<p>Me and Courtland Allen in his Cape Town Airbnb. January, 2020.</p>

<p>Courtland also convinced me to double down on my <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">wedding place card app</a>—called Place Card Me—leading
to <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/first-subscription/">my first ever subscription revenue online</a>.</p>

<p>The year was looking good!</p>

<h4 id="march-the-pandemic-shakes-things-up">March: the pandemic shakes things up</h4>

<p>Fast forward to mid-March, and the world decided to take Covid-19 very seriously, very fast.</p>

<p>Place Card Me—my primary side-business—saw its revenue plummet to $0 almost overnight.
Not seeing a way to pivot, I decided to pause work on the project indefinitely—now
9 months and counting—and shift my focus to <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Pegasus, my Django boilerplate for SaaS apps</a>.
Sorry, Courtland!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/place-card-me-5-weeks-corona.png" alt="Place Card Me Revenue Feb-March"></p>

<p>Place Card Me’s revenue, late Feb - April 1. It has sinced picked up a bit, but remains
well off 2019’s numbers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Africa—where I live—introduced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world,
including banning alcohol sales and disallowing outdoor exercise.
I had to resort to running in circles around my flat.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/lockdown-run.png" alt="Lockdown Run"></p>

<p>My lockdown running route. Hundreds of circles around my small flat. March, 2020.</p>

<p>The lockdown also took away our childcare, so my wife and I split the work day in half.
My productive hours ended at noon, most of my time went to my day job,
and my side-businesses languished.</p>

<h4 id="may-my-first-record-breaking-month-of-the-year">May: my first record-breaking month of the year</h4>

<p>In May we got childcare back and for the first time in months I had time for proactive work.</p>

<p>I started by <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/may-2020/">experimenting with some pricing changes</a> 
leading to Pegasus earning over $4,000—more than any of my products had ever earned in a single month.
I had to re-do the axes on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open">side-project dashboard</a>—where I track
my product revenue and effort—to accommodate the new high.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/pegasus-y-axis.png" alt="Pegasus Breaking the Chart"></p>

<p>Pegasus income breaks the chart on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side project dashboard</a>. May, 2020.</p>

<h4 id="july-august-distractions-and-failure">July-August: distractions and failure</h4>

<p>July and August saw my biggest divergence of the year.</p>

<p>Thinking it would be a good opportunity to exercise Pegasus, I decided to build and launch
a new product to provide <a href="https://repostory.app/">code review analytics for Github repositories</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, before I finished MVP I realized the project was too ambitious for the 
amount of time I was willing to devote to it.
So, following a lackluster launch, and seeing a long road ahead, 
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/aug-2020/">I decided to stop working on it indefinitely</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/repostory-social.png" alt="RepoStory"></p>

<p>RepoStory: my failed experiment building code review analytics product, launched to no one in August.</p>

<p>I still think the project has potential, but for now it’s lying idle.</p>

<h4 id="september-hello-world">September: hello world!</h4>

<p>September marked the arrival of our new son Victor into the world.
I learned that <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/new-parent-again/">being a parent is easier the second time around</a>—except
for the <em>other</em> kid.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/new-parent-again/victor-sleep.jpg" alt="Hello Victor"></p>

<p>Our new son Victor, born September 7, 2020.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on paternity leave I stumbled upon a diagram labeled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">Ikigai</a>—that 
I later learned was <em>not</em> Ikigai—that made me question about my chosen career.</p>

<p>Specifically, I felt like I was doing well with everything <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/ikigai/">except possibly “what the world needs”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/not-ikigai.jpg" alt="Not Ikigai"></p>

<p>This diagram, often attributed as the Japanese concept of Ikigai, was actually
created by <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmograma">Andrés Zuzunaga</a>.</p>

<p>So, I devoted a chunk of the last three months of the year to trying to explore the topic of a “meaningful” life
and career more seriously.</p>

<p>But, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/how-to-save-the-world/">turns out this is hard</a>!</p>

<p>I’ll let you know if I figure it out.</p>

<h4 id="november-another-record-breaking-month">November: another record-breaking month</h4>

<p>Back on the business-side of things, at the end of November, I ran an impulse Black Friday sale,
leading to another record-breaking month for Pegasus and 
me—outstripping my previous monthly high by almost $3,000.</p>

<p>The massive spike from the Pegasus Black Friday sale. November, 2020.</p>

<p>A couple weeks later, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/black-friday/">my write-up on the sale</a> made 
the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, resulting in about 10,000
visitors to my website and leading to another few Pegasus sales.</p>

<p>After the whole saga, I was suddenly within reach of my 2020 profit target of $42k that
I’d all-but abandoned post-Covid.</p>

<h4 id="december-rr">December: R&amp;R</h4>

<p>Finally, rounding out the year amidst another Covid surge and lockdown in South Africa
with the family and some time off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/family-holidays.jpg" alt="Family Holidays"></p>

<p>While alcohol sales are again closed in South Africa, at least the national parks are open. December, 2020.</p>

<h2 id="profits">Profits</h2>

<p>When all was said and done, <strong>total profits on the year from personal projects came in just over $43,000</strong>—or
about $1k higher than <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">my goal set in January</a>.
Given how hard the pandemic hit Place Card Me, I’m quite proud to have still hit that target.</p>

<p>Here’s the last four years of product income—broken out by product.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/profits-by-year.png" alt="Profits by year"></p>

<p>Annual profits by product. Now available on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side-project dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Place Card Me ended up down about 42% on the year, but Pegasus more than made up for it,
growing from $4,000 to almost $30,000 in a single year—or about <em>double</em> 
what I had forecasted at the start of the year.</p>

<p>More on this later.</p>

<h2 id="time-spend">Time spend</h2>

<p>I logged just under 2,000 hours this year. 
This works out almost exactly to a standard 40-hour-a-week, 52-week work-year,
which makes it easier to think about the time distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/2020-time.png" alt="2020 time"></p>

<p>In terms of a calendar year breakdown, about four months went to my day job at Dimagi,
three months went to Pegasus, six weeks went to email and writing,
another five weeks went to exercise(!), and then the rest fell into smaller buckets.</p>

<p>I’m happy with this breakdown, though I would prefer if the amount of “day job” time was a bit
less and the amount of “exploration” time was a bit more.
Something to think about for 2021.</p>

<p>Speaking of which…</p>

<h2 id="the-year-ahead">The year ahead</h2>

<p>If 2020 was the year of Pegasus then 2021 will be the year of…well…also Pegasus.</p>

<p>Yep, for the third year running, <strong>I’m planning for Pegasus to be my main hustle</strong>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><em>Because it still feels like Pegasus is in its first act</em>.</p>

<p>A year into Place Card Me the product felt basically complete.
I could add features, improve marketing, etc. but there weren’t any easy ways to grow it without 
fundamentally changing the product in some way.
Place Card Me made place cards well. Where do you go from there?</p>

<p>Pegasus on the other hand, seems to have limitless possibility.
The core product itself can continue getting better, with lots of features to add and improvements to 
make—some of which are already in flight. Plus, it’s fun as hell.</p>

<p>But even Pegasus itself is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Could Pegasus have a plug-in marketplace where other developers can earn money extending it?
Could Pegasus have a jobs board to connect Django developers to my customers who need help on their projects?
Could Pegasus offer Django courses or books?
Or a hosted way to deploy your Django apps to the cloud?</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/183-chris-oliver-of-gorails">Chris Oliver has done for Ruby on Rails</a>, 
there appear to be an infinite amount of Pegasus-adjacent opportunities to create new products, offerings,
and build out the Pegasus ecosystem—all of which are aligned with each other.</p>

<p>So yeah. Already my most profitable product by a lot and still in act one.
Hopefully exciting times ahead!</p>

<h2 id="2021-targets">2021 Targets</h2>

<p>The other big decision I’ve made about 2021 is that it’s time to flip the narrative 
of what I’ve been doing.</p>

<p>For the last four years I’ve thought of myself as a professional developer/freelancer who also played around
on the internet trying to make money from side-hustles.</p>

<p>But barring an unexpected turn of events—<em>I expect 2021 to be the first year I make
the majority of my income from my own businesses</em>.
A change I hope just might hold for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>the side hustles have become the main hustle.</em>
<strong>I’m no longer a <em>side-project</em> entrepreneur. I’m a mother-fucking <em>real entrepreneur</em>.</strong></p>

<p>So, here are my targets for 2020:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Earn $65k Profit from personal projects.</li>
  <li>Spend the majority of my time working for myself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to own this thing!
I’m looking forward to it.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Societies have long valued information control but methods of control have changed over time. What systems drive these changes? And where do undesirable outcomes occur?</p>
<p>Using any of these methods doesn’t imply bad intentions. In some cases, there are good reasons for wanting to control information. But if we’re thinking only of intentions, we’ll lose our focus on outcomes. <strong><a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/morals-of-the-moment/">Good intentions</a> can lead us down bad pathways</strong>.</p>
<p>Four major types of control information are destruction, banning, debauching, and blocking.</p>
<p>These methods are applied to recorded information as well as what we carry in our memories and pass down verbally.</p>
<p>And why do I care about this?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types.png" alt="" width="550" height="271" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types.png 876w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types-300x148.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types-768x378.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><span id="more-2793"></span></p>
<h2>Destroy</h2>
<p>When we think of the topic of information control, we might naturally think of destruction. But <strong>destruction is a small part</strong> of this issue today.</p>
<p>Many of the best examples of destruction are from long ago.</p>
<p>China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, ordered the burning of books (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars">213 BC</a>) that existed before his reign so that he could not be compared with times of the past. As the Qin emperor’s chancellor is recorded as saying: <em>“Anyone who uses history to criticize the present shall have his family executed.”</em> The Qin emperor did however allow books on certain topics to survive, including&nbsp; agriculture and medicine.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a> (the erasure of specific villains from history) served both as punishment and to prevent others from committing similar acts.</p>
<p>Note that destroying information was more possible in the past. When much information was handwritten, not easily replicable or distributed, and in limited quantities, outright destruction was a serious option. Destruction became less of an option after the development of the printing press, online distribution and historical backups, and more.</p>
<h2>Ban</h2>
<p><strong>Banning often comes from a entity’s decision that certain information is contrary to their aims</strong>. Information may be banned because it is bad for morals, is believed to create bad feelings, may harm the people who should be protected from it, or may harm the group banning it.</p>
<p>Books form some of the better known types of banned content. There are too many banned books to list.</p>
<p>Germany in the leadup to WWII started to burn and ban books and other works of art, building a “list of harmful and undesirable literature” with <a href="https://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/berlin-im-nationalsozialismus/verbannte-buecher/#headline_1_2">4,500 works</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the more famous books banned at one time in the US (with their reasons) include: <em>Brave New World</em> (sex, drugs, morals), <em>Animal Farm</em> (politics on multiple sides), <em>Catch-22</em> (profanity), <em>Of Mice and Men</em> (profanity, racial slurs), <em>Lord of the Flies</em> (morals, racism), <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> (sex, profanity, morals), <em>Invisible Man</em> (sex), <em>Satanic Verses</em> (blasphemy).</p>
<p>Bans also depend on timing. The Catholic Church (in an era of weakness due to the Protestant Reformation) banned Galileo’s works on the heliocentric solar system, but not Copernicus’ supporting work that predated it (in an era of a strong church).</p>
<p>In <em>The Republic </em>Plato even concerns himself in which types of music to ban. A dialogue in Book III outlines the types of music that should be allowed in an ideal city. Ban the dirges, ballads, and drinking songs; keep the marches.</p>
<p>A ban keeps information out, whether from a geographic area, an age group, a religious group, or political one. Bans don’t affect the existence of that information or its presence in other groups. <strong>The groups enforcing the ban are typically open about their reasons</strong>.</p>
<h2>Block</h2>
<p><strong>Groups understand the risk of allowing certain information to flow.</strong> Blocking is a more sophisticated version of banning. Where you might make a list of books that are to be banned, you never could do the same with the volume of user generated content created today.</p>
<p>Examples of blocking includes censorship during wartime. The lack of censorship in Spain (neutral during WWI) is why even today we refer the 1918 flu pandemic as the “Spanish Flu.” Spain was one of the few countries with reporting on the new disease.</p>
<p>Wartime censorship was also on an individual basis, scanning letters to prevent the flow of sensitive information. This exchange on WWII censorship from <em>Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! by </em>Richard Feynman shows how it sometimes worked:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Next day I get a letter from my wife that says, ‘It’s very difficult writing because I feel that the _____ is looking over my shoulder.’ And where the word was there is a splotch made with ink eradicator.<br>
“So I went down to the bureau, and I said, ‘You’re not supposed to touch the incoming mail if you don’t like it. You can look at it, but you’re not supposed to take anything out.’<br>
“They said, ‘Don’t be ridiculous. Do you think that’s the way censors work — with ink eradicator? They cut things out with scissors.’<br>
“I said OK. So I wrote a letter back to my wife and said, ‘Did you use ink eradicator in your letter?’ She writes back, ‘No, I didn’t use ink eradicator in my letter, it must have been the _____’ and there’s a hole cut out of the paper.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But today there are also subtler means of blocking, for example pushing information down to page two of Google, releasing information on a holiday when there will be a little attention or, as Youtube is now doing, blocking content related to <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election">election fraud</a>.</p>
<p>The largest public version of this is China’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">Great Firewall</a>, which blocks specific external sites and user-generated content.</p>
<p>Blocked information, when known, can also backfire. Those blocked Trump tweets related to the election may have caused more people to believe them than <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-social-media-fact-check-farce-11606519380?mod=e2two">otherwise</a>.</p>
<p>Blocking can also be self-propagating. When people learn what information will be blocked, they may self-censor themselves both in posting about it and searching for it.</p>
<h2>Debauch</h2>
<p><strong>Information debauch sets out to change the information for a specific purpose.</strong> Perhaps in our modern belief in openness, this technique has become more common.</p>
<p>The purpose could be to harm a opponent, for example by exaggerating a quote taken out of context or preventing specific information from reaching an audience by altering it. I’ve written about <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/prester-john-and-the-long-history-of-disinformation/">disinformation</a> variations of this.</p>
<p>There are different types of information debauch. One is the Cardinal Richelieu style of inventing a crime in anything (<em>“If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged”</em>). The other is to <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-clip/">select an out-of-context clip</a> of a longer conversation when it agrees with your worldview (unintentional debauch) or supports your argument (intentional debauch).</p>
<p>The intentional misrepresentation of quotes fascinates me. People can go back to the primary source to see that the misquote is actually misleading, but few actually do that.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this related to Trump, both from him and targeted against him. To choose one of the more bizarre examples, debauched information led many people to believe that Trump recommended injecting or drinking bleach to treat COVID <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/11/joe-biden/no-trump-didnt-tell-americans-infected-coronavirus/">when he didn’t</a> (the light mentioned was apparently <a href="https://aytubio.com/healight/">this</a>). Few people view the original video or quotes in their entirety rather than only the retold story. When something is odd but believable, people will pass it along.</p>
<p><strong>You should not want debauched information even if it helps your side.</strong> Information debauch can be used in any direction. Making it a norm hurts the entire system.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I’ve written about information and how we use it multiple times on this site, in <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/question-of-timing/">A Question of Timing</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/disinformation-and-disease-coronavirus-edition/">Disinformation and Disease</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/prester-john-and-the-long-history-of-disinformation/">Prester John and the Long History of Disinformation</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">Acquiring Ignorance</a>, and other posts.</p>
<p>What unintended consequences can flow from each of these types of information control?</p>
<ul>
<li>Destroying: The loss of the information itself, historical value, missed links in human thought.</li>
<li>Banning: Possibly drawing more attention to the information than otherwise, bans can be found for contrary reasons.</li>
<li>Blocking: Does the controlling entity choose well?</li>
<li>Debauching: This technique brings doubt into other information, can be used in any direction, sows confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Controlling the flow and accuracy of information has long been essential. We are just in a stage of the world where information can flow fast and far and yet still be controlled in ways described above.</p>

<h2>Joy of Lisp.</h2>

<p>Ten years ago myself, Ray McDermott and Kristof Sajdak fell in love with functional programming; we marveled at its ease of expression, simplicity, and immutable data structures.</p>

<p>After reading the now classic <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf" title="[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, this only made functional programming more attractive.  It seemed to be what we had been missing in the typical enterprise landscape, which at that time, was full of Java and .Net. It was a literal <em>where have you been all my life</em> moment as the beauty of it struck a chord with all of us.</p>

<p>From there, we never looked back – with our eyes now wide open, we had seen the promise of the future, and the current languages just wouldn’t cut it any longer.  Outside of our world, other factors that contributed to functional languages’ perfect timing for emergence included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moore’s Law was topping out</li>
<li>Lower cost multi-core CPUs were now mainstream</li>
<li>Parallel architectures were appearing, and</li>
<li>Jaded developers, were frustrated with their languages</li>
</ul>

<p>Martin Odersky’s Scala programming language was the subject of significant press attention and turned many people like us onto the possibility of using functional programming for the enterprise, but it wasn’t quite right, it was’t a Lisp.</p>

<h2>Hello Clojure.</h2>

<pre><code>(ns hello-clojure.core)
(defn -main [&amp; args]
    (println "Hello, Clojure!"=))
</code>
</pre>

<p>Around this same period, Rich Hickey’s Clojure came to our attention, with the simplicity of Lisp, a REPL, immutability and, critically, first-class host language interop. With Interop, we were no longer in a walled garden that restricted so many other, purer implementations. Rich’s pragmatic choices and the resultant capabilities of Clojure ticked all the boxes. It also seemed to do the impossible: re-invigorating and exciting the development teams.</p>

<p>We started using Clojure where we could and where it proved viable.  Areas where we identified uses were primarily in applications where there was little or no existing code in place and no overriding requirement to adhere to a corporate standard. No going back now, we were all in.</p>

<h2>Enter ClojureScript.</h2>

<pre><code>
(ns todomvc.views
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent]
            [re-frame.core :refer [subscribe dispatch]]
            [clojure.string :as str]))
</code>
</pre>

<p>ClojureScript goes everywhere; it can get to places that Clojure can’t go. It does this by piggybacking on the reach claim from JavaScript, and we can keep it functional.</p>

<p>We want our product to be able to reach any possible location, inside a car key fob, IoT devices, smart homes, and cities. ClojureScript is now mature enough to use everywhere, but it wasn’t always this way of course.</p>

<p>Looking back to 2010, I wanted to go way more mobile, and I had a desire to make the companies’ tech more ubiquitous for it to be deployed on iOS/Android/Tractors/Cars and we couldn’t do this in a functional programming way. Ray was using Clojure on Cloud PaaS and Web, continuing to leverage the JVM and Clojure to achieve great things.  Kristof and I worked on making connected cars “Restful” and idempotent, and JavaScript &amp; JSON made that happen for us; there just wasn’t a way to do this with functional programming.</p>

<p>As good as Clojure was we couldn’t use it where we wanted and felt like it was a vast chasm to cross for the reach that we desired to become a reality.</p>

<p>What we didn’t know then is that two future members of our team where actively solving this problem.</p>

<p>Mike Fikes built <a href="https://github.com/mfikes/goby" title="Goby" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goby</a>, a hybrid iOS app technology using ClojureScript and Objective-C and released it into the App Store. I understand that Facebook’s Lee Byron saw this, and it probably inspired Facebook towards going in this direction. Coincidently, David Nolen was asked by Facebook to speak at the React.JS conference around the same time. This led to both Mike and David being granted access to the React Native Github repository, which was closed to the public as it was still alpha.  Subsequently, Mike became the first person to get <a href="https://twitter.com/mfikes/status/573918846890938368?lang=en" title="ClojureScript working with React Native" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript working with React Native.</a></p>

<p>Separately &amp; together Mike and David worked on projects such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/" title="Om" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Om</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mfikes/ambly" title="Ambly" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ambly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/replete-repl/replete-ios" title="Replete" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replete</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/planck-repl/planck" title="Planck" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planck</a></li>
<li>and of course the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript" title="ClojureScript" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript</a> compiler itself</li>
</ul>

<p>They blazed a trail that we now take for granted.</p>

<p>We came into Vouch with a long-held belief of consuming technology where no competitive advantage was needed and where differentiation is not a critical factor; this allows us to move quickly without us needing to become experts in commodity technologies.</p>
<p>Therefore we stand on the shoulders of many industry giants. Examples of this would be <a href="https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel" title="Figwheel" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figwheel</a>, created by Bruce Hauman, which has revolutionized the way we build UI, and Blockchain, and provided a way to create absolute trust.  To make our platform work with these great technologies, we needed flexibility and modularity for our technology.</p>

<p>Our approach has always been to use the right tool for the right job, first and foremost, it just so happens that that has been ClojureScript.</p>

<h2>Attracting World-Class Talent.</h2>

<p>We started Vouch with a core team, myself, Ray and Kristof, who had worked together for many years before Vouch.  We quickly came to a point where we needed to expand the development team with skilled engineers who shared our vision and passion for building the company we wanted to create.</p>

<p>A company’s product vision, culture, and outcomes are not the only considerations for attracting world-class engineers to join a team; technology choices are just as critical, which has been one of my maxims for success over the years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Great people want to work on great teams using great technologies, to build great products.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While our team shares a common interest in Clojure/ClojureScript, more importantly, we all wanted to work within a great team, using great technologies, to build great products.</p>

<p>The team is growing and attracting seriously world-class talent faster than we can onboard them.  It might just be the best problem I have ever had to solve for. Recently Mike commented, <em>“Wouldn’t it be great if we could build a team that could make all the tools we wanted to use to develop our products?”,</em> I could not have agreed more.</p>

<h2>Community.</h2>

<p>The Vouch team began getting deeper into the  Clojure community by first attending and then speaking at conferences. Ray started to host the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/defn-771544745" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a>  podcast, which led to an introduction and later joining of Mike Fikes to the Vouch team.  Mike then introduced David Nolen who subsequently joined the team.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is here to stay, loved by the team and obviously, we have David and Mike who are the lead committers of the language and compiler respectively.  Ray hosts the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/defn" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a> podcast and also started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UxEQuBvfLJgWR5tk_XIXA" title="Apropos" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apropos</a>. Our team speaks publicly and regularly at ClojureScript or related conferences. We invest in this language, we craft solutions using its strengths, we speak publicly about it, we educate people about it and most of all, we care for it.</p>

<h2>So are we actually betting the company on ClojureScript?</h2>

<p>In just 18 months with a small but highly skilled team, we have been able to conceive of, prototype, design, build and implement a breakthrough product that we believe will fundamentally alter the way that people, devices, software and processes interact digitally based on improving trust between those parties. I can honestly say that ClojureScript has been a substantial contributing factor to making this possible and in many ways, our product has become a poster child for the language.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is one of the most valuable tools available to us, and we use it where it makes sense to do so.  I’m not sure if we even consider this as a bet, but if it is, then it’s the safest bet we will ever make.</p>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

Therefore, the only sensible bet is to believe in God. This has come to be known as <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-pascals-wager-is-eminently-modern" target="_blank">Pascal’s wager</a>.</p><p>It has a surprising number of applications beyond concerns for a comfortable afterlife. There are many things for which the value of believing something or not can be seen as a cost-versus-likely-benefit wager,&nbsp;often without regard to the actual truth of the matter. Since science does not profess to have a final truth, and in many areas freely admits its incomplete knowledge, Pascal’s wager can provide a useful method of deciding between two alternatives.</p><blockquote><p>All drugs and treatments have side effects, but vaccines in general have the fewest.</p> </blockquote><p>For example, it seems that a significant percentage of the population is suspicious of science, or so we are told. We often hear that some large number, approaching or exceeding half of Americans, do not believe in evolution. This seems remarkable on the face of it because there is no viable scientific opposition to evolution and it is widely accepted by biologists and other life scientists as being fundamental to understanding biology—from genetics to medicine.<br></p><p>What we are not often told is that most of those who answer negatively about believing in evolution nonetheless understand evolution—or at least the basics of it. They are not stupid, ignorant, or uninformed. They have simply made a Pascalian wager. What benefit, we might ask, is derived from believing in evolution rather than a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/how-to-weed-creationism-out-of-schools" target="_blank">divine creation</a>? Unless you are a professional biologist, it is hard to see how this would affect your everyday life. On the other hand, professing a belief in Darwinian evolution over the biblical narrative will likely ostracize you from family, friends, co-workers, your church community—in short most of your social infrastructure. Place your bets.</p><p>Can we apply any of this to decisions over the current controversy surrounding vaccination—and in particular the newly arrived COVID-19 vaccine?</p><p>There are certainly reasons to be concerned about being vaccinated, and it would be a gross over-simplification to consider anyone who expresses reticence about taking a vaccine, this new vaccine in particular, as being just plain dumb or scientifically illiterate or gullible. They need be none of these things and still may be suspicious of the vaccine.<br></p><p>One issue is safety. The vaccine, any vaccine, is designed to mobilize your immune system, essentially to fool it into believing that there is an invading virus present and to mount an immune response. That way it will be ready when the real invasion comes, if it comes. This seems pretty sensible and preferable to going to war with an opponent you know nothing about. But still, it is fooling around with Mother Nature and some people are uneasy about that. Although it must be pointed out that the virus is not at all shy about fooling around with your immune system and many other parts of you, so letting it have its way is not good policy, either.</p><p>What about a vaccine made of genes? This vaccine is being produced by what is being touted as a new method using RNA—genes. While it is true that for entirely economic reasons, this is the first vaccine to be produced in this way, the method is not really new and the science that makes it possible has been developing over the last 40 years. So it’s not so radical as the press makes it seem.&nbsp;</p><p>But it is true that this method uses RNA, genetic material, to make the vaccine. We hear a lot about gene modification and the potential dangers associated with it. Why then am I going to allow RNA, genes, to be injected into me? The first thing to realize is that this is exactly what the virus does—so whether you get a vaccine or an infection, you are getting genes injected into you. The virus RNA encodes around 12 functional genes (by comparison humans and other mammals have around 25,000 genes). The virus only contains the genes to make a new virus—it does not have any of the capabilities of a normal cell to actually turn those genes into the proteins that make up the complete virus. It hijacks your cells to do this—and that’s how it sickens you, by forcing your cells to make new viruses instead of what they should be doing.</p><blockquote><p>Vaccines have fewer side effects than virtually any other drug you wouldn’t even think twice about taking.</p> </blockquote><p>Now the new vaccines have taken just one of those genes—the one that directs the production of the now infamous spike protein that appears on the surface of a normal virus—and injects just that one gene into your muscle cells, which then make that one single protein. Your immune system comes along and sees that weird protein and makes antibodies to it. These same antibodies will now recognize the spike protein on the surface of any viral particles that invade your body. We have effectively turned the virus into its own enemy.</p><p>The viral RNA that you are getting will decompose over a few days because RNA is not a stable molecule (that, by the way, is why the vaccine needs to be kept frozen) and it will no longer exist in your body. It could only become a permanent part of your genome if it were a DNA molecule instead of an RNA molecule—and even the chances of that happening would be chemically remote. So regardless of how it sounds, this may actually be the safest sort of vaccine to use. In the future it is likely that all vaccines will be made this way.</p><p><span>T</span>hen, of course, there is the issue of who is running this whole vaccine program—the government and the pharmaceutical industry. These are the guys who brought you opioid addiction, death by Vioxx, soaring drug prices, the worst health-care system in the developed world, regulations where you don’t need them and none where you do—am I really going to trust this cast of so-called “inept villains,” as some believe, to dictate my personal health choices? Do we know for sure that the claims of efficacy are real or just made up to sell some worthless procedure? It would not be the first time. (I would not, on the other hand, worry about Bill Gates having a chip inserted into you along with the vaccine—if you use any social media, navigational tools, or purchase anything online, then Bill Gates already knows more about you than he will get from any injectable chip. So that train has left the station.)</p><p>All this and a few lesser issues are worth a pause, for sure. But we must also look on the positive side of the ledger. Why trust science? Modern medicine and the science behind it has eliminated or dramatically lessened such scourges as smallpox, polio, cholera, chicken pox, measles, rabies, and dozens of other killer pathogens that had previously wiped out enormous numbers of people, in some cases significant parts of entire generations. Don’t we depend on science for much of the comfort and safety of our everyday lives? Isn’t science the way we heat our homes, drive to work, fly around the world, have dependable food? Yes, there is the bomb—but there is also anesthesia.<br></p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>When it comes to viruses, the only tool we have to fight them is vaccination. The only tool. Antibiotics are for bacteria, a completely different sort of creature. Sanitation beyond personal hand-washing is ineffective. Vaccines trick the immune system into recognizing the virus earlier than it would otherwise and protect normal cells from invasion by the virus. Tricking the immune system is understandably problematic for people who believe that their body knows best if it’s just kept healthy. This virus, as we have seen from the array of infected people that includes apparently healthy folks, unfortunately does not subscribe to that belief.</p><p>By a similar sort of reasoning, some people make the plausible error of calculating that the vaccine is 95 percent effective but the survival rate is 99 percent, so why not just let my natural resistance take care of this? Indeed, that might not be unreasonable thinking if we were talking about the common cold, but this virus has shown itself to be a tricky character, and we are not yet able to predict who gets a serious case and who a mild one. With those sorts of stakes, you shouldn’t wager on either of those numbers because they have nothing to do with&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;as an individual. Like flipping a coin, there is only a 1 percent chance of it coming up heads 6 times in a row. But if it has come up heads 5 times in a row, the probability of it coming up heads on the next flip is…still 50/50.&nbsp;</p><p>An even larger unknown is whether there may be long-term effects associated with SARS-Cov-2, as is the case for many viruses. The 1918 influenza virus has been linked to a subsequent two-three fold increase in Parkinson’s disease by a mechanism we still don’t understand. The virus that gives children chicken pox will hide out in a person’s body for 40 years or more, and then emerge as a painful, sometimes debilitating, case of shingles. The 99 percent survivability rate of this virus is meaningless if, 20 years from now, it causes some devastating pulmonary or brain disease.</p><p>The main upside to vaccines is that because they use your already existing defense system, they are surprisingly safe. Safer than antibiotics, which have numerous side effects, because they are not part of our normal make up and are …</p></div></div>

    <p>Protobuf needs no introduction, but this post argues that you shouldn’t use it for telemetry.
The basic premise of this post is that a good telemetry library needs to be lightweight to avoid perturbing the application; inefficient diagnostic tools are self-defeating.
Unlike other formats, nested Protobuf messages cannot be written contiguously into a stream without significant buffering. 
The post doesn’t argue to never use Protobuf, but that the trade-off made by the <em>wire-format</em> itself, as opposed to any existing implementation, is unlikely to work for lightweight message senders.</p>

<h2 id="protobuf-java-is-a-little-heavy">Protobuf-java is a little heavy</h2>

<p>A few months ago I needed to become familiar with the Protobuf wire-format for a proof of concept.
The motivation for digging in to the wire-format, rather than just using <code>protobuf-java</code>, was the dimensions of the library, which I would need to bundle in an agent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>stat</span> <span>-c</span> %s protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar
1672950

<span>$ </span>jar <span>-tf</span> protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar | <span>grep</span> <span>'.class'</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
669
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just depending on the library adds 1.6MB and nearly 700 classes before you even generate your own message classes.
Since the deployment in question was an agent which can’t assume the presence of <code>protobuf-java</code> at runtime, there is no way to avoid bundling the extra 1.6MB.
Since the aforementioned agent implements <code>ClassLoader</code> isolation to avoid interfering with application class loading, even if <code>protobuf-java</code> <em>is</em> present at runtime, the classes would need to be loaded again by an isolated <code>ClassLoader</code>.</p>

<p>A tracer only needs to <em>produce</em> messages, so not all of those 669 classes (which doesn’t include your own generated classes) will get loaded, but a lot of them do.
Having since implemented library-neutral Protobuf serialisation in Datadog’s <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java">sketches-java</a>, I have a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java/blob/master/src/jmh/java/com/datadoghq/sketch/ddsketch/benchmarks/Serialize.java">point of comparison</a> to show how many classes get loaded in a write-only context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@OutputTimeUnit</span><span>(</span><span>TimeUnit</span><span>.</span><span>MICROSECONDS</span><span>)</span>
<span>@BenchmarkMode</span><span>(</span><span>Mode</span><span>.</span><span>AverageTime</span><span>)</span>

<p>Each method produces identical bytes, and the purpose of the benchmark above is to compare speeds.
One of the methods relies on a single class consisting of fewer than 150 lines of code, including white-space, whereas the other depends on a large library.
For the record, the hand-written method <code>serialize</code> above is roughly 10x faster than using <code>protobuf-java</code>, but it’s not the point of this post. 
By running the benchmark for a single warmup iteration each, with the argument <code>-jvmArgsPrepend "-verbose:class"</code>, the classes which are loaded are logged, which I captured in separate files.
276 more classes are loaded when using <code>protobuf-java</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> serialize.log 
1400 serialize.log
<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> to_proto.log 
1676 to_proto.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you work at a large organisation which has entirely embraced Protobuf, I would not suggest worrying about 1.6MB or a few hundred loaded classes; these costs quickly amortise as you use the library for more features.
However, your resource budget for a diagnostic agent which tells you what your application is doing and how it’s performing should be tiny, and I’m not sure <code>protobuf-java</code> can be made to fit in to it, given the isolation constraints for agents outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="length-delimiters-are-costly-to-produce">Length delimiters are costly to produce</h2>

<p>This meant that I needed to write my own (which is a lot easier than it sounds if you haven’t done this sort of thing before) so I had to read the only documentation there is on <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding</a>.
I couldn’t get the formatter I had written based on my first reading of this document to produce valid protobuf because I had skim-read the section on embedded messages, and because it includes a design decision that would never have occurred to me.
When I went back and read it again I was surprised to find that embedded messages are length-prefixed, but the length prefix is varint encoded, which means you don’t know how many bytes you need for the length until you’ve done the serialisation, and it’s recursive.</p>

<p>Length prefixes aren’t unusual in binary formats: BSON documents are prefixed by their sizes in bytes, meaning sub-documents need to be serialised recursively before their lengths can be written.
BSON makes this easy by not compressing the document length so you just leave 4 bytes for the length and come back and fill it in when popping document contexts (<a href="https://richardstartin.github.io/posts/shrinking-bson-documents">it can add up to a significant portion of your database though</a>).
Msgpack, for example, <em>does</em> apply prefix compression of embedded element lengths (e.g. maps and arrays) but the length is an element count, not a number of bytes, which makes streaming serialisation a lot easier to do.</p>

<p>Protobuf does both, and, consequently, there’s no way to produce nested Protobuf messages without doing something relatively expensive.
You must either maintain a stack and copy contents from frame to frame as they are popped, or pre-compute serialised lengths of nested elements recursively; it isn’t possible to simply write serialised output sequentially to a stream as it is with other formats. 
I abandoned the proof of concept when I found that a streaming zero-allocation msgpack codec I had written was around 6x faster than either <code>protobuf-java</code> or a handwritten Protobuf codec for messages with nesting.
Since I couldn’t remove the nesting in the messages I needed to produce, I blamed the wire-format and moved on.</p>

<p>People who actually know Protobuf already know this (it’s literally written in the encoding manual), and understand the benefits which arise from this cost elsewhere (e.g. implementing partial deserialisation is easy, easy to skip over sections of the message), but lots of people don’t seem to understand the cost model the wire-format imposes.
If they did, there would probably be a lot less nesting in Protobuf as used in the wild.</p>

<p>This more or less concludes my argument against using Protobuf for telemetry: if you find for yourself that producing Protobuf messages is costly, it’s not even a case of a third party library making the wrong trade-offs for your application; it’s the wire-format itself at fault.
If you want to ship telemetry data out of an application and aim to minimise the impact on the application, even if you implement your own zero-allocation, micro-optimised codec, you shouldn’t choose Protobuf.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to segue into describing the wire-format for Protobuf 3, filling in a couple of the gaps in <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">Google’s encoding document</a>, but read the official document if you want to write your own.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-the-wire-format">Notes on the wire format</h2>

<p>Protobuf’s wire format is really simple: it’s just a list of tagged key-value pairs. 
Since readers have a schema to refer to, ambiguity is permissible and advantageous.
The logical structure of a Protobuf message is as below, with each tag followed by some bytes associated with the tag.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>tag1:value1, tag3:value2, tag2:value3, ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is a pseudo-Backus-Naur form of the wire format.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>body 	         ::= 	tagged_value*
tagged_value     ::=    tag value
tag              ::=    varint((field_number &lt;&lt; 3) | wire_type)
wire_type        ::=    VARINT | FIXED_64 | LENGTH_DELIMITED | GROUP_BEGIN | GROUP_END | FIXED_32
VARINT           ::=    0
FIXED_64         ::=    1
LENGTH_DELIMITED ::=    2
GROUP_BEGIN      ::=    3 (deprecated)
GROUP_END        ::=    4 (deprecated)
FIXED_32         ::=    5
value            ::=    varint | fixed_64 | length_delimited | fixed_32
fixed_64         ::=    double | long
length_delimited ::=    varint(N) byte{N}
fixed_32         ::=    float | int
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each data item has a tag, which contains the field number (as defined in the .proto file) and one of the four wire types still in use in Protobuf 3.
The tag is constructed by shifting the field number left by three bits and combining with the wire type, and then <em>varint-encoded</em> so it takes up less space.
Since there are only three bits for the wire type, there can only ever be eight wire types, and two have already been wasted on group begin and end markers (I don’t know the story behind these).
Given that <code>FIXED_32=5</code> with only two possible wire types left, I imagine that there were some tense meetings before deciding to add it.</p>

<p>The terminology above is my own, but notice that there are no terms like <code>repeated</code>, <code>oneof</code>, or <code>message</code>.
This is because they don’t exist at this level. 
<code>message</code> is just a length delimiter followed by some more protobuf, preceded by a <code>LENGTH_DELIMITED</code> tag; the schema has the necessary information to read the raw bytes.
<code>repeated</code> fields come in two kinds: packed and not packed. 
Packed <code>repeated</code> fields are indistinguishable from a <code>message</code> or a <code>string</code> on the wire.
<code>repeated</code> fields which aren’t packed are a list of tag-values with the same field number and the element type in each tag, and they don’t need to be contiguous within the message.
Incidentally, writers aren’t obliged not to repeat non-<code>repeated</code> fields, and as there is nothing to distinguish these fields over the wire, readers are obliged to take the <em>last value</em> for a non-<code>repeated</code> field (which makes some of the partial deserialisers I’ve seen illegal).</p>

<p><code>FIXED_32</code> corresponds to proto types <code>float</code>, <code>fixed32</code>, and <code>sfixed32</code>, whereas <code>FIXED_64</code> corresponds to <code>double</code>, <code>fixed64</code>, and <code>sfixed64</code>.
All other integers, which includes booleans, are <em>varint</em> encoded, which has the basic effect of removing leading zeros in order to save space.
Starting with the least significant bits, seven bits are taken at a time from the integer until no bits remain, and all but the last byte have their most significant bit set.
This allows the parser to detect the end of an integer by looking for a byte with the MSB unset. 
Whilst this saves space, it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the beginning of the corona pandemic, I work from home. This means my MacBook is constantly connected to the charger. For Lithium-Ion batteries, it's not healthy to remain charged at 100% all the time. I first noticed that there's a problem when my trackpad wasn't clicking properly anymore. Upon inspection with a ruler, I noticed that the keyboard was curved because the battery had swollen. To replace the swollen battery, the entire Topcase had to be replaced.</p>
<p>To avoid this from happening again, I started looking for a way to control the charging behavior of my MacBook.</p>
<p>In Mac OS Catalina 10.15.5, Apple has introduced a new feature called <code>Battery Health</code>. It is found under <code>System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver</code>. Apple describes the feature as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The battery health management feature in macOS 10.15.5 is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and its charging patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the measurements that it collects, battery health management may reduce your battery's maximum charge when in this mode. This happens as needed to ensure that your battery charges to a level that's optimized for your usage-reducing wear on the battery, and slowing its chemical aging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what does that mean exactly? The description in the System Preferences is a bit clearer:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>According to this message, OS X will start reducing the maximum charge of the battery when it ages, to extend its lifespan. In my tests, it drained the battery a bit after being plugged in for a while and then recharged it back to 100%. Since my battery health is still high, it didn't reduce the maximum charge even after being plugged in for multiple days.</p>
<p>This wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted to control the maximum charge level myself before the battery was degraded. Lenovo and Tesla are both offering such a feature out of the box, Apple doesn't. Luckily there's a free tool that allows you to take control over the maximum charge level.</p>
<p> <strong>AlDente</strong> gives you the possibility to set a maximum charge level for your MacBook. The tool itself writes this value to the SMC of your MacBook. Most likely it's just using the same feature OS X is using, just more explicitly.</p>

<h2>How to install AlDente</h2>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlDente's Github Page</a> and download the latest release. Then unzip the archive and move <code>AlDente.app</code> to your Applications folder.</p>
<p>Upon opening, you'll probably get a message like <code>AlDente cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified</code>. To work around this, right-click on the application and click <code>Open</code>:</p>

<p>When you start AlDente for the first time, it will ask you to install its helper tool. This is required for AlDente to be able to write the SMC value as root.</p>
<p>Once the app is running, set the value to the maximum you desire. I would recommend a value between <strong>60 and 80 percent</strong> - I chose 70 percent as my sweet spot.</p>
<p>After that, you need to reboot to ensure the value is taken into account. If your battery is currently above your threshold, you'll have to unplug your MacBook, drain it below the threshold and then plug it back in. Once your defined maximum is reached, it will stop charging and display <code>Not Charging</code>.</p>

<h2>Compatible MacBooks</h2>
<p>This should work on every Intel MacBook running Catalina or higher. It is currently <strong>NOT</strong> supported on ARM-based MacBooks. I have successfully tested it on a <strong>2018 MacBook Pro 15"</strong> and a <strong>2019 MacBook Pro 16"</strong>. Based on information from the Github page, the following hardware is also confirmed working:</p>
<ul>
<li>2020 MacBook Pro 13" with 4 TB3 ports</li>
<li>2019 MacBook Pro 16"</li>
<li>2017 MacBook Pro 13" without TouchBar</li>
<li>2017 MacBook Air 13"</li>
<li>2013 MacBook Pro 13"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uninstalling AlDente</h2>
<p>To uninstall <code>AlDente</code>, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the maximum battery charge to 100%</li>
<li>Exit the application</li>
<li>Move the app to the trash</li>
<li>Remove the helper tool with the commands below</li>
<li>Reboot your MacBook</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove the helper tool, run the following commands in the Terminal:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>sudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.davidwernhart.Helper
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.davidwernhart.Helper.plist</code></pre></div>
<p><br>This should do the trick. If you want to be thorough, you can also <a href="https://nicam.dev/support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reset the SMC</a> after uninstalling it.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

    <p>The idea of this post is to introduce and discuss several interesting research programs from the past decade. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program">research program</a> (or programme) refers to a common thread of research that shares similar assumptions, methodology, etc. The list below contains a variety of research programs: some on topics that have broad appeal e.g. <a href="#machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">explainable machine learning</a> and <a href="#the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">mental disorder</a>; others moved the direction of entire industries e.g. advances in <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">computer vision</a> and <a href="#blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>; and others still are more niche areas that I happen to be deeply interested in e.g. <a href="#topological-learning-theory">topological learning theory</a>, <a href="#privacy-attacks-on-machine-learning-models">privacy attacks on ML models</a>, and <a href="#the-graph-theoretic-approach-to-epistemic-justification">graph-theoretic approaches to epistemology</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, a list of this variety can never be complete and is surely biased by what I happen to be reading. If I’ve missed something interesting that you enjoy, let me know at <a href="mailto:brettcmullins@gmail.com">brettcmullins@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="image-recognition-and-object-detection">Image Recognition and Object Detection</h2>
<hr>

<p>It is difficult for me to begin this list without first talking about the area that most affected my professional career, led to (or at least accelerated) a boom in data science, and <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/overviews/neural-net-history">potentially thawed an AI winter</a>. During the 2010s, <a href="https://bmk.sh/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/">deep learning made enormous progress</a> in heuristics and applications. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a> in particular, a good starting point is <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a> in 2012 which used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> architecture to substantially surpass existing benchmarks for image recognition - the task of assigning a label such as <em>cat</em>, <em>dog</em>, or <em>tree</em> to an image - on the <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet dataset</a>. Over the next few years, improvements would continue with architectures such as <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/vgg-neural-networks-the-next-step-after-alexnet-3f91fa9ffe2c">VGG</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">ResNet</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf">Inception</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>With progress being made with recognition, other tasks such as object detection - finding and labeling objects (sometimes multiple objects) within images - became more feasible. One approach to object detection introduced in 2013 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524">Regional CNNs (or R-CNNs)</a> combined a model that first produced promising bounding boxes then utilized the newly developed recognition models (starting with AlexNet) to classify or label the regions in the bounding boxes. Over the next few years, progress in this direction was realized with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Fast R-CNN</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Faster R-CNN</a>. These frameworks not only employed better recognition models and found better bounding boxes, but they integrated the model components together so that they could be more efficiently trained or tailored to one’s application. <a href="https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4">Here is an excellent overview</a> of these models with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>Accompanying these new techniques and improvements was a large amount of software - with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffe_(software)">Caffe</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)">Torch</a> at first then the more user friendly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras">Keras</a> - allowing anyone to implement these models for their use cases. It’s also worth mentioning the proliferation of online courses such as <a href="https://fast.ai/">fast.ai’s</a> <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> that facilitated getting potential users up to speed to test out and deploy these tools.</p>

<h2 id="topological-learning-theory">Topological Learning Theory</h2>
<hr>

<p>Topological Learning Theory is the mathematical study of the learnability/solvability of hypotheses/problems that is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">theory of computation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory">descriptive set theory</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference">classical statistics</a> (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory">statistical learning theory</a>). The idea of learning theory is to analyze the learnability of hypotheses as one incrementally receives information about the true state of the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3858127/pexels-photo-3858127.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" width="200" height="350"></p>

<p>A <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/learning-formal/#1.1">classic example</a> is to consider an ornithologist observing the color of ravens as, say, black or not. With each raven observed, the ornithologist gains information which rules out some hypotheses but is consistent with others. By coding a black raven as 1 and other ravens as 0, we can mathematically represent possible observation histories as infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, i.e. points in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space">Cantor space</a>. The crux of this approach is that the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jsr25/Spring_11/Lecture_Notes/dst_lecture_notes_2011_lec_2.pdf">topology on the Cantor space and other such spaces</a> naturally <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/kelly/learnreview.pdf">encodes the idea of information accumulation</a>. By considering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_hierarchy">descriptive complexity of hypotheses</a>, identifying a hypothesis with the set of sequences that make it true, we can say things about the learnability of the hypothesis. For instance, the hypothesis “all ravens are black” is the set containing the single sequence of all 1s. We say that this hypothesis is falsifiable since if there is a non-black raven our ornithologist will eventually observe it; however, it is verifiable not in finite time but in the limit since the hypothesis is never conclusively true after any finite number of observations. This corresponds to the topological notion of properly being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%CF%83_set">$F_{\sigma}$ or $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ set</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/kevin-kelly.html">Kevin Kelly’s</a> 1996 <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-logic-of-reliable-inquiry-9780195091953?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Logic of Reliable Inquiry</em></a> has been an authoritative text on formal learning theory in the Cantor space and other <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Polish+space">Polish spaces</a>. Advances in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computable+analysis">computable analysis</a> beginning in the early 2000s have enabled the extension of these classical formal learning theory results to a more general topological setting throughout the 2010s. The paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540109001631?via%3Dihub"><em>Topological Properties of Concept Spaces</em></a> from 2010 is the first to connect these computable analysis results to learning theory. By 2015, a pair of papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07518"><em>On the Solvability of Inductive Problems</em></a> and <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/TARK2015-proceedings.pdf#page=119"><em>Theory Choice, Theory Change, and Inductive Truth-Conduciveness</em></a> - both presented at the <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/tark15.html">TARK 2015 conference</a> - provide complete topological characterizations of learnability/solvability in the limit as well as connections to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-belief-revision/">belief revision theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Ockham’s Razor</a> in this more general topological setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">The Disordered Mind Theory of Mental Illness</h2>
<hr>

<p>In a series of articles and books over the past decade, the philosopher <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/george-graham">George Graham</a> develops a theory of mental disorder with the following qualities: 1. is non-reductionist with respect to the mind and the brain; 2. is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind">philosophy of mind</a>; and 3. coheres with the experiences of patients and clinicians. Graham’s theory holds that mental illness is distinct from somatic/bodily illness though may co-occur or otherwise be bound up with so-called <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07609-001">broken brains</a>. A helpful analogy for what is meant here by “the mental” or “the mind” is to view the brain as computer hardware, whereas the mind is software. On this picture, the mind and the brain are surely not independent; a hardware issue may impede the computation of some software. However, one may have bugs in one’s software - “gumming up the works” to use a common phrase of Graham - on perfectly functioning hardware.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.routledge.com/common/jackets/amazon/978036732/9780367322328.jpg" width="200" height="280"></p>

<p>This theory of mental disorder is developed in Graham’s text on mental illness in the context of the philosophy of mind: <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Disordered-Mind/Graham/p/book/9780367322328"><em>The Disordered Mind</em></a>. A follow-up book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-abraham-dilemma-9780198728658?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Abraham Dilemma</em></a>, refines this theory for the case of delusion, religious delusion in particular (I discuss <em>The Abraham Dilemma</em> in greater detail in my <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/top-books-2020/#the-abraham-dilemma-a-divine-delusion">Top Books in 2020</a>). Graham’s latest book <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/hearing-voices-and-other-matters-of-the-mind-9780190091149?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind</em></a> explores the unique properties and challenges of mental disorders in the presence of religious content. The disordered mind theory <a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-disordered-mind-an-introduction-to-philosophy-of-mind-and-mental-illness/">is not without its detractors</a> who hold that Graham goes too far in arguing that one need not situate and commit to positions in the philosophy of mind to reject the complete reduction of mental illness to neuroscience.</p>

<p>I took George Graham’s seminar on Philosophy and Mental Illness in 2014 at <a href="https://philosophy.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</a> and had several interesting chats with him about the metaphysics and definability of mental disorders.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">Machine Learning Interpretability and Explainability</h2>

<p>The boom in data science and widespread use of machine learning models during the past decade was accelerated by innovations in model architectures as well as tools and software to train and deploy these models. In addition to the <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">progress with neural networks and deep learning</a>, algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost">XGBoost</a> allowed users to achieve state-of-the-art classification and regression performance without much effort. XGBoost in particular became so prevalent in both industry and ML competitions - as had logistic regression and other GLMs in the past - that it was not unreasonable for some to wonder whether or not <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d">we should just use XGBoost all the time</a>.</p>

<p>For all that these models gained in performance, they lost ground in being able to provide answers to questions from stakeholders, developers, and so forth when things went wrong as to why a model’s prediction was so far off or why does the computer vision model <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf">think a banana is a toaster</a>. Two approaches were offered as a solution (three if you count “Who cares?! Let’s do nothing!”): interpretability and explanations. The former offers constraints on model building such as limiting the number of features used and restricting to linear models so that the model is sufficiently simple to allow the developer/user to reliably predict the model’s behavior with a reasonable amount of effort. The latter is a set of methods for generating reasons for a model’s behavior for arbitrarily complex models. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490"><em>The Mythos of Model Interpretability</em></a> is an early effort to disentangle these terms and map the landscape for understanding models. Also see <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/economic_methodology_interpretable_ml_blackboxes/">my attempt here</a> as well as Christoph Molnar’s ever-evolving text <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><em>Interpretable Machine Learning</em></a>.</p>

<p><img width="40%" height="40%" src="https://bcmullins.github.io/images/blog/best_articles_2018/anchor.png"></p>

<p>The approach that I find the most compelling stems from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME paper</a>. LIME (or local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) is a method of generating an interpretable, i.e. linear, approximation of a model in the neighborhood of a given point in the feature space. This new model is then used to generate explanations by virtue of its interpretability. A second approach for classifiers called <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a> - both are developed by the <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/group.html">same research group at UW</a> that also developed XGBoost - produces a simple region of the feature space (a rectangle) where the model’s prediction holds with high probability for a given point. This region or anchor acts as a sort of sufficiency condition for classification. The image to the right illustrates these ideas with the dotted line being a local linear approximation and the …</p></div></div>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies that law enforcement may use at protests and other public gathering to spying on people exercising their fundamental rights. Learn how to spot the surveillance so you can advocate effectively for the policies necessary to protect your rights and bring transparency to the police surveillance.</p>

<p>If you attend a protest, demonstration or any mass gathering in a public space, the police are probably surveilling you. Whether it’s sophisticated facial recognition, ubiquitous video recording, or the instant analysis of our biometric data, law enforcement agencies are following closely behind their counterparts in the military and intelligence services in acquiring privacy-invasive technologies, from automated license plate readers to body-worn cameras to drones and more.  In this talk, Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies in use:
<br>	• Where to look for these devices
<br>	• How these technologies look
<br>	• How these technologies function
<br>	• How they are used by police
<br>	• What kind of data they collect
<br>	• Where to learn more about them
<br>Knowledge is power. Knowing what technologies are in use can help you understand the threats to your privacy and security, as well as tools to advocate for limits on police use of surveillance that may chill people’s rights to express themselves on public issues.  Just as analog surveillance historically has been used as a tool for oppression, policymakers and the public must understand the threat posed by emerging technologies to successfully defend human rights in the digital age. </p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>After the first unsuccessful deployment of voting machines in Germany about ten years ago, elements of electronic voting have reached elections again. Although there is now still a paper-trail, more and more essential steps, such as counting the votes, are moved into electronic systems. This change in the ballot-counting procedure took place mostly unnoticed by the public. We are two very concerned election workers who present our first-hand experience in this talk. We show that the current digital procedure is conceptually and practically flawed in terms of security. First, we give an insight into the role of computers and their interaction with humans during ballot-counting. We show that the underlying system concepts contradict IT-security best-practices. Next, we present an in-depth analysis of one ballot-counting software, deployed for the Bavarian municipal elections ("Kommunalwahlen"). We discovered several severe security vulnerabilities that allow an almost unnoticeable manipulation of local voting results. Finally, we conclude that there is an immediate need for action to re-establish election security and transparency - not only for the government but for everyone of us.</p>

<p>Elections are a key element of every democracy. However, many democratic countries in the world have to face attacks on them, be it by the government or by foreign countries. Even if ballot counting has been finished, election results are often not accepted but questioned due to alleged manipulations. All these aspects pose major threats to democracy as they try to undermine the actual and publicly perceived integrity of elections.</p>

<p>In Germany, elections are usually considered quite secure. Elections are paper-based and the subsequent ballot-counting is open to the public. The infamous introduction of electronic voting machines about ten years ago was finally stopped by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, everything is human-controlled, transparent, and secure – isn’t it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these claims are questionable since the silent introduction of electronic vote counting. The election system in Germany is quite complex, for example in the "Kreistagswahlen" (~district elections) workers have to count up to 70 individual votes per ballot, while respecting a special rule set. This process is very labor-intensive and sufficient election workers are often hard to come by. Due to this, electronic systems were introduced that provide support during vote counting. Election workers are no longer required to fill tally sheets, count votes, and sum them up on their own. Each ballot is simply entered into a software that performs all the magic and finally emits a result.</p>

<p>This year, we volunteered again as election workers, but our trust in electronically-assisted elections has been vastly impacted. As IT-security researchers, we consider it our responsibility to share and discuss our concerns. We performed a thorough analysis of the concept and the hard- and software of the electronic vote counting system. We discovered several flaws on a conceptual and practical level, that can severely diminish the integrity of the election and makes it prone to manipulations. To underline the impact of the system’s vulnerabilities, we demonstrate an exemplary attack on an election.</p>

<p>Finally, we propose different options on how to make elections secure again. We do not consider this an entirely technical case, as there are significant legal and societal circumstances that led to the deployment of this insecure system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=473">‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’</a> by Donald Knuth from 2001. Recommended reading if you like reading about how a world-renowned computer scientist wrote a book about how he wrote a book that deals with another book! Sounds recursive 😏</p>



<p>That last book is of course the bible and the book Knuth wrote about it is <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=1">‘3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated ‘</a> — published in 1991. And in 1999 Knuth gave <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">a series of lectures at MIT</a> <em>‘on the general subject of relations between faith and science’.</em> In these lectures he explains how he went about writing this book and the thought process involved. So the lectures make for an enjoyable deep dive on creating such a book and how Knuth’s brain works, paired with discussions and insights on religion and things like eternity and finiteness.</p>



<p>And it is this series of lectures that are bundled together in ‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’ — almost verbatim. But, the lectures have also always been available as audio files (sadly no visuals) on <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">Knuth’s homepage</a>. And I listened to those a few years back, and as I read this book I was reminded that I had created a RSS feed for these files, <strong>effectively creating a Knuth podcast!</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml"><img loading="lazy" src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.jpeg 1550w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a><figcaption>This is a later picture of Donald Knuth and not from the 1999 lectures. I added the text, of course in the <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern">only possible font</a>.<br>(I have no copyright on this picture and couldn’t find out who did actually. Feel free to drop me a line if I can accredit you, or if you want it changed.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I mostly created the file for myself to have the convenience of listening to the lectures in a podcast player. But I have also dropped the link to the XML file <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21967785">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19688748">there</a> over the years, and I noticed 607 <strong>unique</strong> IP addresses hit this link this month alone! There are only six lectures and one panel discussion and never any new content, so I am not sure what these numbers mean, if they mean anything at all. </p>



<p>But I also remembered I had never blogged about this, until now. So without further ado here is the link: </p>



<p><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml">https://j11g.com/knuth.xml</a></p>



<p>You can add this to your favorite podcast player. I have added the feed to Overcast myself so <a href="https://piks.nl/upload/upload/_pn_2020-12-29_11-02-22.png">it looks like this</a> which is nice.</p>



<p>Having the audiofiles available in a podcast player enables you to track progress, speed up/down parts and have an <a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM/status/1223317202478211076">enhanced</a> audio experience.</p>



<p>I do remember writing an email (<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">no hyphen</a>) to Knuth’s office and I received a nice reply that they thought it was <em>‘a great idea’</em>, and they were actually also thinking of starting their own podcast ‘<em>based on these materials’</em>. However I haven’t found any link to this yet, so for now it is just this.</p>



<p>If you are more into video, here is a great conversation Donald Knuth had with Lex Fridman last year. Published exactly a year ago to this day. The video is not embeddable but  you can click the image to go there. Recommended.</p>

<br/>
December 30, 2020 | https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The triggers discussed in this post are powerful levers to influence peoples decision making processes. Never ever abuse this knowledge. Apply it in ethical ways and call out unethical usage when you spot it in the wild.</p>
<p>Your Landing Page is finally live and the metrics are promising but your conversion rates are still a little bit behind? It seems like there's some interest in your product but for some reason people aren't convinced enough to click that call-to-action.</p>
<p>Maybe you're running an ecommerce store and sales are great. But aren't there any tweaks you can apply to increase your sales even further?</p>
<p>Sometimes all that's necessary is a little nudge. In this blog post we'll examine what that nudge might be. How you can drive more attention towards action-taking rather than closing the browser tab and moving on. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2>Human needs</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is by no means a scientific write-up. If you're interested in the fascinating topic of Psychology I'd encourage you to pick up some legit literature such as "Thinking Fast and Slow" or to connect with an expert who majored in Psychology.</p>
<p>Before jumping right into the triggers, let's take a step back and understand why knowing the basics of human psychology is such an important and fascinating skill to possess.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything we do on a day-to-day is somehow influenced by our unconscious, the part of our being we cannot directly control. One of the many sources of information that has formed and still informs our unconscious is the basics of human behavior and desires. At the core, humans are very social beings. Forming tribes helped us survive and thrive in uncertain times. It's important for us to show that we're worthy being part of the tribe. Being an outsider by taking unapproved actions put oneself at huge risks and disadvantages. Risks that usually translated into pain and death. As it turned out, it made a whole lot of sense to play by the rules and adhere to the consensus.</p>
<p>Times have changed and nowadays there's a lot less risk involved when making decisions. However the tribal thinking is still deeply rooted in ourselves and therefore influences the actions we take.</p>
<p>Do you study reviews before buying products online? Do you browse through the comments on a YouTube video? Both of those actions are driven by the fact that we want to see what our peers are thinking and how they might think about us when we buy the item in question or like the videos content.</p>
<h2>The Triggers</h2>
<p>Now that we learned more about basic human needs and what drives us, it's time to take a deep dive into the different Psychological Triggers you can use to tap into those needs and nudge your visitors to take certain actions.</p>
<h3>1. Me vs. You</h3>
<p>To some extent, everyone is an egoist. While that might sound harsh it's a reality that people are obsessed with themselves. Knowing this puts you at a huge advantage because you can articulate your copywriting in a way that speaks directly to your users "self".</p>
<p>Don't talk about your company, the achievements and prizes you won. Don't write a wall of text outlining every single feature your product offers. Your company is in the business since the late 90s? Your app has a "dark mode"? That's all great but <strong>nobody really cares</strong>!</p>
<p>What matters are the benefits your users will experience when using your product. What are they dreaming about? What pain does your product address? How does your product help them live a better life? That's all that matters.</p>
<p>Update your copywriting to talk directly to your users rather than about you. Paint a picture of their dream and how your product helps them turn that dream into a reality.</p>
<h3>2. Making Progress</h3>
<p>There are only 9 pages left to complete the chapter in your favorite book? You only have to collect one more item to reach the next level in your favorite video game?</p>
<p>People love to make progress. It just feels good to take a project all the way from 0% to 100%. Even better if the progress is visualized and you can see the progress bar increasing with every little step of the way.</p>
<p>Use this love for progress in your products and services. Do you have a time-consuming onboarding process? Break it up into individual pieces and show a progress bar at the top of the page which updates as your users fill out the forms. Are you looking for more Newsletter sign ups? Display a "50% done" progress bar at the top of your Newsletter Form and call out that your visitor is "almost there".</p>
<p>Whenever you're looking for more commitment from your users, break the task down into individual pieces and add some information which makes it clear as to what the current status is and what is necessary to make progress.</p>
<h3>3. Time</h3>
<p>Time is one of the resources which cannot be created. Time will move on, no matter what you do. Given this, everyone values their time more than anything else.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways you can work with the "Time trigger".</p>
<p>The first one being to call out how much your product will help your users save time. Do you automate a time-consuming process? Do the math and clearly show your users how much time they'll save when they use your app. Time they can spend with their significant other or kids (you want to call that out as well).</p>
<p>Another usage of the "Time trigger" can often be found in conjunction with scarcity. "25% for the next 24 hours", "Registrations only open today". Those are the phrases you'll usually find on ecommerce stores or online course websites. You can do the same and offer time-bound discounts. If you do so, please make sure that your offer is legit. Use time and scarcity in a dishonest way and you'll immediately lose trust.</p>
<h3>4. Comparing and Contrasting</h3>
<p>The "Basic Plan" is 99 USD while the "Pro Plan" which has significantly more features is only 129 USD? Most people would pick the "Pro Plan" given that it has more features to offer. Even if those features will never be used. Looking at it through the lens of logic it doesn't really make sense to go with the "Pro Plan" if the "Basic Plan" would be more than enough in terms of value delivered.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it's not about what the product is, it's about what it stands next to. You can use this fact to steer the decision making process in the direction of your liking. Make it easy for your users to compare and contrast different offerings. Even if you don't plan to sell a cheaper option, offer it anyway and put it next to the one which is slightly more expensive but more feature rich. You'd be amazed to see that most of your users will go with the more expensive option even if they'll never user all the features it offers.</p>
<h3>5. Fear</h3>
<p>A huge major driving force which is ingrained in everyone of us is fear. Fear comes in many different forms. We're fearful of failure, bad things happening to our loved ones and the inevitable death.</p>
<p>Another form of fear is the "fear of missing out" a.k.a FOMO. Always being in the known gives us huge advantages and an edge over our competition. Missing out on a major new trend or business opportunity could have detrimental consequences.</p>
<p>You can trigger the "fear of missing out" by subtly talking about the possibility of missing out on a huge opportunity when passing on your offering.</p>
<p>A prime example which shows this in action are travel booking websites. Remember that "12 people have visited this listing in the last 6 hours" notification on the hotel website. You don't want to be the person who misses out on this great deal!</p>
<h3>6. Social Proof</h3>
<p>As we already learned, us humans are social animals. Being social doesn't only mean that we like to socialize with each other, it also means that we tend to mimic and "copy" one another to be more likeable and therefore accepted in our peer group.</p>
<p>Do you want to buy something but you're not sure which option to go with? It might be a good idea to study the testimonials, reviews and ratings to make a more informed decision. The new Todo-app you just discovered looks quite compelling but why bother given that you're already using the stock Todo-app on your phone? As it turns out, at least a handful of Fortune 500 companies and Silicon Valley juggernauts are using it in their day-to-day so it can't be that bad.</p>
<p>You want to be a part of your tribe so naturally you're looking at what your peers are doing. This is what "Social Proof" is all about. Showing that you're about to make the right decision because peers in your tribe did the same.</p>
<p>Do you already have happy customers using your app? Take some time to conduct some interviews and translate those into testimonials you can put on your Landing Page. Maybe you have some large enterprises using your product. Write some Case Studies to show what value your product offers. There are entire software applications you can use to display social proof widgets on your homepage or ecommerce store ("Someone in New York bought this item 2 hours ago").</p>
<h3>7. Acting logical</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to believe that all the decisions she makes are entirely driven by logic. As it turns out this is not true most of the time. You and I buy products based on emotion rather than logic. Just pay close attention to the advertisements you see every day. Almost every single one speaks in the language of emotions rather than logic.</p>
<p>But once the decision has been made and the purchase is done we tend to justify our actions based on logic. "I bought the car because there was a discount and a friend of mine knows the car dealership owner. Furthermore I get the first service for free and it's also an older model so it's cheaper than buying a brand new one. ...". Observe yourself and others and you'll notice that all of us try to retroactively fit our decision making into logical bits and pieces. Even if it sometime results in contradictions and lies.</p>
<p>What you want to do is to supply additional information about your product which helps your users justify the purchase in a logical manner. Have a dedicated "Features" page which lists out all the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am pretty much a knowledge addict.</p>
<p>I use Twitter, RSS, and numerous other mediums of information — from Telegram channels to standalone blogs.</p>
<p>Out of a thousand articles a hundred gets skimmed through. A few dozens make it to my "Read Later" list, and only a fraction I find worthy of sharing.</p>
<p>These worthy ones end up in <a href="https://drobinin.com/newsletter/">my weekly newsletter, the Tuesday Triage</a>, where I comment on the most intriguing articles I've read and share facts I learnt over the week.</p>
<p>Some of those trivia are not trivial at all, so I decided to condense this <em>crème de la crème of the Internet</em> in a subjective list of the best ones in no particular order.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="solresol"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol">Solresol</a> <a href="#solresol">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most people know about the esperanto, an artificially created language. Way less people are aware of Solresol, another artificial language, built upon the musical grammar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your health good? - Redofafa?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the countryside this year? - Fadoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the theatre tonight? - Soldoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Sol-resol.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="logbook"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Logbook</a> <a href="#logbook">¶</a></h4>
<p>As developers we work with logs a lot. And the logs are stored in logbooks (or at least they were). What's the ethymology?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term originally referred to a book for recording readings from the chip log that was used to estimate a ship's speed through the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how come a chip log was used to estimate a ship's speed? In the absence of GPS and without any visible clues about the speed of a ship in the open water, sailors started to throw wooden pieces with a tied strope (hence the definition of knots as nautical miles per hour!) into water and then measure the relative speed against such logs, hence the name.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="popcorn-in-the-1800s"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn#Consumption">Popcorn in the 1800s</a> <a href="#popcorn-in-the-1800s">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Popcorn as a breakfast cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't surprise me when I think about this as a dish, and yet I'd probably never come up with that on my own.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="danakil-depression"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danakil_Depression">Danakil Depression</a> <a href="#danakil-depression">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Danakil Depression is the northern part of the Afar Triangle or Afar Depression in Ethiopia, a geological depression that has resulted from the divergence of three tectonic plates in the Horn of Africa.</p>

<h4 id="ansi-k-100.1-1974"><a href="https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6140/K100.1-1974%20-%20American%20National%20Standard%20Safety%20Code%20%26%20Requirements%20for%20Dry%20Martinis%20.pdf">ANSI K 100.1-1974</a> <a href="#ansi-k-100.1-1974">¶</a></h4>
<p>The year is 1974. The American National Standards Institute introduces safety code and requirements for dry martinis, and boy-oh-boy are they good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p><em>Gibson.</em><br>
An unpardonable form of perversion. See onion soup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test Methods</p>
<p>[...] In testing, the taster shall watch for lightness of color, absence of sediment, a delicate aroma that effectively combines the scent of the juniper with the herbal infusion in the vermouth, a taste that is both sharp and clean with a faint body, and a light delicate aftertaste.</p>

<h4 id="by-the-bye"><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/57078/by-the-bye-etymology-and-usage">By the bye</a> <a href="#by-the-bye">¶</a></h4>
<p>This example left me, to put it succinctly, flabbergasted for a brief moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>by the by or by the bye : INCIDENTALLY [defined as "by way of interjection or digression : by the way"]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if it will help me to up the game of interrupting folks in conversations.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="pie-barm"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barm_cake">Pie Barm</a> <a href="#pie-barm">¶</a></h4>
<p>Watch after my hands:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We ferment a liquid (beer, wine, or stock)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We take the foam from the top of the liquid (this is called <strong>barm</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use this foam to leaven a bread roll, and then put something inside it (now this is called a <strong>barm cake</strong>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And if we do all of that in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, we most likely would put a pie as a filling (they also host the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-manchester-46620294/world-pie-eating-champion-crowned-in-wigan">World Pie Eating Championship</a>, so no surprise). And here it is, the pie barm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Wigan, a whole savoury pie is served in a barm cake, known locally as a "Wigan Kebab".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/random-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5813a857-4338-41ec-a2db-d751d986268c.jpeg?resize=878%2C659&amp;ssl=1" alt="The image by https://random-times.com/2020/04/24/pie-barm-an-unconventional-traditional-sandwich-from-wigan-england/"></p><hr>
<h4 id="two-spaces-after-period"><a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/two-spaces-after-period/">Two spaces after period</a> <a href="#two-spaces-after-period">¶</a></h4>
<p>Back then people had to put two spaces after punctuation marks as typewriters had monospaced typesetting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s why: Back when we used typewriters, every character was given the exact same amount of space on the page. That meant the letter i was given the same amount of space as the letter m, even though it clearly didn’t need it. This is called monospaced typesetting and it’s, well, spacey. We needed that extra space between sentences to make it easier to see the beginning of new sentences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days quite a few still do that; usually one can easily assume they've learnt to type not on a computer.</p>
<p>Rarely, one encounters someone like me, with a typewriter next to the keyboard, and just thinks I am stupid and don't know thine grammar.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="erstwhile"><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile">erstwhile</a> <a href="#erstwhile">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here is a beautiful word I unearthed recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The adverb erstwhile has been part of English since the 16th century, but it is formed from two words that are much older. It comes from the Old English words ær, meaning "early", and hwīl, which has much the same meaning as the modern word while. (The English word ere, meaning "before," is also descendant of ær.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used as a synonim to "former", e.g "erstwhile enemies".</p>

<h4 id="children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail"><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brief-history-children-sent-through-mail-180959372/">Children used to be sent through the Mail</a> <a href="#children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail">¶</a></h4>
<p>I am just surprised that this practice was eventually banned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a few weeks after Parcel Post began, an Ohio couple named Jesse and Mathilda Beagle “mailed” their 8-month-old son James to his grandmother, who lived just a few miles away in Batavia. According to Lynch, Baby James was just shy of the 11-pound weight limit for packages sent via Parcel Post, and his “delivery” cost his parents only 15 cents in postage (although they did insure him for $50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postage was cheaper than train tickets back then (and still is, actually), so I can't really blame the parents.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ek-number"><a href="https://digg.com/2018/how-different-countries-laugh-online">ek number</a> <a href="#ek-number">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes I realize that speaking in one (two, three, ...) languages means there are corners of the Internet and/or world you can't appreciate, in the first place because you can't understand them.</p>
<p>So while knowing both English and Russian is usually more than enough to find an answer to almost any question, I still miss the jewels like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ek number," which loosely translates to "I rate this number one" — the "ek" itself means "one" in Hindi — is commonly used as an affirmative response to a joke. If you find something to be funny, you could always type "haha" or "hehe" in India, but you can also signal your enjoyment by responding "ek number."</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips"><a href="http://www.dandelionchocolate.com/2020/06/18/remy-chocolate-chip/">Remy Labesque and chocolate chips</a> <a href="#remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips">¶</a></h4>
<p>Chocolate chips have a water drop's shape because it's easier to make that way. It's harder to use though.</p>
<p>Remy Labesque, one of Tesla's designers, helped Dandelion Chocolate to invent a machine to make ideal chocolate chips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shape of a typical store-bought chocolate chip is an arbitrary result of the industrial manufacturing process used to make it. As you might expect, a drop of molten chocolate is deposited onto a flat surface and left to cool. Chocolate chip taste varies widely by brand, but the shape of the chips does not.</p>
<p>The shape of our chip is faceted: The edges of a Dandelion Chocolate chip taper to thin-as-we could-make-’em without compromising structure. This is because the thermal mass of a thin piece of chocolate melts more quickly on the palate. So when you put a Dandelion chip on your tongue, the thin, chiseled edges warm-to-melt nearly instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 lb of these chips costs 30$, not bad.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ogden's-basic-english"><a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/">Ogden's Basic English</a> <a href="#ogden's-basic-english">¶</a></h4>
<p>Apparently removing all redundancies, synonims, etc from the English language leaves us only with 850 words or so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call this simplified language Basic English, the developer is Charles K. Ogden, and was released in 1930 with the book: Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar. He founded the Orthological Institute to develop the tools for teaching Basic English. His most famous associate, I.A. Richards, led the effort in the Orient, which uses the techniques to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting bit is, that change doesn't affect the grammar, so one could learn only 850 words and yet converse in English by using its grammar to its full extent.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="brick-pencil"><a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Brick pencil</a> <a href="#brick-pencil">¶</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Doug Engelbart</a>, one of the people behind the creation of a computer mouse, and then graphical interfaces, argued about interfaces in his paper "Augmenting Human Intellect: a Conceptual Framework" in 1962 and to proof his point came up with a brick pencil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains of power equal to ours could have evolved in an environment where the combination of artifact materials and muscle strengths were so scaled that the neatest scribing tool (equivalent to a pencil, possible had a shape and mass as manageable as a brick would be to us-assuming that our muscles were not specially conditioned to deal with it. We fastened a pencil to a brick and experimented. Figure 2 shows the results, compared with typewriting and ordinary pencil writing. With the brick pencil, we are slower and less precise. If we want to hurry the writing, we have to make it larger. Also, writing the passage twice with the brick-pencil tires the untrained hand and arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/images/augment-3906/fig2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>(and now users complain that they have to click a button twice; such a shame)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="cosmic-latte"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte">Cosmic Latte</a> <a href="#cosmic-latte">¶</a></h4>
<p>Wikipedia sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cosmic latte is the average colour of the universe, found by a team of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those keen on putting this into their apps, here is the colour: #FFF8E7.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="7-up's-history"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Up#History">7-UP's history</a> <a href="#7-up's-history">¶</a></h4>
<p>In my childhood I used to love 7-UP a lot, mostly because it was nearly transparent hence felt less poisonous comparing to other sodas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1948</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably if I were to drink it until 1948 it'd be my favourite drink anyway, but not because of its (lack of) colour.</p>
<p>Also all myths about its name are hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A myth exists that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, making it acidic on the pH scale and similar to other drinks of this type. [...]<br>
The real origin of the name is unclear, though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass around 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this one makes the most sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Britvic also claims that the name is a result of the fact that 7 Up was bottled in 7-ounce bottles …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> has given rise to a new generation of chess enthusiasts. <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/"><em>How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</em></a>’s traffic quadrupled between October and November 2020, and Lichess traffic <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">jumped 10%</a> in that same span. To all the new and reengaged chess players, welcome!</p>
<p>As part of this surge of interest, many new players have sent me questions and comments on openings. What opening do I choose? Is the reason I lose because I don’t want to memorize as many openings as my opponents? What do you think about [insert opening here]?</p>
<p>Here’s my thesis:</p>
<p><em>The best opening for rapid chess improvement is the one that gets you to a comfortable middlegame position with as little work as possible<sup>1</sup></em>.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this article lays out specific, concrete openings that I’ve selected for you. They require minimal study, work against a variety of responses from your opponent, and naturally flow to comfortable middlegame positions. These are well-established, sound openings that my students have seen success with, and there are multiple openings you can choose from to suit your own chess preferences and tastes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only prerequisite is that you understand the basic opening principles of developing your pieces, controlling the center, getting your king safe (usually via castling), and connecting the rooks. <a href="https://www.chess.com/lessons/opening-principles">Chess.com’s interactive primer</a> looks good if you’re not familiar with them or need a refresher. It’s also helpful to be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic chess notation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this post is designed to help you improve without a coach, I’m taking on a few students to coach within this structure to help accelerate their improvement. If that’s something you’re interested in, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#294e485c5d4844694e485c5d484447485b5c4548074a4644">gautam[at]gautamnarula.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Openings for White</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, I quickly recommended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System">The London System</a> and moved on without elaborating much further. I’m going to go a little more in-depth about the London here, as well as offer other options (including a 1.e4 option!) for players who don’t enjoy the types of positions that emerge from the London.</p>
<p><strong><u>Opening for 1. d4 players: The London System or the Colle-Zukertort</u></strong></p>
<p>The London System features the moves 1. d4, 2. Nf3, 3. Bf4, 4. e3, followed by c3, Bd3, Nbd2 and O-O in the appropriate order depending on the opponent’s moves (Diagram 1). It has been <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1813667">deployed</a> by none other than World Champion Magnus Carlsen! It’s so difficult for Black to stop you from achieving this basic setup that it’s not necessary to write out sample lines like I do for the e4 opening below.</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 1: </strong>The ideal London System setup.</p>
<p>A cousin of the London system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_System">Colle</a>, where the pawn is pushed to e3 before the c1 bishop has moved, blocking it in. The <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1025949">Colle-Zukertort</a> is an improvement on the Colle where that bishop is fianchettoed on the queenside, and can lead to some more interesting positions than the London in my experience (Diagram 2).</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 2: </strong>The ideal Colle-Zukertort setup. Notice that compared to the London System, the f4 bishop is now on b2 and the c3 pawn push has been replaced with the b3 pawn push.</p>
<p>One example Colle-Zukertort line:</p>

<p>Some ideas for White here: placing a rook on c1 and pushing for central expansion with c2-c4, or placing a knight on e5 followed by a f2-f4 push and a potential kingside attack.</p>
<p><b><u>Opening for 1. e4 players: The King’s Indian Attack</u></b></p>
<p>1. e4 openings are inherently more difficult to play than d4 openings<sup>3</sup>, so we’ll have to spend a little more time learning my pick, the King’s Indian Attack (KIA). The KIA has a storied history, with <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008365">many stunning victories coming from a young Bobby Fischer</a> in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. It’s basically the King’s Indian Defense (which is, more or less, my recommendation as Black) with colors reversed, and the extra tempo from playing as White gives you the flexibility to play it against just about anything.</p>
<p>The KIA setup involves the moves e4, d3, Nd2, Ngf3, g3, Bg2, and 0-0, typically resulting in the structure in Diagram 3.<span><!-- [if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p><b>Diagram 3:</b> Standard KIA setup.</p>
<p>White’s king is castled and safe, and White exerts control of the center with the two pawns and knights. White’s main plan is a well-timed e4-e5 pawn push, accompanied with gaining space and potentially aiming for a kingside attack (those acquainted with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Closed_Sicilian">Closed Sicilian</a> will find these kinds of positions familiar). The main challenge is to figure out how to develop the c1 bishop efficiently.</p>
<p>Below are a few sample lines of what you might face:</p>
<p><b>1…e5 (King’s Pawn Game)</b></p>

<p><b>1…c5 <strong>(Sicilian Defense)</strong></b></p>

<p><strong>1…e6 (French Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…c6 (Caro-Kann Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…d5 (Scandinavian Defense)</strong></p>
<p>The Scandinavian used to be a great surprise opening and rare enough that in years past I wouldn’t have included it here, but thanks to the valiant efforts of IM John Bartholomew and #teamscandi it’s become pretty popular at the amateur level (and I’ve been recommending a Scandi variant to my students for over a decade as well, so naturally my massive influence has popularized it and shifted the frontiers of chess at both the amateur and professional levels). Unfortunately, you can’t go into a standard KIA structure (1. e4 d5 2. d3 dxe4 3.dxe4 Qxe1+ 4. Kxe1 and clearly this is a very different kind of game).</p>
<p>So instead, my suggestion is to exchange the pawns and bring the knight to c3 followed by the KIA style fianchetto.</p>
<p> You can do the same against 3…Qd6, which I recommend for Black below. White has a flexible and comfortable position and aim to exert more central control with Rf1-e1 and potentially maneuvering one of the knights to e4.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Opening for 1. c4 Players: Read a Book</strong></span></p>
<p>I said it in How to Get Good at Chess, Fast and I’ll say it again: you’re on your own. Being a hipster has its costs. Truth hurts! I’ve heard good things about <a href="https://amzn.to/38xREcp">Starting Out: The English</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Openings for Black</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, for Black I recommended a kingside fianchetto setup involving the moves Nf6, g6, d6, Bg7, and O-O (Diagram 4). I’ll elaborate on that here. I also offer an alternative option, the Qd6 Scandinavian + …g6 Slav, for those who prefer to contest for central control right away rather than let White immediately build up a center.</p>
<p><strong><u>Kingside Fianchetto</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Diagram 4: </strong>The basic kingside fianchetto structure.</p>
<p>The idea behind this structure is its flexibility. You can strike in the center with …e5 and …Nc6, potentially following up with a kingside attack. You can play more on the queenside with …Nbd7 and …c5, potentially transposing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence">Sicilian</a> line.</p>
<p>Experienced players might point out that this could lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defense">King’s Indian Defense</a> (KID) or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirc_defense">Pirc Defense</a>, which turn out to be rather complicated openings. This is true, but you can play both these openings with little theoretical knowledge up to the 1600 level and still be fine. The main idea you need to be aware of is avoiding getting overrun in the center with a well timed …e5 or …c5 push if white is building up a central pawn phalanx. Here are a few sample lines which show this idea.</p>
<p>The King’s Indian Defense:</p>
 <p><span>Notice Black plays 4…d6 rather than castling first, makes it more uncomfortable for white to kick the knight around with 5. e5 (5. e5 dxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ 7. Nxd1 Ne4 is much more comfortable for Black). Black also plays 6…e5 to strike back at the center. If White plays 7.d5, Black has the logical move 7… Nbd7 with the goal of trying to secure the c5 square for the knight.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the main line of the KID, and I included it here so you can see the ideas in action – White has the option of building up a strong center against the fianchetto system<sup>2</sup> and Black <em>must</em> counterstrike in the center to avoid an uncomfortable and inferior position. On the flipside, White has to watch out for the fianchettoed g7 bishop – many games are decided by tactics against a rook on a1 or a knight on c3. </span></p>
<p>For e4, we have the Pirc Defense:</p>
<p> Similar ideas here: strike back at the center ..c5 or …e5 at the appropriate moment. A related idea is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog_(chess)">Hedgehog structure</a>, which is also surprisingly resilient.</p>
<p>You may also want to review opposite side castling attacks, which could happen if White decides to castle queenside instead. These games are a lot of fun but can get a bit crazy!</p>
<p><strong><u>The g6 Slav + Qd6 Scandinavian</u></strong></p>
<p>Some of my student’s have seen great results with kingside fianchetto structures, but I’ll admit these structures can result in games that are a bit intense. This is a quieter alternative that’s still easy to learn and leads to interesting positions.</p>
<p>Against d4, my recommendation is the g6 Slav (my engine tells me this is called the Schlechter Variation), which almost always will go 1…d5 2…c6 3….Nf7 4…g6, typically with …Bg7 and …O-O to follow <strong>(Diagram 5)</strong></p>

<p>One typical variation could go:</p>

<p>Another is to exchange the pawns on d5:</p>

<p>A variant of this plan is for White is to pressure d5 with Qb3 and Bg5 to force Black to play e6 and lock in the c8 bishop:</p>

<p>Black gets a flexible position and, by not committing a pawn to e6 early like in other similar openings (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Slav_Defense">Semi-Slav</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence">French</a>), leaves the possibility open in non-Qb3 variations for developing the c8 bishop to a good square and only then playing e6 to support the d5 focal point in the center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against e4, my recommendation is the Qd6 Scandinavian, which begins with 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 (Diagram 6).</p>

      <p>Growing a newsletter is the hardest part about running a successful newsletter. No matter if you're just starting out or if your newsletter has 10k+ subscribers. It doesn't get easier, but there are many ways to that can facilitate growth.</p><p>Growth by organic ways like word of mouth is possible but only works if you already people talking about your newsletter. It isn't the most viable solution in the beginning.</p><p>To reach a wider audience you'll have to go where your audience dwells, you can start with Twitter, Reddit, Quora, &nbsp;IndieHackers, or communties on Slack and Discord. These channels have a diversified audience but is only one of the many tools a newsletter creator has in their tool chest of growth. One of the best solutions is to list your newsletter in newsletter directories. It's very similar to the classifieds we see on newspapers but focused towards newsletters.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><p>Submitting your newsletter to directories have multi-fold benefits. Below are all of the benefits you'll receive when you submit your newsletter to a directory.</p><h3 id="seo">SEO</h3><p>SEO is one of the most sought after growth avenues for newsletters. When you submit your newsletter to a directory you'll receive SEO in the form of a backlink to your newsletter.</p><p>What does that mean? When someone searches for anything on Google or any search engine, they usually place sites with the most backlinks at the top. It takes months and years to build up sufficient backlinks to rank for popular search phrases that your newsletter wants to compete for.</p><p>SEO is the long game and submitting your newsletter to all 21+ newsletter directories gives your newsletter a backlink boost.</p><p>The main goal of a newsletter directory is to help others discover amazing newsletters to read. This usually means that they want to spread the word as far as possible. Most newsletter directories have multiple social media accounts and will usually share to their audience any new newsletter that's submitted. It's nothing crazy in terms of growth, but it does give a little boost.</p><p>Most newsletter directories provide ways for visitors to share your newsletter to their audience as well, adding to the compounding effect.</p><h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3><p>Newsletter directories sole purpose is to help people find the best newsletters to read in any category they're interested in. Capitalize on the interest of those visitors by submitting your newsletter.

<p>

Last month, the Swiss parliamentary intelligence oversight committee published a report about its investigation into the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG" target="_blank">Crypto AG</a>, the former Swiss manufacturer of encryption systems that was secretly owned by the CIA and the German BND.</p><p>

The committee found that the Swiss foreign intelligence service knew about this covert ownership since 1993 and used its knowledge to decrypt foreign communications, but failed to inform the responsible minister about the case.</p><p>

Here I will provide a translation of the <a href="#summary"><b>summary of this report</b></a> as well as some interesting <a href="#details"><b>additional details</b></a> from the rest of the committee's report about Crypto AG in relation to the Swiss government. </p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QpCV-qwbU_k/X8-IxtBLbuI/AAAAAAAAE6s/3C5UyJ-YGcslnaJAyIZ9St7ZuWZKich-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/schweiz-cryptoreport-header.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-original-height="375" data-original-width="800" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QpCV-qwbU_k/X8-IxtBLbuI/AAAAAAAAE6s/3C5UyJ-YGcslnaJAyIZ9St7ZuWZKich-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/schweiz-cryptoreport-header.jpg" width="600"></a></p>


<p><span size="+2">Summary of the Crypto AG report</span></p><p>

The Swiss parliamentary <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/en/organe/delegations/control-delegation" target="_blank">audit committee</a> for national security and the intelligence services (German: <i>Geschäftsprüfungsdelegation</i> or GPDel) started its investigation on February 13, 2020 and <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx?lang=1031" target="_blank">published</a> its 64-page report about the Crypto AG case on November 10, in a <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/centers/documents/fr/bericht-gpdel-2020-11-10-f.pdf" target="_blank">French (pdf)</a> and a <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/centers/documents/_layouts/15/DocIdRedir.aspx?ID=DOCID-1-10177" target="_blank">German (pdf)</a> version.</p><p>

Below is a translation of the summary of this report, made from the German version by using Google Translate with the necessary manual corrections. I added some links and additional details in square brackets, as well as subheadings in bold italics for easier navigation of the text.</p><hr>
<br>
<blockquote>
<span size="+2"><b>The case of Crypto AG</b></span><br>
<b>Report of the audit committee of the Federal Assembly</b><p>

from November 2, 2020</p><hr>
  <br>
<span size="+1"><b>The essentials in brief</b></span><p>



Since the Fall of 1993, the Strategic Intelligence Service (German: <i>Strategischer Nachrichtendienst</i> or SND) managed to get reliable information about Crypto AG. It learned that the company was owned by foreign intelligence agencies and exported "weak" devices, the encryption of which could be broken with a realistic effort.</p><p>
  
In order to be able to break the encryption of such devices itself, the SND began to gather technical information about their encryption methods and customer lists. Later, when the SND had become a civilian office, it managed to get enduring access to this knowledge with the consent of the American intelligence agencies.</p><p>


  <b><i>Legal situation</i></b></p><p>
  
From a legal point of view, the parliamentary audit committee (GPDel) therefore sees it as an intelligence cooperation, like in the past it was provided in the military law and today in the Intelligence Service Act (<a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20120872/index.html" target="_blank"><i>Nachrichtendienstgesetz</i></a> or NDG). From the fact that the SND and the American agencies acted by mutual agreement, it follows that the Swiss authorities share responsibility for the activities of Crypto AG.</p><p>
  
  It was legally allowed that the SND and a foreign intelligence agency used a company in Switzerland to gather information about foreign countries. Given the big political implications of this cooperation, however, the GPDel considers it wrong that except for the current head of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Department_of_Defence,_Civil_Protection_and_Sport" target="_blank">Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport</a> (VBS) none of her predecessors were informed about this operation.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZzaY3KfJV0w/X8h56h9Gb8I/AAAAAAAAE6I/QeCtATNYbXw7Dxl9MTr6M6KHTjzU2cd0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s941/schweiz-defensedept.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-original-height="666" data-original-width="941" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZzaY3KfJV0w/X8h56h9Gb8I/AAAAAAAAE6I/QeCtATNYbXw7Dxl9MTr6M6KHTjzU2cd0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s941/schweiz-defensedept.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

</p>
<p>

<b><i>Police investigation </i></b></p><p>

In addition, the SND's findings on Crypto AG during the <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/people/buehler/hans.htm" target="_blank">Bühler affair</a>, which was investigated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_of_Police" target="_blank">federal police</a> (<i>Bundespolizei</i> or BuPo) in 1994 and 1995, should not have been withheld from the political leadership. The head of the federal military department (EMD) at the time did not learn the truth about Crypo AG via other ways either, as he explained to the GPDel.</p><p>
  
  The GPDel also did not found any evidence that the government unduly influenced the investigations by the BuPo. Rather, the head of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Department_of_Justice_and_Police" target="_blank">Federal Department of Justice and Police</a> (EJPD) made an effort to clarify the ownership of the company. Ultimately, however, the BuPo had to stop its investigations without being able to answer this question. </p><p>

In 1994, the GPDel was informed repeatedly about the ongoing investigations of the BuPo. Just like the military and political superiors of the SND, the GPDel did not learn anything from the foreign intelligence service related to Crypto AG. The company was never subject of the information provided by the Defense Department (VBS) when the overall supervisor specifically dealt with the topic of cryptology in 2007 and 2009. </p><p>


<b><i>Storage and destruction of documents related to Crypto AG</i></b></p><p>

Especially valuable for the inspection of the GPDel were the operational files of the SND and the BuPo, which the federal intelligence service (<i>Nachrichtendienst des Bundes</i> or NDB) stored in a converted <i>K-Anlage</i> [<i>Kriegsanlage</i>, a well-hidden former <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/operation-rubikon-das-steckt-in-den-geheimen-crypto-akten-aus-dem-kommandobunker-ld.1584366" target="_blank">command bunker</a> of the Swiss army near Bern]. Their archiving in accordance with the applicable regulations is still pending. Due to the archiving practice of the intelligence services, however, there is no guarantee that all important documents are still available. </p><p>
  
  The destruction of such records was in part allowed by law and regulations, but in some cases it contradicted them. Between 2011 and 2014, the NDB destroyed documents from their correspondence with foreign partner services, instead of storing them internally as prescribed. Its inspection showed the GPDel that the destruction of files by the intelligence service is not an effective method for source protection. Rather, there is a risk that former sources can be compromised when authorities don't have the proper information. </p><p>



<b><i>Foreign espionage under the guise of a Swiss company</i></b></p><p>

Companies and organizations that operate on Swiss soil benefit from Switzerland's image as a neutral state. Accordingly, foreign intelligence services may have an interest to operate under the guise of a Swiss company to the detriment of other countries.</p><p>
  
Under certain circumstances, such a company can be guilty of the criminal offense of
forbidden intelligence service against foreign states. However, such an operation
is permissible under applicable law when a foreign agency uses such a company together with the NDB to collect information about foreign countries (cf. Art. 34 Para. 2 NDG).</p><p>
  
  In the view of the GPDel, planning such an operation should include a political assessment of the possible consequences for Switzerland, as well as for any affected employees of the company. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_%28Switzerland%29" target="_blank">Federal Council</a> (<i>Bundesrat</i>) should therefore clarify in principle how much room for maneuver it wants to grant the Defense Department (VBS) in this regard.</p><p>


<b><i>Not enough attention for the supply of secure encryption devices</i></b></p><p>

The case of Crypto AG shows that companies under the influence of foreign intelligence services can produce devices with “weak” encryption methods. However, the GPDel assumes that Crypto AG has never supplied the “weak” encryption equipment to the Swiss authorities. Important in this case was that the Swiss authorities were able to inspect the security of the purchased devices or even influence their design. However, this is only possible with suppliers who develop and manufacture their devices in Switzerland.</p><p>
  
  For security reasons, it is not responsible for the federal government to purchase encryption solutions from foreign suppliers. Right from the start, the Federal Council did not pay the necessary attention to the role that domestic suppliers play in ensuring the availability of secure encryption technology for the Swiss authorities. As the responsible department, the Defense Department (VBS) didn't analyze the risks for a reliable supply in time and informed the Federal Council about this matter.</p><p>



<b><i>Access to Crypto AG at the management of the intelligence services</i></b></p><p>

The information access to the Crypto AG was a well-kept secret at the management level of the SND. But when the Federal Intelligence and Security Service (NDB) was created [in 2010], this knowledge remained hidden for its first director. When confronted with this a few years later, he refused to take his responsibility.</p><p>

It was only in the summer of 2019 that the current director commissioned a position paper for this case, although he was not informed by his predecessor and it was still before the NDB learned from the research of the media about Crypto AG. However, he did not use this informational advantage to uncover the  relations between Crypto AG, the NDB's predecessors and the American intelligence agencies. Instead of clarifying the legal situation and recognizing the political implications, the NDB downplayed the relevance of the Crypto AG case for the current organisation. </p><p>

The Defense Department (VBS), which already informed the Federal Council and the GPDel in November 2019, did not succeed in identifying the need for political action. The interdepartmental working group, which the VBS also set up, was not able to support the political leadership because of the reluctance of the NDB to provide information for the looming intelligence affair. </p><p>

In its application for the Federal Council meeting on December 20, 2019, the Defense Department asserted that the level of information was insufficient for a substantive discussion about the case of Crypto AG. After finding the files in the <i>K-Anlage</i>, about which the Defense Department had informed the Federal Council, this finding was no longer valid.</p><p>
  
  Since the NDB had not evaluated the extensive files before the Federal Council meeting, the Council decided to establish an external committee of experts to clarify the apparently purely historical questions. With this, the Federal Council gave the strategic leadership for dealing with the Crypto AG case of the hand from the start. </p><p>



<b><i>Ending the parallel investigation by judge Oberholzer</i></b></p><p>

When the GPDel opened its inspection on February 13, 2020, former federal judge [Niklaus] Oberholzer had been active as an external expert on behalf of the Federal Council for a month, but without having access to the files from the <i>K-Anlage</i>. After the GPDel had requested all relevant files from the NDB, it recognized that the Crypto AG …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>What happens when we get or set an attribute of a Python object? This question is not as simple as it may seem at first. It is true that any experienced Python programmer has a good intuitive understanding of how attributes work, and the documentation helps a lot to strengthen the understanding. Yet, when a really non-trivial question regarding attributes comes up, the intuition fails and the documentation can no longer help. To gain a deep understanding and be able to answer such questions, one has to study how attributes are implemented. That's what we're going to do today.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>A quick refresher</h2>
<p><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">Last time</a> we studied how the Python object system works. Some of the things we've learned in that part are crucial for our current discussion, so let's recall them briefly.</p>
<p>A Python object is an instance of a C struct that has at least two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every object must have a type because the type determines how the object behaves. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>

<p>The members of a type are called slots. Each slot is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example, the <code>tp_call</code> slot of a type specifies what happens when we call the objects of that type. Some slots are grouped together in suites. An example of a suite is the "number" suite <code>tp_as_number</code>. Last time we studied its <code>nb_add</code> slot that specifies how to add objects. This and all other slots are very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">described</a> in the docs.</p>
<p>How slots of a type are set depends on how the type is defined. There are two ways to define a type in CPython:</p>
<ul>
<li>statically; or</li>
<li>dynamically.</li>
</ul>
<p>A statically defined type is just a statically initialized instance of <code>PyTypeObject</code>. All built-in types are defined statically. Here's, for example, the definition of the <code>float</code> type:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>PyFloat_Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>PyType_Type</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

</pre></div>


<p>To dynamically allocate a new type, we call a metatype. A metatype is a type whose instances are types. It determines how types behave. In particular, it creates new type instances. Python has one built-in metatype known as <code>type</code>. It's the metatype of all built-in types. It's also used as the default metatype to create classes. When CPython executes the <code>class</code> statement, it typically calls <code>type()</code> to create the class. We can create a class by calling <code>type()</code> directly as well:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>MyClass</span> <span>=</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>bases</span><span>,</span> <span>namespace</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>tp_new</code> slot of <code>type</code> is called to create a class. The implementation of this slot is the <code>type_new()</code> function. This function allocates the type object and sets it up.</p>
<p>Slots of a statically defined type are specified explicitly. Slots of a class are set automatically by the metatype. Both statically and dynamically defined types can inherit some slots from its bases.</p>
<p>Some slots are mapped to special methods. If a class defines a special method that corresponds to some slot, CPython automatically sets the slot to the default implementation that calls the special method. This is why we can add objects whose class defines <code>__add__()</code>. CPython does the reverse for a statically defined type. If such a type implements a slot that corresponds to some special method, CPython sets the special method to the implementation that wraps the slot. This is how the <code>int</code> type gets its <code>__add__()</code> special method.</p>
<p>All types must be initialized by calling the <code>PyType_Ready()</code> function. This function does a lot of things. For example, it does slot inheritance and adds special methods based on slots. For a class, <code>PyType_Ready()</code> is called by <code>type_new()</code>. For a statically defined type, <code>PyType_Ready()</code> must be called explicitly. When CPython starts, it calls <code>PyType_Ready()</code> for each built-in type.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let's turn our attention to attributes.</p>
<h2>Attributes and the VM</h2>
<p>What is an attribute? We might say that an attribute is a variable associated with an object, but it's more than that. It's hard to give a definition that captures all important aspects of attributes. So, instead of starting with a definition, let's start with something we know for sure.</p>
<p>We know for sure that in Python we can do three things with attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>get the value of an attribute: <code>value = obj.attr</code></li>
<li>set an attribute to some value: <code>obj.attr = value</code></li>
<li>delete an attribute: <code>del obj.attr</code></li>
</ul>
<p>What these operations do depends, like any other aspect of the object's behavior, on the object's type. A type has certain slots responsible for getting, setting and deleting attributes. The VM calls these slots to execute the statements like <code>value = obj.attr</code> and <code>obj.attr = value</code>. To see how the VM does that and what these slots are, let's apply the familiar method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a piece of code that gets/sets/deletes an attribute.</li>
<li>Disassemble it to bytecode using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html"><code>dis</code></a> module.</li>
<li>Take a look at the implementation of the produced bytecode instructions in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c"><code>ceval.c</code></a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Getting an attribute</h3>
<p>Let's first see what the VM does when we get the value of an attribute. The compiler produces the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-LOAD_ATTR"><code>LOAD_ATTR</code></a> opcode to load the value:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ echo 'obj.attr' | python -m dis
  1           0 LOAD_NAME           …</pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <h2 id="rational"><a href="#rational"></a> Rational</h2>
<p>In my last blog-post <a href="https://weisser-zwerg.dev/posts/investing-abstract-view">Investing: Abstract View</a> I described a high level view on trading and the possibilities you have
available for implementing your trading strategies.</p>
<p>Since I’ve read Andreas F. Clenow’s books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Andreas-F-Clenow/dp/1118410858">Following the Trend: Diversified Managed Futures Trading</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Andreas-F-Clenow/dp/109198378X">Trading Evolved</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am sold on the idea that the only “proper” way to implement trading strategies is to use financial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract">futures</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Futures provide you with a single interface to a wide variety of financial assets: stocks/equities, commodities (agricultural and non-agricultural),
interest rates (bonds) and currencies.</li>
<li>Futures naturally exist as long and short. Whenever you buy a future contract somebody else sells that contract or vice versa, so they always exist
as pairs. This means that you can easily go short on any asset for which a future exists. In stock trading this is not the case. Even, if in
principle you are able to <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/0071759344">short-sell</a> stocks, in practice exactly at the time when you’d like to
short-sell you cannot, because nobody lends you the stocks you want to short-sell or even worse you have to get out of your short position, because
the lender of your stock wants his stock back and he can demand that on a daily basis. Short selling is essential for some strategies like
<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantopian/research_public/blob/master/notebooks/lectures/Introduction_to_Pairs_Trading/notebook.ipynb">pairs-trading</a>
and you do not want to be restricted in your implementation of your ideas by technical shortcomings.</li>
<li>When you stay with stocks/equities the level of diversification is severely hampered. In finance this is called <a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/correlation-tightening/15102122">correlation
tightening</a>: “In falling markets, the only thing that rises is correlation.”
When you talk to banks and they propose an investment strategy to you they talk about how a well diversified portfolio can protect you from the worst
downturns. At the same time they neglect to mention that in principle they’re right, but in practice you cannot achieve diversification as long as
you stay with stocks/equities. As soon as you switch over to the universe of exchange traded futures you have a much wider variety of products to
trade and you actually <strong>CAN</strong> achieve diversification.</li>
<li>Trading futures is cheaper from a transaction cost perspective. Futures typically exist in large quantities, but trading one such large quantity
costs 2€ or less.</li>
<li>When trading futures you only need a fraction of the capital you would need if you invested in stocks/equities. You only have to provide the initial
margin, which is typically a small fraction of the nominal position value.</li>
<li>… read Andreas’ books to discover more reasons …</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are also a couple of downsides to using financial futures like the fact that you have to regularly roll your positions or how they are
treated from a tax perspective in your jurisdiction, but I consider those issues to be purely technical issues that can be overcome. All in all I do
not understand why neither advisors at banks nor financial journalists advertise the advantages of futures trading much more. Everybody always only
talks about stocks and never about the extended universe you can access via futures. In case you don’t plan to trade futures yourself you could make
use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertakings_for_Collective_Investment_in_Transferable_Securities_Directive_2009">UCITS</a> funds like (just as an
example) the <a href="https://www.almacapital.com/funds/quantica-managed-futures/">Alma (Platinum) Quantica Managed Futures</a> fund (or any other UCITS futures
fund) to participate in the extended universe that futures offer.</p>
<p>I did not want to take Andreas’ word for granted on how great futures are and so I implemented the trading strategies he desribed in “Trading Evolved”
myself. Below you can find the step by step instructions to follow to create the required set-up. In a next blog post I’ll then report about the
results of replicating Andreas’ futures trading strategies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disclaimer: I will mention some commercial offerings just to make it easier for you to get started. I am not profiting in any way from doing so.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="why%3F"><a href="#why%3F"></a> Why?</h3>
<p>You might ask yourself why the following is relevant? Even after reading Andreas’ books, which are very well written, it was still quite some effort
to assemble and compile all the relevant information to get started with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp">backtesting</a>. It seems
that the naming of future contracts is not as standardized as the naming of stocks (using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Securities_Identification_Number">ISIN</a>). It took me quite some time to find the contracts that Andreas
mentioned in his books and cross check their characteristics (like the <code>Full Point Value</code> and the corresponding <code>multiplier</code> and <code>minor_fx_adj</code> values
in zipline).</p>
<p>Some information sources that helped me in the context of CSI Data were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSI Data <a href="http://www.csidata.com/factsheets.php?type=commodity&amp;format=htmltable&amp;exchangeid=">Factsheet</a> gives you a comprehensive overview of all
(futures) data that CSI provides.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.csidata.com/?page_id=3271">Point and Tick Values</a> definitions as given by CSI Data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environments%3A-linux-and-windows"><a href="#environments%3A-linux-and-windows"></a> Environments: Linux and Windows</h3>
<p>I implemented the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp">backtesting</a> via <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">zipline</a> on
Linux. In principle all of the backtesting environment is independent of the operating system, but in practice I used symbolic links in several places
of my implementation, which Windows does not support (MacOSX is fine). You would have to modify the code in those places to make the code run on
Windows, too.</p>
<p>To download the futures data from CSI you need a Windows machine or <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VM</a> available, because CSI only allows the download
of data via its rich-client <code>Unfair Advantage</code> software (see below).</p>
<h2 id="quantopian%3A-zipline"><a href="#quantopian%3A-zipline"></a> Quantopian: Zipline</h2>
<p>Andreas uses <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">Quantopian: Zipline</a> as his back testing environment for the python programming language. In
addition he suggests to use futures data from <a href="http://www.csidata.com/">CSI</a>. CSI describes itself as: “a low cost information vendor of summary world
financial market data.” In order to make the data from CSI available to zipline you have to write a zipline <code>bundle</code>. Below I’ll describe the whole
set-up process.</p>
<h3 id="anaconda"><a href="#anaconda"></a> Anaconda</h3>
<p>As a first step, please install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads">Anaconda</a>. Anaconda is a package manager for python and
data-science packages.</p>
<h3 id="andreas_clenow_trading_evolved"><a href="#andreas_clenow_trading_evolved"></a> andreas_clenow_trading_evolved</h3>
<p>Next clone the <a href="https://github.com/cs224/andreas_clenow_trading_evolved">andreas_clenow_trading_evolved</a> github project:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone https://github.com/cs224/andreas_clenow_trading_evolved.git
&gt; cd andreas_clenow_trading_evolved
</code></pre>
<p>and use the scripts in <code>0000-py36zl-conda-env</code> to create the <code>py36zl</code> python/anaconda environment:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd 0000-py36zl-conda-env
&gt; ./env-create.sh
</code></pre>
<p>You can switch into this environment via:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; conda activate py36zl
</code></pre>
<p>Andreas describes in his book the steps you have to manually perform to fix a couple of minor issues in zipline for making it ready to handle futures
data. To spare you the trouble I’ve forked zipline from the quantopian original and have applied the changes. You can see the differences here:
<a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/compare/master...cs224:20201009-modifications">cs224:20201009-modifications</a></p>
<p>In order to install this version of zipline make sure you’ve activated the <code>py36zl</code> environment as described above and then execute:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone https://github.com/cs224/zipline.git
&gt; cd zipline
&gt; git checkout 20201009-modifications
&gt; pip install -e .
</code></pre>
<h3 id="csi-data"><a href="#csi-data"></a> CSI Data</h3>
<p>Before going into details on how to ingest data for use in zipline you have to have some data. I personally bought the <a href="https://csidata2.com/cgi-bin/ua_order_form_nw.pl">History
Only</a> package (click on the “History Only” “Subscription Type”) for “World Futures” for 20
years. This is 350 USD, which is not bad.</p>
<p>Once you have the data you have to download and instlal the <a href="http://www.csidata.com/?page_id=55">Unfair Advantage</a> software package. I
suggest that you use one of the “(Software + Database)” packages. Once you have installed <code>Unfair Advantage</code> you have to download the data you want
via this application and you have to do that within 30 days. The <code>Unfair Advantage</code> software is an old Windows native application and it is damn slow!
For only 100 base symbols expect to wait something like 3 to 6 hours. For the full futures database expect 48 to 72 hours. Actually the download speed
degrades over time. It might be useful to split the symbols you want into chuncks and then download chuck by chunck. I’ve written to the CSI support
to report my issues and they mentioned that they’re working on a new version of this software. Hopefully they release this new version soon.</p>
<p>Actually the <code>Unfair Advantage</code> UI is overwhelming. I only used the feature to define a portfolio by providing a space separated list of base symbols
that you can find via the CSI Data <a href="http://www.csidata.com/factsheets.php?type=commodity&amp;format=htmltable&amp;exchangeid=">Factsheet</a> and then exported
the portfolio as a CSV. I initally tried to export as an excel file, but ran into trouble, e.g. go for the CSV/ASCII export!</p>
<p>The default data-format is <code>DNOHLCviVI</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>D = Date</li>
<li>N = Delivery Number</li>
<li>O = Open</li>
<li>H = High</li>
<li>L = Low</li>
<li>C = Close</li>
<li>v = contract volume</li>
<li>i = contract open interest</li>
<li>V = total volume</li>
<li>I = total open interest</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use the <code>csi_futures_data</code> bundle that I’ll introduce below you need to keep that format.</p>
<p>As a start I suggest you open the file <code>futures_markets_lookup.xlsx</code> and copy the symbols from the <code>csi_symbol</code> column and make a portfolio of those
symbols in the <code>Unfair Advantage</code> application. You can then download the data for those symbols. This should generate a file system hierarchy as follows:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── AC
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_0000$_Spot.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005M.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005N.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005Q.CSV

└── YM
    ├── YM_0000$.CSV
    ├── YM_2000Z.CSV
    ├── YM_2001H.CSV
...
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have that file hierarchy you can use the <code>csi_futures_data</code> bundle to ingest that data.</p>
<h3 id="csi_futures_data-bundle"><a href="#csi_futures_data-bundle"></a> csi_futures_data bundle</h3>
<p>Above you already cloned the <a href="https://github.com/cs224/andreas_clenow_trading_evolved">andreas_clenow_trading_evolved</a> github project. In that project
you’ll also find a <code>csi_futures_data</code> sub-folder. In there is a symbolic link that will point to <code>PATH_TO_YOUR_CSI_DATA_DIRECTORY</code>. As the name
suggests you have to set this link to point to the real CSI data directory.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd csi_futures_data
&gt; rm data
&gt; ln -s PATH_TO_YOUR_REAL_CSI_DATA_DIRECTORY data
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you’ve activated the zipline anaconda environment.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; conda activate py36zl
</code></pre>
<p>And then execute the shell script <code>install_csi_futures_data.sh</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ./install_csi_futures_data.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This shell script will install or overwrite the file <code>$HOME/.zipline/extension.py</code>. In case you use zipline only for working with the …</p></article></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>When you started your hunt for a new project management software, you most likely considered several tools. And now, you’re weighing in the pros and cons of Asana vs Trello.</p><p>As someone who has used both the tools extensively for several periods, I’m going to go in-depth to help you decide which tool you should pick for your team.</p><p>Let’s jump in.</p><hr><h2 id="asana-vs-trello">Asana vs Trello</h2><p>Asana takes a task-oriented approach to project management where the main unit of work is a task. Trello is a project management software where everything is a card. It mimics a real-life Kanban Board that you’d have with sticky notes on different columns.</p><p>Trello is simple and easy to use. But you’re likely to feel like you’ve hit a wall as your team expands. Asana on the other hand is relatively harder to get started but has more capabilities than Trello.</p><p>Before we jump into the details, let’s take a quick overview of Asana and Trello.</p><hr><h2 id="quick-overview-of-trello">Quick Overview of Trello</h2><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-logo.png" alt="Trello logo" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-logo.png 600w"></figure><p>Trello was founded in 2011 and launched in Techcrunch Disrupt. Founded by <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> and Michael Pryor, Trello quickly became popular among many teams and individuals alike.</p><p>In 2017, Atlassian, the maker of JIRA, acquired Trello. After all, a lot of development teams would often compare <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/jira-vs-trello/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">Trello vs JIRA</a>, begin using Trello, but naturally switch to JIRA when they need more functionalities. However, this is changing. With tools like <a href="https://zepel.io/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">Zepel</a> having a perfect balance between Trello and JIRA, more teams are less inclined to use JIRA.</p><p>When it was founded, Trello was possibly the only tool that took a radically different approach to project management. Instead of focussing on projects, Trello decided to focus more on the workflow of the task. This meant, Trello had only three things — Boards, Lists (or Columns), and Cards.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-board.png" alt="Trello board" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-board.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-board.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/trello-board.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-board.png 1999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Trello Board</figcaption></figure><p>Since Trello mimics an actual <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/kanban/what-are-kanban-boards/">Kanban Board</a>, it gives teams the flexibility to consider each board as a project by itself. Columns represent the statuses through which each card would flow through. And the actual discussions and collaboration happen inside the card.</p><p>In plain words, if you or your team used a Kanban Board with sticky notes at your office (when people used to go to offices), then using Trello will be super easy for you.</p><p>The visual approach to project management by Trello enables you and your team to quickly see “<em>who is doing what</em>”.</p><p>By organizing your Trello board by different statuses of progress, you can move each card from one column to another as progress is made on that specific task.</p><p>For example, if you’re using Trello for web development, you might name each column as “<em>Todo</em>”, “<em>Prioritized</em>”, “<em>In Progress</em>”, “<em>Reviewed</em>”, and “<em>Done</em>”. You’d add each task under the “<em>Todo</em>” column and as you make progress on each task, you’d move it from one status to another till it’s moved to “<em>Done</em>”. </p><p>Of course, you can choose to edit the names of the columns to meet your team’s needs.</p><p>When you want to have discussions, set due dates, assign a card to a teammate, add labels, upload attachments, and descriptions, you can open up each card to add them.</p><hr><h2 id="quick-overview-of-asana">Quick Overview of Asana</h2><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-logo.png" alt="Asana logo" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-logo.png 600w"></figure><p>Asana was started by former Facebook founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</a> and early Facebook employee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rosenstein">Justin Rosenstein</a> in 2008. It was kept in private beta for almost four years before they launched commercially for the public in April 2012.</p><p>Asana is centred around projects. Within each project you create, you can create sections to categorize tasks. Each task can have subtasks, descriptions, assignees, tags, comments, and custom fields.</p><p>However, if you want to view a nestled view of all the tasks and subtasks, that is not possible.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-boards.png" alt="Boards in Asana" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/asana-boards.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/asana-boards.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-boards.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Boards in Asana</figcaption></figure><p>After you’ve selected/created a project, you can create tasks by clicking on the plus button from the top. To add other details to the task, clicking on the specific task will open its details panel from the right of your screen. This detailed view of the task will also have a timeline of all the activities of the tasks.</p><p>You can choose to view these tasks either in List, Board, Timeline, or Calendar view. All comments and other notifications related to the project are collected in a separate tab inside Asana called the “Inbox”.</p><hr><h2 id="views-and-other-features">Views and other features</h2><p>Trello primarily being a <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">kanban software</a>, doesn’t come with any other views built-in. All you’ve got is a kanban board view and that’s it. If you want other views such as Gantt or calendar, you can choose to use one of their 3rd-party “power-ups”. However, there are no power-ups to view everything in one single list. And you might end up paying a lot for it (more on this later).</p><p>Asana, on the other hand, has several views baked-in to the product. It comes with views such as List, Board, Calendar, and Timeline (Gantt). But their pricing plans restrict you to List, Board, and Calendar views on the free plan.</p><p>Of course, other features such as assignees, due dates, comments, tags, file attachments, and integrations are available on both Asana and Trello. You should note that only Trello allows you to add multiple assignees for a task similar to <a href="https://zepel.io/">Zepel</a>.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Purely based on the number of features and views available, Asana is a clear winner compared to Trello.</p><hr><h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><p>First things first. I’m sure you’re already aware of this, but I thought I should mention it anyway. You shouldn’t have to choose project management primarily based on pricing and sacrifice your team’s productivity.</p><p>If you’re getting more capabilities out of a tool and your team requires those capabilities to perform at their best, then a few $$ shouldn’t come in their way. But of course, if the capabilities of a <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/free-project-management-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">free project management software</a> are good enough for your team for now, then great!</p><p>With that out of the way, let’s compare the pricing of Trello vs Asana.</p><h3 id="trello-pricing">Trello Pricing</h3><p>Much like many project management tools, Trello also follows a freemium pricing model. They provide you with a certain set of basic features for free. But when you need more capabilities and power, you’ll have to start paying them.</p><p>Trello’s pricing starts at <strong>$0 with a limited set of features</strong> and works its way up to <strong>$9.99 per member per month</strong> (when paid annually) or <strong>$12.50 per member per month</strong> (when paid monthly). Trello’s enterprise plan starts at <strong>$17.50 per member per month</strong>.</p><p>A point to note about Trello’s free plan is it’s <strong>free for unlimited users</strong>. They begin per user to charge only when you need more features.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png" alt="Pricing comparison Asana vs Trello" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 2260w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Trello pricing</figcaption></figure><p>As you start using Trello more frequently, you’re likely to want to use their premium features and end up paying for it. Some features you might want to pay for include higher limits on file attachments, custom fields, and more number of power-ups.</p><p>For example, on the free plan, you can use only one power-up per board. This can become tricky if you want to add more views like Calendar or Gantt using Trello’s power-ups. Not only will pay extra for Trello to use more power-ups, but you might also have pay to the 3rd parties who built the power-ups.</p><h3 id="asana-pricing">Asana Pricing</h3><p>Asana’s pricing plans also follow a freemium model.</p><p>Asana’s pricing starts at <strong>$0 for a limited set of features for 15 members.</strong> Its premium plan costs <strong>$10.99 per member per month</strong> (when paid annually) or <strong>$13.49 per member per month</strong> (when paid monthly). Business plan costs <strong>$24.99 per member per month</strong> (when paid annually) or <strong>$30.49 per member per month</strong> (when paid monthly). If you want an enterprise plan, you’ll have to contact their sales team.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png" alt="Comparing pricing of Trello vs Asana" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 2272w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Asana pricing</figcaption></figure><p>At first sight, it looks like Asana charges about a dollar more than Trello. However, you should also keep in mind that Asana’s free plan does come with more features compared to Trello.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Draw. Considering the number of features and capabilities that comes from the two tools for at a price that’s nearly the same, it’s hard to pick one over the other.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Keep in mind that while Asana is free to use for 15 members when you add your 16th member, you’ll be charged for all 16 members on the premium plan. Trello’s pricing is also similar.</p><p>Zepel, on the other hand, is free forever for the first 5 members. When you add your 6th member, you’ll be charged only for the 6th member and not for the first five.</p><hr><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Collaboration in both Trello and Asana are pretty straightforward. Both tools have the usual collaboration-focussed features like descriptions, assignees, due dates, tags, comments, and file attachments.</p><p>Trello allows you to collaborate with an unlimited number of users even if you’re on the free plan. This, of course, is a huge bonus for small teams who might not need a lot of features.</p><p>Asana limits you to 15 members on the free plan even if you don’t want to use their premium features. Unlike Trello which allows you to <strong>upload up to 250MB per file</strong> (at least if you upgrade), <strong>Asana only allows a maximum limit of 100MB per file</strong> even on a higher paid plan.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Trello is a clear winner over Asana thanks to them allowing an unlimited number of collaborators even on the free plan.</p><hr><h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2><p>Among all collaboration specific features, dependencies have to be one of the most important ones in a project management tool.</p><p>Trello, unfortunately, doesn’t have capabilities that allow you to mark dependencies between cards. This is where Asana beats Trello.</p><p>Asana lets you add dependencies between tasks and view them on a timeline (Gantt). This timeline view is especially useful when you want to manage conflicts between dependencies.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png" alt="Trello vs Asana: Dependencies in Asana" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png 1300w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dependencies in Asana</figcaption></figure><p>However, you must keep in mind that unlike Zepel, <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/working-with-teams/dependencies/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">dependencies</a> in Asana is not available in the free plan. Asana users can use dependencies only if they subscribe to a premium or higher paid plans.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Comparing Asana vs Trello, the clear winner when it comes to managing dependencies is Asana.</p><hr><h2 id="user-experience-and-ease-of-use">User experience and ease of use</h2><p>Both Trello and Asana have invested a great deal into building software that’s easy to use and has a great user experience.</p><p>Trello, as you might already know, is known for its ease of use.

<h2><strong>FreeBSD Jails are a well-known feature and have become core to many excellent tools on FreeBSD such as the Poudriere package builder. Jails offer process and file system isolation, but for a long time they did not offer very satisfying network isolation. VIMAGE provides isolation for networking through virtual network stacks or VNET.</strong></h2>



<p>VIMAGE was first presented in the Paper <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2003/zec-vimage/">“Implementing a Clonable Network Stack in the FreeBSD Kernel” by Macro Zec in 2003</a> and VIMAGE code appeared first in FreeBSD 8.0, however it wasn’t until FreeBSD 12.0 that VIMAGE was built into FreeBSD GENERIC kernels and it is a bit of an overlooked feature.</p>



<p>If you have used jails before you might wonder what more VNET jails offer or why you would want to migrate from using localhost-based networking. VNET jails give each jail its own isolated copy of the network stack. They get everything from the IP layer up, creating a network stack that is entirely its own, almost anything you could do with a distinct host you can do with a jail and VNET.</p>



<p>VNET network stacks can be given interfaces from the host and once an interface has been delegated into a VNET jail it disappears from the view of the host, becoming only visible in the jail. FreeBSD offers the epair interface that acts as a virtual Ethernet cable. Give one end of an epair to a VNET jail and keep the other end in the host and you have a way to network between the host and the jail or even between multiple jails. Unlike normal jail networking a VNET jail is able to fully use the interface and once given the correct permissions it can perform packet captures and traces as if it were a full host.</p>



<p>VNET allows jails to be closer to full virtual machines with much less overhead and they offer the ability to test networking in isolation with a very similar environment to the jail host.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET with a jail</strong></h4>



<p>The best way to experiment with VNET is to create some test jails and play with their networks. With VNET it is easy and cheap to create a new separate network that will not interfere with the hosts configuration.</p>



<p>First to demonstrate the power the VNET provides we will create a simple jail that only isolates networking from the host. If we run the following three commands on a FreeBSD system we can create a simple jail:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=emptyjail persist vnet
    host # jexec emptyjail /bin/sh
    emptyjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
    options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
    groups: lo
    nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>The important flags to the jail command here are <em>persist</em> and <em>vnet</em>, <em>persist</em> keeps the jail around even though nothing is running inside of it, <em>vnet</em> creates the jail with its own VIMAGE network stack.</p>



<p>The jail we have created contains a loop back interface (lo0) but cannot see any of the interfaces from the host, it has been isolated at the network and process level. Because we do not specify a new root to use for the jails file system, it can see everything on the host file system as before, this can be really handy when you are developing and running tests that take advantage of VNET.</p>



<p>For our jail to be useful we need to be able to access network interfaces, VNET jails can be given any interface and once given to a jail they vanish from the view of the host network stack. When we want to network between the host and the jail we can use an epair(4) device. epair devices are a pair of Ethernet-like interfaces connected back to back, sort of like an emulated patch cable. Each side is denoted with a letter, they come as an ‘a’ and a ‘b’ part. If we create an epair and move one half into the jail, once it is configured we can communicate from the host to the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # ja    host # ifconfig epair create
    epair0a
    host # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
            options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
            inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128
            inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x2
            inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
            groups: lo
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0a: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0a
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>This time when we create our jail we delegate one half of the epair to it. We need to configure the interface in the jail and on the host. Once we have the interfaces configured we can communicate between the host and jail (Note: when you delegate an interface to a jail all the configuration will be erased. You must configure the interface once it is inside the jail).</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=networkjail persist vnet vnet.interface=epair0b 
    host # jexec networkjail /bin/sh

    networkjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
            options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
            groups: lo
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    networkjail # ifconfig epair0b inet 192.0.2.2/24 up     
    networkjail # exit

    host # ifconfig epair0a inet 192.0.2.1/24 up
    host # ping 192.0.2.2
    PING 192.0.2.2 (192.0.2.2): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 192.0.2.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.143 ms

    round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.069/0.106/0.143/0.037 ms
</code></pre>



<p>Python3 is installed on the host and as our jail doesn’t isolate the file system, all installed software is also available to the jail. We can use the http server built in to python3 to demonstrate a simple network service running inside the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # jexec networkjail sh -c "cd /usr/src; python3 -m http.server" 
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
</code></pre>



<p>With this a web browser on the host machine can be pointed at 192.0.2.2:8000 and we can browse around the structure of the FreeBSD source tree that lives in /usr/src. We can run any service that will run on a FreeBSD host from within this VNET jail. The difference here between older jail networking is that we can do anything with the epair that we could do with a real network interface such as place add it to a bridge.</p>



<p>When we remove networkjail the half of the epair that was delegated is returned to the host:</p>



<pre><code>    host # ifconfig epair0b
    ifconfig: interface epair0b does not exist
    host # jls -v
       JID  Hostname                      Path
            Name                          State
            CPUSetID
            IP Address(es)
         1                                /
            networkjail                   ACTIVE
            3
    host # jail -r networkjail
    host # ifconfig epair0b
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>When we destroy either half of the epair both halves will be removed from the system, even if the side delegated to a jail.</p>



<p>VNET offers a facility for local testing with a network segment that is very similar to a real network. It is possible to perform any action from the host as you would on a non-virtual network interface such as adding it to a bridge or firewalling.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET to isolate networks</strong></h4>



<p>We are not limited to using virtual interfaces when using VNET, but are able to delegate any interface on the host into the VNET. VNET opens up the opportunity to isolate out chunks of networks allowing us to build complex topologies such as soft routers and firewalls.</p>



<p>We can also use the isolation offered by VNET to offer services from a host on a particular interface that might be undesirable or destructive or if the address space that a piece of equipment uses clashes with the network that the host is on.</p>



<p>On this development machine we have network interfaces on two different networks, one is in the development environment and the other lives in the sandbox testing environment. Never can packets go between the two. The sandbox testing network is where virtual machines live, normally these bhyve machines are configured with a tap interface and they join the network via a bridge interface on the host. VNET allows us to do the same thing, but with jails.</p>



<p>Before we start we need to load the kernel modules for epair and bridge on the host, they normally load automatically on the host when you try to use them, but the jail is unable to do this.</p>



<pre><code>    host # kldload if_epair if_bridge</code></pre>



<p>VNET also allows us to give a physical network interface on the development host to a jail and from that jail create further sub VNET jails that are isolated from the hosts network:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=isojail persist vnet vnet.interface=em0 children.max=1</code></pre>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After our team successfully <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/T8012#Bootrom_Exploits">ported</a> the <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit">checkm8</a> exploit to the AppleSilicon T2 chip, we began exploring methods for closed-case hardware debugging, or CCD, as found on other iDevices. On such devices, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug">Serial Wire Debug</a> protocol can be muxed out across the Lightning connector, which we presumed was replicable across the USB Type-C connector. With some assistance from easily obtainable schematics for our MacBook models, we have determined that muxing is handled by an Apple/TI co-designed <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-port-controller-interface-specification">USB Type-C Port Controller</a>, colloquially known as "ACE". The following details our findings and the vendor defined protocol, termed AppleVDM, Apple has implemented over the USB Power Delivery standard for muxing out various internal peripherals.</p><p>A member of our team, @h0m3us3r has dumped the ACE firmware by attaching a SWD probe onto exposed test points on the logic board of a MacBook Pro. Thanks to this we were able to obtain both the ROM and the firmware payload patch applied over it and discover that the ACE chip contains a <code><a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0">Cortex-M0 r0p1</a></code> ARM core. Most of the static analysis was later conducted by @mrarm.</p><pre><code>Connecting to target via SWD

<center>Segger J-Link Probe output when attached to ACE2 (CD3217).</center><h2 id="ace-overview">ACE Overview</h2><p>To better understand the inner-workings of ACE, we began looking for identifying information within the dumped firmware. We found the string <code>CD3217 &nbsp; HW0022 FW002.032.00 ZACE2-J213</code> and upon searching <code>CD3217</code> online resulted in the similar <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65986.pdf">TI TPS65986</a>. Based on how similar the functional description of the aforementioned TI USB Type-C Controller is to ACE, and considering that TI co-designed ACE with Apple, it was reasonable to assume most of the technical information applies to ACE.</p><p>TI's USB Type-C Controllers expose an I²C interface for host management, for which we found the excellent <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvuan1a/slvuan1a.pdf">Host Interface Technical Reference Manual</a>, documenting a multitude of public I²C registers and commands.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image.png 1000w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TPS65986 Functional Block Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The primary component of focus based on the above block diagram is the digital core, which communicates directly with the host and runs the firmware we dumped previously. As mentioned, the core is based on a <code>Cortex-M0 r0p1</code>. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a complete memory map with peripherals as TI does not release public information on the core itself. Regardless, we have the basic memory layout as follows:</p><p>Since we weren't sure whether the code for muxing out things lives in the ACE or somewhere else (there are registers for receiving vendor messages and processing them on another chip), we also investigated the firmware of chips that can directly communicate with the ACE, the SMC, part of T2 SoC, and the Thunderbolt controller. While we obtained and analyzed the I2C usages in the SMC firmware and found no suspicious code whatsoever, we had issues with analyzing the Thunderbolt controller firmware and decided to only reverse engineer it as a last resort. We initially thought that the only way that we could talk with the ACE from Mac OS (Intel) was by modifying the SMC firmware to relay commands to the ACE. While we have successfully managed to edit the SMC firmware and talk with the ACE, it turned out that this effort wasn't needed. Later we stumbled upon the following project: <a href="https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher">https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher</a>, which uses the AppleHPM kext in order to communicate with the ACE.</p><p>The AppleHPM KEXT allows a user space program running as root to read and write ACE registers. It also has several interesting methods that seem to be intended for reading and writing registers on ACEs connected using a USB Type-C cable to the DUT. Unfortunately, while we tried invoking them, we didn't manage to get these methods working, suggesting that either they have been disabled on production hardware or need some more preparation work in order to work. We also discovered that there exists an EFI mode firmware updater for the ACE called <code>HPMUtil.efi</code>, which we also partially reverse engineered. There seems to be several methods of updating the ACEs depending on the hardware revision; the EFI program also seems to have an argument that makes it update externally connected ACEs, however at least for recent ACEs it seems to be broken; the only update route that would work on the firmware dump we obtained from our Mac (based on available commands) seems to be hardcoded in a few places to run commands on the local ACE.</p><p>There are at least 3 known revisions of the ACE chip. Based on hardware available to us, the first variant, ACE1, is known to be used in 2018 and older T2 models, the second, ACE2, in 2019 and newer T2 models, and the third in 2020 M1 enabled laptops. The software update method differs significantly between ACE1 and ACE2. At the time of writing the article, we have only successfully dumped a single ACE firmware (ACE2) and all the analysis here is based on that version.</p><h2 id="usb-pd">USB PD</h2><p>The logical channel for telling the Mac to mux out something other than USB from the chip would be USB PD, since ACE's main communication vector with external devices is USB PD and because controlling data lines using USB PD is a widespread practice (see: MIPI debug interface as well as this article on getting UART off an Samsung phone: <a href="https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf">https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf</a>). This TI-derived controller can be configured to support some variant of MIPI debug mode by default (and the MIPI debug ID is present in the Apple ACE firmware as well), however as we discovered later it is disabled in Apple's configuration and can not be used. As such, we decided to look for other Vendor Defined Messages that the ACE understands.</p><p>In the USB PD protocol, entering a vendor mode begins by sending a SVID (Standard ID or Vendor ID, usually the vendor's USB VID) and object position (think of it as a sub mode that the vendor can define). By analyzing the ACE firmware we found at least 3 possible object positions under the Apple SVID, however their availability is dynamic and by default only a single SVID and object position is available. This primary mode is, for example, used when the Apple's charger is connected. We are not sure when the other modes are activated and plan to do further work related to figuring out what the purpose of these other modes is.</p><p>Since it would be logical if there was a reply for the command for entering a mode and also because reverse engineering an embedded firmware with no context whatsoever is hard, we decided to look into the <code>VDMs</code> command, which can be used to send a VDM PD message. This allowed us to gather important information about the firmware's inner workings and also to find a few functions that sent a message with Apple's vendor ID. We investigated several of these, some of them were indeed related to the protocol used with the charger (which we aren't sure what the purpose of is; however from what it seems it can be only used to read some memory sections from the external device), but we also found another procedure that had three cases, two of which replied with 16-bit values (created from information from a particular memory area) in a similar way to the Discover SVIDs VDM, and one of them was complex and handled additional logic. We investigated it further and eventually managed to use it to mux things out of the controller.</p><p>Another possible use of the <code>VDMs</code> command can be found in the AppleHPM KEXT and the <code>HPLUtil.efi</code> program, which is reading registers from externally connected devices. Since we haven't given much attention to it as it was not our goal and our experiments were a failure, we are not going to describe it in this article.</p><p>Note that since SWD can also be muxed from the ACE, further reverse engineering ACE modes is not that interesting; you should be able to use the ACE's SWD to trigger any mux choice of your choosing and directly talk to all peripherals ACE has access to.</p><h2 id="dive-into-the-code">Dive into the code</h2><p>With @h0m3us3r's dump of ROM and RAM memory, we started by loading the ACE firmware in IDA. The reset handler address is present at <code>0x00000004</code> and can be used to get the address of the entrypoint.</p><p>The command table can be trivially found by looking for the 4 character codes. Register table requires a bit more effort but is also not hard to find (since there is a register that is a string, you can find what references it). In comparison to the public TI documentation, there are substantially more commands and registers available, some of which are Apple-specific additions. Since the firmware has barely any strings or debug information, the command list has been very helpful.</p><p>After initially exploring the firmware we quickly stumbled upon cursed looking trampolines such as the following:</p><pre><code>ROM:000266C2 _Command_HRST                           ; DATA XREF: ROM:commandsâ†“o

<p>Pay no attention to all those nasty left-wing allegations about how military contractors collude and conspire with the Pentagon to warp our economy, impoverish our citizens, pervert our national goals, and foment needless bloody wars that slaughter millions in order to fatten corporate profits. The truth is actually much worse than you could ever imagine—as this <a href="https://www.claritypress.com/product/understanding-the-war-industry/">chilling new book</a> by Christian Sorensen makes startlingly clear.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is today one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, having been exempted from the 1998 Kyoto protocol and Paris climate change agreement (when the U.S. was abiding by it). There are also now at least 39,000 contaminated military sites across the U.S. and growing numbers of species threatened with extinction and people sickened by the toxic residues of American weapons systems.</p>



<p>In 2018, the top-five war corporations made more than $16 billion at a time when 500,000 Americans were homeless on an average every day. To sustain their obscene profits, they spend millions lobbying Capitol Hill and divvy out millions in campaign contributions to Congress. In 2012 alone, war corporations gave around $30 million and $25.5 million in 2014.</p>



<blockquote><p>Much of this money has gone to appropriation and armed services committees, which rubber stamp gargantuan military budgets that amount to more than the total of the next ten countries combined.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Rhode Island’s Jack Reed (D), characteristically took money from General Dynamics, Raytheon, Textron, Apollo Global Management (a private equity firm heavy into war industry) and large investment banks like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, and used his position to help Textron win a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-textron-bombs-idUSBRE97J0ZF20130820">U.S. contract</a>&nbsp;valued at $641 million to build 1,300 cluster bombs for Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>James Inhofe, Oklahoma’s Republican climate-change denying Senator who has headed the committee under Donald Trump, has taken donations from Boeing, General Dynamics, Honeywell, Huntington-Ingalls, and Orbital TK, along with over $338,000 in the last five years from the oil and gas industry, which profits significantly from overseas military intervention and huge military budgets that Inhofe has always championed.</p>

<p>Besides a corrupted Congress, the military-industrial complex is sustained by the revolving door of Generals who transition from high-ranking military posts to the executive boards of defense contractors where they lobby for ever higher military budgets. James Mattis characteristically went from Commander of the U.S. Central Command to a member of the board of General Dynamics, where he swore before Congress that reduced military spending was a threat to U.S. national security, to appointment in January 2017 as Secretary of Defense, where he oversaw increases in weapons sales and the U.S. war budget. Other high-ranking officials, like former CIA Director John Brennan, have found lucrative jobs peddling new wars on television or in think tanks financed by military corporations.</p>







<p>Sorensen writes that, after pumping the War on Terror for trillions in military spending, the war industry is now “returning to targeting Russia and China through ‘Great Power competition.’” This has “given the Pentagon an excuse to deploy more corporatized troops, mercenaries and goods and services right up to Russia’s borders, while Pentagon leadership has stylized such a permanent war footing as conducive to peace.”</p>



<blockquote><p>The U.S. Executive Branch has meanwhile come to take on the function of an international arms peddler.</p></blockquote>



<p>On any given day, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manages 14,000 open foreign military sales cases with 185 countries. The latter include some of the most oppressive on the planet like Israel, which systematically oppresses the Palestinians, using weapons manufactured by Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Motorola and Northrop Grumman, and Saudi Arabia, which has used hardware from General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin to pulverize Yemen.</p>



<p>From May 2015 through March 2016, American war corporations sold over $30 billion worth of goods and services also to anti-democratic Gulf allies such as the United Arab Emirates, which waged the dirty war in Yemen by proxy and was known for the brutal suppression of dissenting groups. In the Southern Hemisphere, U.S. military and corporate action yielded devastating costs in countries like Honduras and Colombia, where aerial defoliation programs have poisoned the landscape and paramilitary death squads have terrorized trade union activists and supporters of the left-wing Fuerzas Armada Revolucionario de Colombia (FARC) whose principal platform is to redistribute land and wealth.</p>

<p>By law, the U.S. is not allowed to sell weapons to regimes that come to power through coup d’états. However, the war industry successfully lobbied the government not to recognize blatant coups, like that in Egypt in 2013 and Ukraine in 2014. The war industry at the same time does everything in its power to sustain conflicts like in the Koreas, where it profits from an endless military standoff.</p>

<p>It is also in the process of provoking new ones through the Asia Pivot policy that has resulted in the military encirclement of China, promotion of NATO expansion towards Russia’s borders, and deployment of missile technology in Poland and Romania aimed directly at Russia. The inauguration of a $1.74 trillion nuclear modernization effort could ultimately lead humanity down the road to apocalypse.</p>



<blockquote><p>One of Sorensen’s contributions is to show how the war industry sustains a progressive veneer by stressing its “green initiatives” and the diversity of its workforce.</p></blockquote>



<p>John Brennan’s tenure as CIA Director from 2013 to 2017 was marked by his extending new opportunities for African Americans, and many CEOs are now women, like Marilyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin who was voted as “Forbes” most powerful woman in business for three years in a row. Hewson’s feminism, however, does not go very far if we consider her praise for the Saudi regime, which systematically persecutes women, or support for wars which kill women and children, and destroy families.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Pentagon—which Sorensen rightfully calls the “War Department”—failed an audit of more than 2.7 trillion dollars in assets. The accounting firms carrying out the audit concluded that the Pentagon’s financial records were “riddled with so many bookkeeping deficiencies, irregularities and errors that a reliable audit was simply impossible.”</p>



<p>Franklin “Chuck” Spinney, a former Pentagon employee, pointed out a pertinent accounting trick where the Pentagon routinely overestimates inflation rates for weapons systems and does not return the excess funds to the Treasury when actual inflation rates turn out to be lower. Tricks like this result in surplus slush funds which are used to fund shady covert military operations in places like sub-Saharan Africa, whose mineral wealth multi-national corporations covet.</p>



<p>The Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos (1891-1965) once stated that “we live in an era of the scientific savage, where all the wisdom of science, mathematics and physics are used for the purpose of assassination.” These remarks were made before the popularization of the drone, one of the war industry’s favorite products, which has been used to kill at least 8,000 people.</p>

<p>A good first step toward challenging the power of the war industry would be a program of peace education that would create a broader awareness of its harmful activities among the U.S. electorate. Unfortunately, the American educational system has been corrupted and conditions kids from a young age to go along with the status quo. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests forced the removal of military-related research from major universities, but such research returned with a vengeance starting with the budgetary cutbacks of the 1980s and then as part of the War on Terror. Professors now compete with one another for grants that …</p></div></div>

<p>Sometimes secondhand books can come into our possession in ways that make it quite clear they need us to read them.</p>
<p>Such was the case with&nbsp;<em>Le fascisme italien</em>&nbsp;by Pierre Milza and Serge Berstein, (1) which reached me by means of a random sequence of events including a friend moving flat, an unexpected traffic jam and a small public park on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
<p>It did not disappoint and, as I am about to explain in more detail, helped me to see a number of crucial issues more clearly.</p>
<p>Firstly, it confirmed that, despite constant claims to the contrary, fascism was not at all anti-capitalist, but extremely pro-capitalist.</p>
<p>Secondly, it presented interesting parallels with the Coronavirus-linked totalitarian mindset so dominant in 2020, which I am calling ‘newnormalism’.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it sparked some wider reflection on my part about the participation of most of the left in this 21st century authoritarianism and how that relates to my own anti-fascist position.</p>
<p><strong>FASCISM AND CAPITALISM</strong></p>
<p>It is well known, I think, that Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator, began his political career on the left and, when he started building a movement immediately after the First World War, the initial programme that attracted support was left-wing, with anarchist influences.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Milza-and-Berstein-543x900.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="552"></figure>
</div>
<p>However, as Milza and Berstein make abundantly clear, this prototype fascism was quickly and drastically ditched as Mussolini realised the only way he was going to gain the power he craved was with the support of capitalists and big landowners.</p>
<p>Much much later, at the end of the Second World War, in a desperate last-ditch attempt to rally the Italian people behind them in the face of defeat, the hardcore fascist Saló republic rediscovered their socialist side, but it was all hopelessly too late.</p>
<p>Having lived through the fascist&nbsp;<em>ventennio</em>&nbsp;(20 years), the population were not going to fall for any more redwashing attempts or superficial anti-bourgeois posturing. They had seen clearly that fascism in power defended the interests of Capital, rather than the people.</p>
<p>The authors trace this story back to 1910, when the Italian Nationalist Association was founded with “the support of certain business circles, in particular that of heavy industry”, (2) who had a very obvious direct vestes interest in promoting the nationalist call for Italian participation in the approaching war in Europe.</p>
<p>It was Mussolini’s sudden support for Italy going to war (on the Allied side), that led to him being thrown out of the socialist party, the PSI, splitting from others on the left. This left him ideally placed to benefit from capitalist funding, though it is not clear whether his conversion to the war cause was actually motivated by this consideration.</p>
<p>It is known that Mussolini received money from the French government and from pro-war businessmen like Filippo Naldi.</p>
<p>The first fascist general assembly in 1919 took place in a hall in Milan lent by a group of wealthy capitalists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascism benefited greatly from the ruling classes’ fear of a Bolshevik-style revolution in Italy, with post-war waves of strikes and a rural movement which reclaimed land from rich property owners.</p>
<p>Explain the authors: “The fear born in the world of the country landowners as a result of the land occupation movement greatly outlived the phenomenon itself and helped pushed them into the arms of fascism, through fear of a challenge to property rights”. (3)</p>
<p>Business organisations such as&nbsp;<em>Confagricoltura</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Confindustria</em>&nbsp;were set up to defend capitalism. Fascism was happy to win favour by providing them with foot soldiers, squadristi, who physically attacked trade unionists and leftists in a wave of “preventative counter-revolution”. (4)</p>
<p>This, say Milza and Berstein, represented fascism’s big break and funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fascists started receiving the support of local authorities, the army and the police in their fight against leftist ‘subversion’. They were the system’s emergency weapon against the threat of revolution.</p>
<p>“Prefects, magistrates and officers of the Carabinieri, let the fascists carry on and assure them of impunity. The moment that the State started to crumble, the bourgeoisie, so frightened by the popular uprising of 1919-20, lent their support to fascism’s reactionary violence”. (5)</p>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/squadristi.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Fascist squadristi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In November 1920, for instance, violent fascist squads descended on Bologna, where the radical left had gained control of the local council. There were nine deaths and more than 100 injuries.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the next couple of years, they smashed up trade union and co-operative HQs and attacked working-class districts, wielding clubs and revolvers to force strikers back to work.</p>
<p>By now the fascists had stopped pretending to be left-wing and were openly singing the praises of capitalism and economic liberalism. (6)</p>
<blockquote><p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Mussolini himself set before the future party a manfesto which no longer owed anything to the leftist tendencies of 1919. In the economic realm it was absolute liberalism, with the State indulging in no intervention or nationalisation, or any fiscal measures deemed ‘populist’. On the political and social side, a strong State was to be created, capable of imposing the ban on strikes in the public sector”. (7)</p>
<p>This was authoritarian capitalism, meant to please “the big money interests from whom Mussolini was now seeking political and financial backing”. (8)</p>
<p>As the future dictator said himself: “We are liberal economically, but we will never be so politically”. (9) This was a question of sacrificing political liberalism in the interests of economic liberalism, aka capitalism. (10) (<em>For more on the little-appreciated similarities between fascism and liberalism, see&nbsp;<a href="https://orgrad.wordpress.com/articles/liberalism-the-two-faced-tyranny-of-wealth/">this article</a>&nbsp;on the orgrad website</em>)</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/mussolini-rally2.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="359"></figure>
<p>Once the fascists were in power, the clamp-down on opposition was ruthless. Strikes were banned and workers found themselves defenceless against their bosses.</p>
<p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class. When finance minister Alberto De Stefani reformed the tax system in 1923 this “was above all to the profit of the rich”. (11)</p>
<p>He offered tax breaks for foreign investors, did away with the “red tape” of bodies controlling food prices and rents, ended state funding for co-operatives and halted land reforms which threatened the interests of rich landowners.</p>
<p>After 1925, in the face of economic crisis, the pure economic liberalism of the Manchester School went out of the window, in favour of state intervention.</p>
<p>But this was intervention in the interests of business and Capital, not in the interests of the Italian people whom fascism mendaciously claimed to represent!</p>
<p>‘Development’ was at the forefront of fascist plans, as is the case with all industrial capitalists. More land was cultivated and an infrastructure of roads, new towns and industrial estates was built.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Turin-Milan-autostrada.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>“A vast programme of public works was undertaken, carried out by private firms, who were offered lucrative contracts by the State. Electrification of the rail system began, with the construction of tunnels on the Rome-Naples and Bologna-Florence lines. A massive roadbuilding programme was entrusted to ANAS (Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade), created in 1928, which oversaw the showcase construction of big toll motorways, the first in Europe”. (12)</p>
<p>This was nothing other than a bailing-out of the capitalist economy by the pro-business fascist state, for which the cost would ultimately have to be borne by the public.</p>
<p>Ring any bells in 2020?</p>
<p>Banks were also treated to fascist largesse, notably BCI, saved by the Italian state with a massive influx of money.</p>
<p>Note the authors: “There was neither socialisation nor nationalisation. The State became capitalist; it guaranteed the property of most of the shareholders and their future dividends. The only socialisation was that of the losses, assumed by the public purse”. (13)</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Istituto-Mobiliare-Italiano.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>In 1931, Mussolini even set up a body,&nbsp;<em>L’Istituto mobiliare italiano</em>, with the role of helping businesses in financial trouble, declaring that this was “a means of energetically driving the Italian economy towards its corporative phase, which is to say a system which fundamentally respects private property and initiative, but ties them tightly to the State, which alone can protect, control and nourish them”. (14)</p>
<p>But the emphasis was very much on the big businesses and financiers allied with the fascist regime. Economic crisis saw numerous small and medium-sized firms go to the wall or gobbled up by big companies, as the fascist state aided this concentration of wealth into ever-fewer hands. (15)</p>
<p>“As for the working classes,” add Milza and Berstein, “they paid the price for this alliance, with unemployment, reduced wages and higher cost of living”. (16)</p>
<p>Fascist corporatism, with its officially-approved phoney trade unions, was supposed to bring together workers and bosses in the interests of the nation, but did nothing of the sort: “It allowed big industry and financial groups to use the State’s arbitration and power of coercion to reinforce their positions and impose their law on their employees”. (17)</p>
<p>“Far from being destroyed by fascism as the first proto-fascist manifesto suggested, Italian capitalism found in it a defender which managed to save it from revolution or collapse and went on to reinforce its structures and its means of action”. (18)</p>
<p>It was not for nothing that the bankers of J.P. Morgan boosted the fascist regime with a $100m loan between 1925 and 1927 (19) or that Winston Churchill praised, during a 1927 visit, Mussolini’s success in defending Italy from what he termed international subversion. He meant the radical left. (20)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>So I've been using the Github flow for some years now from both the maintainer side and contributor side to open source projects. I've also been using the email workflow for git from both sides for about a year now. Using email for git sounded quite horrible before I actually started using it. Now I prefer it so I thought I would document my experience here.</p><h2 id="the-github-flow">The Github flow</h2><p>This isn't strictly for Github, it's the flow many developers are accustomed to:</p><ol><li>Fork the project repo</li><li>Make a change on your fork</li><li>Create a pull request from a branch on your fork to the main repository</li><li>Get comments on the pull request</li><li>Force-push to the same branch to update the state of the pull request</li><li>Somebody clicks merge</li></ol><p>Basically the same flow is also used on Gitlab and the other smaller git hosting services. This flow works reasonably well. It gets slightly more annoying after the first pull request because you actually have to keep your own local branch up to date.</p><p>In theory this also gives some nice discoverability of people working on the project by looking at the forks of the project. In practice this is a bunch of outdated copies of the project by people who have mistaken the fork button for a like button.</p><p>From a maintainer point of view this flow also works alright, unless your project starts to grow. For example when postmarketOS was still on Github we ran into the issue that the merge button isn't really useful. Once you have a reasonable volume of &nbsp;pull requests the branches of those pull requests get outdated quickly meaning they have to be rebased before merging or every change will have an extra merge commit in the history. </p><p>In the postmarketOS case it was decided that merge commits are extra noise in the git history we'd like to avoid so we'd need to rebase things, and to properly rebase we have to do it from the command line because Github can't deal at all with conflicts. Rebasing from the command line also gives a lot more flexibility with squashing and having a nice commit message. </p><p>The only reason that merge button was used on Github was because Github can't seem to mark the pull request as merged if it isn't done by the button. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image.png"><figcaption>The all-knowing button from Github</figcaption></figure><p>The old workflow documentation postmarketOS had when Github was used can be read in the wiki history: <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441">https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441</a></p><p>Now we've moved to Gitlab we're basically dealing with the same issue, we have to mess with the commits before merging so we're always force-pushing to the git fork of the author of the pull request (which they have to enable on the merge request, if they don't we first have to tell them to enable that checkbox) and then finally merge them with the button in the web UI so Gitlab doesn't lose track of what happened.</p><h2 id="the-git-send-email-flow">The git-send-email flow</h2><p>The flow for pull requests in github isn't the original way to make pull requests. Since git was originally written for the development of the Linux kernel it has been designed with the workflow of the kernel in mind. The kernel uses mailing lists.</p><p>[insert image of horrified developers here]</p><p>The first patch I emailed was with the assistence of <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">https://git-send-email.io/</a>, I needed to learn how to use the email flow because at the time I was working on my very first kernel patch. This was quite a daunting task involing triple-checking everything against the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html">patch submission documentation</a> for Linux which describes the easy 16 step process.</p><p>Then after the final step the email gets sent out and you wait... for response emails.</p><p>Since then I've made contributions to projects hosted on Sourcehut, which also uses the email workflow, and now I also maintain some projects on this platform. For example <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/megapixels">Megapixels</a>.</p><p>This is the workflow for submitting a patch to a project using the email flow:</p><ol><li>Clone the repository locally</li><li>Make your changes on your local checkout</li><li>Run <code>git send-email</code> with a ref pointing to one or a range of commits</li><li>Get comments as response to the patch as emails, mirrored on the webpage of the mailing list</li><li>Fix up your previous mistakes, run <code>git send-email</code> again with the <code>-v2</code> argument to send an updated version</li><li>The maintainer applies the patch from the email.</li></ol><p>As a maintainer getting the patches like this is quite nice since unless there's a conflict you don't have to merge branches or rebase things, the patches is just ... a patch, it only has the changes from the author, not the full git history.</p><p>Also, one thing to note about the process above is that, except for receiving the feedback, it will never touch your mail client. Git does SMTP itself and make sure the emails you send out are up-to-spec so maintainers can apply the changes directly by feeding the email into <code>git am</code></p><p>If your main complaint is that email is horrible to work with, the issue is most likely not email, it's probably your mail client.</p><p>One of the other main issues with the email workflow is that you can't just see the full state of the "pull request" because there's no nice pull request page to see what's happening. This is one of the main reasons I like the mailing lists on Sourcehut, the patch view fixes most of the visibility issues, for example this simple patch: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382">https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382</a></p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png"><figcaption>The overview of a patch submitted to a Sourcehut mailing list</figcaption></figure><p>There you see the patch description in the first block, which is in this case didn't have any extra text added in the <code>git send-email</code> stage, so it only shows a summary of the changes in this patch.</p><p>Below that is the actual patch, with the subject of the patch as header and then showing the full commit message below that if there were more lines and then the full diff. This patch can also be exported directly as a .patch file using the link right of the subject.</p><p>Finally, below the diff is a comment from Eyal who applied this patch to the development branch and thanked the author; the mailing list will generate a nice threaded view here if there's more discussion.</p><p>The block on the right will show the status of the patch, <code>APPLIED</code> in this case and gives some extra tools to get a copy of the full patchset that can be applied using <code>git am</code></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I personally prefer the e-mail workflow now, it saves me from keeping branches/forks up to date as with this workflow only diffs are sent around. Also after working in Gitlab for most of the things I do on postmarketOS I really like how quickly sourcehut pages load and that I just can get all info from the patch without clicking on tabs to switch between comments, diffs and commit messages with loading times in between.</p><p>Also one nice improvement is that instead of doing half the maintainer flow in the browser by clicking things and half by patching stuff up in my local git branch and force pushing that, it just lets me do everything in the shell and then just send an email back telling the author their patch got merged.</p><p>All together people are most likely already used to having all the comments and info emailed to them as notifications, it's just that in the gitlab/hub case it will send you a link to continue on their website and in the sourcehut/email flow case the email is everything you need to continue without ever opening the browser.</p>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On December 28th, President Donald Trump signed into law an omnibus spending bill allocating $1.4 trillion in federal funding for the 2021 fiscal year. Covering everything from pandemic-relief provisions to defense spending, the massive bill also contains the FY 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act, which codifies U.S. covert and clandestine operations and defines requirements for reporting to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since it was first presented by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee in June, this year’s Intelligence Authorization Act has been of unusual interest thanks to an included provision titled “Advanced Aerial Threats.” In this inclusion, the committee offered intriguing support for the “efforts of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence” and requested the production of an unclassified report detailing the analysis of UFOs, or as The Pentagon now terms them, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or “Anomalous Aerial Vehicles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the recent passing of the Omnibus, seemingly the clock is ticking and The Pentagon’s UAP Task Force now has 180 days to provide the Senate Intelligence Committee with their unclassified report detailing The Pentagon’s current investigations into UFOs. However, easily overlooked, the provision is not law and there is still no guarantee that a comprehensive, “all-source” UAP report will end up seeing the light of day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_97675" width="1170" height="878" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="878" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Md7zIXWiTw?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The newly enacted Intelligence Authorization Act incorporates the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report language calling for an unclassified, all-source report on the UAP phenomenon. This was accomplished in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the bill,” says Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and former staff Director of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee, who played an integral role in the development of the legislation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Consequently, it’s now fair to say that the request for an unclassified report on the UAP phenomenon enjoys the support of both parties in both Houses of Congress,” Mellon told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email. “Assuming the Executive Branch honors this important request, the nation will at long last have an objective basis for assessing the validity of the issue and its national security implications. This is an extraordinary and long overdue opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Origins for the Senate Intelligence Committee’s UAP report request can be traced back to December 2017, when the&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New York Times&nbsp;</span></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">published an article</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;revealing a secretive study within the Pentagon known as The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). Coinciding with the article’s publication were the “unofficial” release of three videos captured by the Navy in 2004 and 2015, which showed indistinctive airborne objects claimed to be UAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April 2020, the Department of Defense officially released the three videos, acknowledging in a statement from the Secretary of Defense’s Office that aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as “unidentified.” In mid-August, the Pentagon formally acknowledged they had established a task force looking into UAP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_18040" width="1170" height="658" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHunx8BocSI?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a press announcement, the Secretary of Defense’s Office stated, “the UAPTF’s mission will be to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” According to the release,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/the-dod-has-officially-announced-it-has-a-uap-task-force-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">authority for the Task Force was approved</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by the DoD’s chief operating officer, Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most vocal advocates for a serious investigation into UFO sightings in recent months has been Luis Elizondo, the former Director of the National Programs Special Management Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, who headed up the Pentagon’s AATIP program. In the fall of 2017, Elizondo resigned from the DoD, citing what he felt was a lack of serious attention being placed on the UAP issue. Elizondo would subsequently go to work for the To the Stars Academy, a UFO-centric organization founded by musician Tom DeLonge.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I believe this is a tremendous step forward in that our representatives are taking this topic seriously,” Elizondo told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email, speaking about the approval of the recent Intelligence Authorization Act.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While this news may be exciting for many UFO/UAP enthusiasts, the UAP report provision is not binding law, so there is no guarantee the public will be provided any comprehensive information on UAP. Additionally, if the <a href="https://thedebrief.org/fast-movers-and-transmedium-vehicles-the-pentagons-uap-task-force/">UAP Task Force deems certain information classified</a>, the legislative branch does not have the authority to declassify that information in order to make it publicly available. With a new executive administration taking office in less than a month, it may ultimately come down to the significance the Biden administration, and new presidential appointees place on the UAP issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We must remain diligent in order to ensure any report submitted to Congress is done to the level and expectations of the committee members,” Elizondo said, “and not simply a whitewash to satisfy yet another Congressional requirement.”</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-12190" data-id="12190"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Christopher Mellon remains cautious but optimistic. “The challenge now will be getting the myriad DoD and I.C.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’m hopeful the new Administration will rigorously execute its oversight prerogatives because the concerns of the public and numerous U.S. military personnel have been ignored by a complacent national security bureaucracy for far too long,” Mellon said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As 2021 approaches, <a href="https://thedebrief.org/leaked-photo-surfaces-of-purported-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-leaked-ufo-photo/">the UAP issue is more visible than ever.</a> Despite this, the level of accessibility of information included with the Task Force’s forthcoming report remains to be determined.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This report, when submitted, will serve as a litmus to determine how seriously the Pentagon takes this topic,” Elizondo said, “and even more so, the authority and the will of the Congress.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Let me remind the Pentagon,” Elizondo added, “that the world is watching and will judge them on their actions.”</span></p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="https://paperless.blog/2009/12/25/vcard-parser-and-validator/">vCard 3.0 validator</a> is ten years old. The standard has moved on, Python has moved on, and I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two as a developer. But I'm not working on any vCard validators, and probably won't be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second-system syndrome</a>, but I've tried to reboot the project at least three times now. The Python code isn't very elegant, fast or well tested. I set up skeletons in <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard/tree/master/javcard">Java version</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard-rust">Rust</a>, both excellent languages. I tried defining an <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4">ANTLR grammar</a>. But I've got nothing to show for any of that. The main problem is motivation: vCard 3, 4 and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a> are incredibly out of date, to the point where writing a parser is equal parts painful and boring.</p>
<p><img src="https://paperless.blog/assets/images/standards.png" alt="standards" width="500" height="283"></p>
<p>And now, because the Internet needs more opinions (and standards): a human friendly address card format is possible. vCard/jCard is not it. When someone brave and tenacious enough to take this on comes around, I really hope they take at least the following into account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use a <strong>popular, existing serialization format.</strong> JSON won in this space. It's not perfect, but it's here to stay and it's a good compromise between human and machine readable.</li>
    <li>Don't create another jCard. If you were developing the world's first address card format, what would users and developers want to see?</li>
    <li>Conversely, vCard did many things right. <strong>UTF-8, base64 and ISO dates</strong> are definitely good things.</li>
    <li>All caps is hard to read. Don't shout.</li>
    <li>Don't limit (or even recommend) a line length or line splitting scheme. Address cards shouldn't be inlined into emails or documents any more than CSV files.</li>
    <li><strong>Dictionaries</strong> (as in associated key/value pairs) are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Lists</strong> are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferred name</strong> should probably be the only required name field.</li>
    <li><strong>Time zones are not UTC offsets.</strong> I do not live in time zone "+12:00", because that offset changes twice per year. I live in time zone "Pacific/Auckland". This can be the difference between being on time and wasting everybody's time.</li>
    <li>Allow <strong>linking to photos.</strong> Sure URLs are ephemeral, but so is basically everything in an address card.</li>
    <li><strong>Any property not in the standard should simply be ignored,</strong> as long as the entire document is still a valid instance of the serialization format.</li>
    <li><strong>Internationalization and localization</strong> are complex but important.</li>
</ul>
<p>What will such a standard look like? Maybe something like this will be possible:</p>
<pre>{
    "preferred name": "Jane Doe",
    "phone": {
        "cell": ["+99 9999-9999", "+11 0000 0000"],
        "home": "+99 9999-9999"
    },
    "URL": {
        "blog": "https://…",
        "work": ["https://example.org/", "https://example.com/"]
    },
    "photo": "https://…",
    "my custom property": "…",
    "time zone": "Pacific/Auckland"
}
</pre>
