<p>This story is a bit long, but I promise it will be worth it, because it contains the two most important principles every designer must know and take to heart if you intend to do great work anywhere, under almost any circumstances, over the long, long haul of your career.</p>



<h2>The Bronze Age of me</h2>



<p>Early in my career, before the web, when I was in advertising, I had the good fortune to work for legendary creative directors. They’d amassed so many awards in their careers that, in the event of Apocalypse, they could have melted their shiny trophies down and lived off the barter value of the metal.</p>



<p>These old men were giants who had once strode the halls of famous agencies, but ours was not famous—at least not for being good. It was a reeking quagmire where great ideas went to die.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our company knew it had a problem, so it kept hiring brilliant creative leaders, paying them to inspire us demoralized and underpaid young art directors and copywriters, and pitting us against an internal culture that had been designed quite carefully to neutralize and kill the kind of work our ever-changing cast of overlords challenged us to create.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Let me unpack that.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Our clients were makers of aspirin and ointments. They owned financially successful chain restaurants. If it ached, if it bled, if it could be satisfied with heaping plates of deeply fried or sauce-drowned food-like products at a family-friendly low price, we probably handled its advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of advertising, painstakingly crafted to offend no one, and baited with jingles that stick, unwanted, in the mind, works chiefly by being shown so many times that it can’t help but lodge in the collective consciousness and inexorably drive sales. Think McDonald’s, but smaller and less … glamorous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saturation is the name of the game, and the agency (like others of its kind) made its money by taking a commission on media placement.&nbsp;<em>Creative was something we gave away free.</em> All we wanted was a cut of the fee broadcasters charged to run the stuff.</p>



<h2>Fear of a creative planet</h2>



<p>A great ad—one people talked about, one that potentially risked offending a few people—would destroy the cozy and lucrative business relationships on which the agency was founded. The company knew it, and hired skilled account executives to prevent even a moderately good idea from ever reaching the airwaves.</p>



<p><em>But…</em></p>



<p>Creative advertising was much talked-about in the popular culture of the time, and our clients asked for it even though they wouldn’t have bought it to save their children’s lives. So the agency occasionally had to show a good idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides, we young art directors and copywriters were idealists, and the agency wasn’t paying us enough to buy our loyalty. They <em>might</em> have distributed the profits more equitably, but the account executives had houses in Darien and ex-spouses to support, so they couldn’t afford to waste any of that money on the troops who did the work the whole thing ran on.</p>



<p>Hence every six months the company hired new creative directors who, we grunts thought, would finally “turn this place around” and allow us to do the kind of work we dreamed of.</p>



<p>This is how our company came to hire legendary award winners. And although we never sold a great ad, the lesson I learned from them turned out to be the second most important guiding principle of my work as a designer. The first, most important principle, of course, is listen to the customer. But this other principle comes a close second.</p>



<p>The principle these creative directors taught me, chiefly by how they acted, was…</p>



<h2>Never give up.</h2>



<p>Never stop trying to do great work. Never get demoralized. Never stop caring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It sounds simple. It isn’t.</p>



<p>I watched these creative directors and their partners work all night to produce a great idea in spite of all the constraints around the client and product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I watched them enthusiastically present great work internally. Watched the internal folks sabotage it through fear. Watched my leaders cheerfully go back to the drawing board and come up with something new by the next morning.</p>



<p>I watched them enact this ritual a half-dozen times before the work even got shown to the clients.</p>



<p>I watched the clients shoot it down. I watched my leaders cheerfully get up, put their materials away, come back to the agency, and start over.</p>



<p>Never, not once, did they dial it in. Never did they just shrug their shoulders and say, “Fine, I’ll give these people what they want.” They listened to the customer but the customer didn’t dictate. The customer’s business problem dictated the creative solution. The solution would work if the customer bought it. If the customer didn’t buy, well, there was another great creative solution out there, if you just worked hard enough to find it.</p>



<p>Even in those extremely backwards times, there were great women creative directors out there, too—but our agency never hired one, so I only got to meet these men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were old men—one of them, who leaned forward with a hunch, and always walked as if he were in pain—looked like Moses. I swear he stared through my soul when I tried to go home before 8:00 PM. (We worked in offices then, and you never went home before your boss.) He scared me but I liked him.</p>



<div><p>Once I asked if he missed the “great” clients he had worked for in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>“Great clients?”</p><p>“Like Volkswagen.”</p></div>



<p>“They killed just as many good ads as these guys do.”</p>



<p>“What did you do?”</p>



<p>“Came up with more ads.”</p>



<p>The ability to keep coming up with more ads was why this Moses-looking dude had a roomful of shiny trophies, and I did not. If I wanted a career like his, I would have to seek deeply in my soul for the strength and willingness not to give up.</p>



<p>Career aside,<em>&nbsp;if I wanted to create meaningful work,</em>&nbsp;I would need to develop the patience and willingness to watch people kill my darlings, and come back with newer, fresher, better darlings.</p>







<p>I have not done it perfectly, not by a long shot. But keeping a positive attitude when an idea I’ve fallen in love with gets rejected remains the second most important thing I can do on a daily basis as I practice my current craft.</p>



<p>Both product work and client work are tough. The challenges can seem overwhelming. We bang our heads. We weep. Finally, we and our teammates come up with a solution. This is it! We’ve done it! Joyfully, we share it. Our lead shoots holes in it. Maybe because it runs afoul of some important learning we didn’t know about. Or because it was tried before we got here and tested badly. Or, sometimes, because they just don’t like it.</p>



<p>We come back with three ideas and none of them are quite right, either.</p>



<p>So we go back and work harder and come up with new stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The well is never dry. We only run out of ideas when we choose to stop doing the work.</p>



<p>The designers I work with here today inspire me on many levels. Their energy, their talent, their sheer skill impresses me. But what blows me away most of all, is that the really good designers stand up to the misfortune of a killed idea. They take away the lesson of what went wrong, and come back with something that much stronger. Or, if not stronger, something different but equally good.</p>



<p>Never give up.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>This article was inspired by a conversation I had with one of our designers, after watching her respond graciously and positively while working on a tough project.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Every few years there comes a technology that people get hyped about, everyone wants to be a specialist in that field because it appears to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>Between 2015-2019 this was largely about bitcoins and blockchain technology. Everyone wanted to be a specialist in blockchain technology. Bitcoin was booming, ICOs were happening to the left and right.</p>
<p>And people were trying to introduce/incorporate blockchain technology into everything they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>Yes sometimes blockchain technology can improve the existing system. However, when you try to introduce blockchain or any other technology into something that doesn’t require it,the results can be disastrous.</p>
<p>This is a story I wanted to write for a very long time, it was about a small startup called BlockEvent. A small startup that wanted to incorporate blockchain technology into event management.</p>
<p><em>Their website blockevent.tk is now not functioning, and I was unable to find a web archive snapshot. A mirror exists on a different domain, please check the footnotes.</em></p>
<p>Blockchain on event management has been there before BlockEvents. Smart ticketing and smart contracts are currently being used to improve the ticketing field and control pricing etc.</p>
<h2>BlockEvent</h2>
<p>BlockEvents wanted to make the whole event process a decentralized mechanism. From user data, to events, to registration, everything was supposed to be “decentralized” and was “not accessible” to and “not modifiable” by anyone.</p>
<p>According to the BlockEvent team, </p>
<blockquote><p>We made BlockEvent as a decentralized system. That means no central party can control this booking process and it will work without any third party involvement. </p><p>BlockEvent acts as a bridge between the organizers and the participants where organizers come and create events through our system, and participants can come and book their tickets. </p><p>The whole process is done through Public Blockchain.</p><p>… </p><p>Using the blockchain for user identity management is a whole new paradigm.</p><cite>BlockEvent on one of their Facebook posts, describing their system. </cite></blockquote>
<p>BlockEvent when initially started mainly hosted monthly blockchain event meetup events. However, their big break came in May 2019, during the annual Google I/O.</p>
<p>Google I/O event is celebrated in Sri Lanka every year, with local tech companies hosting events of their own, with local influencers, while live streaming the Google I/O event.</p>
<p>The selection process is a very completions, hundreds of people compete for few limited number of seats. These events are a good place to network and meet new friends in IT field. Plus you end up getting some cool swags.</p>
<p>In order to be selected to these events you need to show that you are a tech person, usually they check your GitHub page, blog or YouTube channel. And the tech company will select and send an invitation to whom they think are the most suitable to attend their events.</p>
<p>Until 2018, this was done by using a simple Google form or a regular website.</p>
<p>However, in 2019, one of the largest tech and telecom companies in Sri Lanka decided to use BlockEvents to host their Google I/O event.</p>
<p>Getting selected by a big company like them to manage their Google I/O event was big deal, because they host one of the largest I/O events in Sri Lanka. And BlockEvent can leverage this to opportunity to get bigger clients in future.</p>
<p>It was their make or break moment. They had to nail it, and if they failed then for a small startup like BlockEvent, the damage to their reputation is going to hurt them to a point where there is no return.</p>
<h2><strong>Disaster</strong> </h2>
<p>BlockEvent also in their description, said this,</p>
<blockquote><p>To ensure the user data privacy and security, <strong>we are not storing any user credentials or password</strong>[s] <strong>in our database. Even the user emails are stored as a hash. Only the users know their passwords </strong>and that will provide 100% control over your account actions. Even BlockEvent team can’t access your accounts. </p><cite>BlockEvent describing their system in a Facebook post</cite></blockquote>
<p>Since they were storing <strong>everything </strong>in the blockchain, they were not storing even user emails and passwords. This may sound as a good privacy focused system. But this will come to hurt BlockEvent in a very bad way.</p>
<p>Since no one else other than the people in monthly blockchain meetups knew about BlockEvents, like in any other new service, most people registering for the local Google I/O event used either throwaway passwords, or new passwords which they forgot or didn’t save.</p>
<p>This caused large number of people to forget their passwords. If we use a normal database to store user data, with no hashing, they would have been able to reset the user passwords.</p>
<p>However, since everything is stored in blockchain, and everything were hashed, this meant that there is no way to reset a user password. </p>
<p>This led to large number of people being locked out of their accounts, unable to create new accounts with the existing emails, and BlockEvent team unable to reset passwords.</p>
<p>This caused a wave of negative reviews on BlockEvent Facebook page and on social media. Some users demanded the organizers to go back to the old system of using a Google form for user registration.</p>
<p>BlockEvent finally responded to their users, they had no way to reseat the password. Unless you remember the password and login, or you are permanently locked out from using the account.</p>

<blockquote><p>Due to the rules of decentralization, we can’t reset your passwords as we are giving priority to user data and security. We already communicated this on registration [on sign up]. </p><p>To ensure the decentralization the same rule is applied by many other [b]lockchain projects and products all over the world.</p><cite>BlockEvent responding to the events on a Facebook page</cite></blockquote>
<p>BlockEvent also asked participants to send their personal details on Facebook and via a Google form, so they can manually arrange a way to send the gift pack to the participants.</p>
<p>Some of the users accused the selection process was also flawed and complained that some of the people who were less qualified to attend the event were selected over them.</p>
<p>All this led to irreplaceable damage on BlockEvent, and the Google I/O event didn’t happen due to the Easter Sunday bombings. </p>
<p>BlockEvent went into hiatus few months later, all thought they never mentioned that they are shutting down, their website went offline once their domain name expired. Possibly signaling the end of the startup that hoped to decentralize how we manage identity online.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong> </h2>
<p>The title of the post is <strong>“Somethings are never meant to be invented”</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter how utopian the idea may sound like, guaranteeing 100% user privacy with everything stored on a blockchain, not even giving access to user email to the creators can have its own drawbacks.</p>
<p>And since we are all humans, and we all tend to make mistakes, there has to be a fail safe mechanism, that will keep things in check and can undo the mistakes when we make one.</p>
<p>Also a single use password is a very bad idea, not only that users can lose their passwords, but also in the event of a data breach, user handing over the password to a third party by a mistake, how can the service reset the passwords? There are so many scenarios where things can go wrong.</p>
<p>May be an idea like BlockEvent were never meant to be invented.</p>
<p><strong>The currently hyped up technology may not be ideal for your system and instead a time tested solution may be the answer that you’re looking for.</strong></p>
<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>When it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, I’m still open minded, at the same time but skeptical. I’m not yet ready to invest or build something on blockchain.</p>
<p>I still find it difficult to fully understand the idea of blockchain, what makes it different from a decentralized git repository? Why Git is easy to implement but blockchain is hard? </p>
<p>When it comes to BlockEvents, I think what they did was store the email and password both hashed on the blockchain, and when a user logs in, they match the submitted hashed email and hashed passwords against what’s stored in the blockchain, like we do it in a normal login system using a database, except the fact that we don’t hash the emails.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p><em>I’m not a blockchain expert, so I don’t know the exact reason why BlockEvent was not able to reset the passwords.</em></p>
<p><em>Was it because they didn’t know the emails because they were hashed, or was it because once you put some information to the blockchain it is immutable, or was it due to both?</em></p>
<p><em>At the time when I saw this in 2019, I thought it was due to the fact that data is immutable on the blockchain, but now at the time of writing I feel it was due to the fact that the emails were stored on the blockchain in hashed format.</em></p>
<p><em>I also don’t know what really caused so many people to lose their password, my assumption is that they used a throwaway password, or a new password which they forgot. But still this number of users getting locked out is still unexplained.</em></p>
<p><em>After further Googling I was able to find a mirror of the original website on another domain name http://blockevent.ml</em></p>
<p><em>I tried logging in using my BlockEvent account, but I also have forgotten my BlockEvent password, and now I’m also locked out.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Law enforcement wiretapped the very service used by criminals to evade interception</p><div><p>The virtual private network (VPN) Safe-Inet used by the world’s foremost cybercriminals has been taken down yesterday in a coordinated law enforcement action led by the German Reutlingen Police Headquarters together with Europol and law enforcement agencies from around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Safe-Inet service was shut down and its infrastructure seized in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and the United States. The servers were taken down, and a splash page prepared by Europol was put up online after the domain seizures. This coordinated takedown was carried out in the framework of the <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/empact">European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Turning the table on the criminals&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Active for over a decade, Safe-Inet was being used by some of the world’s biggest cybercriminals, such as the ransomware operators responsible for ransomware, E-skimming breaches and other forms of serious cybercrime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This VPN service was sold at a high price to the criminal underworld as one of the best tools available to avoid law enforcement interception, offering up to 5 layers of anonymous VPN connections.</p>
<p>Law enforcement were able to identify some 250 companies worldwide which were being spied on by the criminals using this VPN. These companies were subsequently warned of an imminent ransomware attack against their systems, allowing them to take measures to protect themselves against such an attack.<br>
The service has now been rendered inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigations are ongoing in a number of countries to identify and take action against some of Safe-Inet’s users. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>International cyber sweep&nbsp;</h3>
<p>International police cooperation was central to the success of this investigation as the critical infrastructure was scattered across the world.</p>
<p>Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) </a>supported the investigation from the onset, bringing together all the involved countries to establish a joint strategy and to organise the intensive exchange of information and evidence needed to prepare for the final phase of the takedown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Police President of the Reutlingen Police Headquarters, Udo Vogel</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The investigation carried out by our cybercrime specialists has resulted in such a success thanks to the excellent international cooperation with partners worldwide. The results show that law enforcement authorities are equally as well connected as criminals.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, Edvardas Šileris</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &nbsp;strong working relationship fostered by Europol between the investigators involved in this case on either side of the world was central in bringing down this service. &nbsp;Criminals can run but they cannot hide from law enforcement, and we will continue working tirelessly together with our partners to outsmart them.</p>

            <!-- //category -->


            <p><a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/datafusion" title="DataFusion">DataFusion</a> is a new data processing engine written in the Rust programming language. It provides a SQL and a DataFrame API to transform datasets from multiple sources and in multiple file formats, similar to Spark. DataFusion uses <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/" title="Apache Arrow">Apache Arrow</a> as the underlying memory model, an efficient in-memory columnar format. This choice has significant performance benefits compared to a row-level representation such as used by <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" title="Apache Spark">Apache Spark</a>.</p>
<p>As other databases &amp; engines have shown, performing analytical (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing" title="OLAP">OLAP</a>) queries on a <a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2005/papers/P19.pdf" title="columnar rather than row-by-row format">columnar rather than row-by-row format</a> can significantly speed up query execution, often by 20x or more!  When processing is done row-by-row, a lot of complex operations are being executed in the inner loop when executing a query, such as interpreting an expression, computing the result and going to the next value in the row, dealing with completely different operations and data types. In contrast, when operating on a columnar level, the inner loop can be very simple, making it easy for the CPU to see what instructions will likely run next and utilize various forms of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism" title="instruction level parallelism">instruction level parallelism</a>. Modern CPUs can run hundreds of instructions at the same time, even on one core. Code can be written to use available <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD" title="SIMD">SIMD</a> instructions, operating at multiple inputs at the same time to speed up things even more.<img src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/simd.png" alt="Arrow Format" title="Arrow Format"></p>
<p><em>Image source: Arrow website</em></p>
<p>DataFusion is implemented in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" title="Rust">Rust</a>, a language that is both fast and has control over memory while still providing memory safety, making it a very suitable language to write performant and correct code. Compared to Java running on the JVM, systems written in Rust tend to use much less memory. This saves costs and makes it possible to run bigger workloads on a single machine! An earlier benchmark of <a href="https://ballistacompute.org/" title="Ballista">Ballista</a>, a distributed engine in Rust utilizing DataFusion, <a href="https://andygrove.io/rust_bigdata_benchmarks/" title="shows">shows</a> that it can do with about 10x less memory on small to medium sized datasets. The JVM needs at least 1 GB for the heap. Spark also keeps intermediate results in memory between stages. DataFusion can stream more in batches of records, keeping memory usage low. DataFusion also benefits from Arrow format, which stores data types such as strings in an efficient way.</p>
<p>Numerous performance improvements have been added in the Rust version of Arrow and DataFusion between version 2 and 3 which is planned for release in January.<br>
For example, I have contributed a<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8781" title=" faster CSV parser"> faster CSV parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8863" title="improved">improved</a> the performance of <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8832" title="hashing">hashing</a>. Kernels have been improved that provide implementations of often-used calculations, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8800" title="sum">sum</a>, filter, <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8803" title="taking multiple elements">taking multiple elements</a> of an array by index (also called indexing or gathering), and <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8837" title="more">more</a>. As DataFusion and Arrow are relatively new projects, there is still a lot of room for further improvement.</p>
<p>Recently, I <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8961" title="added a new optimization pass to">added a new optimization pass to</a> DataFusion to make hash joins faster. A hash join is a popular algorithm to implement joins in a fast way. The hash join algorithm is divided in a <em>build</em> stage and a <em>probe</em> stage. The <em>build</em> (or left side) stage creates a lookup table to map the keys in the join condition to a row index. The <em>probe</em> (right side) stage looks up the items in the lookup table by key and adds the matching rows to the end result if there is a match.<br>
It is faster to create a lookup table for the smallest table. This will avoid work for creating the lookup table for more rows, as well as not having the requirement to keep the bigger table in memory. For the optimization to be possible, we need to know the number of rows of both sources before executing the query. Luckily, for Parquet and in-memory tables this can be calculated based on the metadata. This information has been exposed recently in DataFusion.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-results">Implementation / Results</h4>
<p>The optimization is implemented as an optimization pass on the logical plan, an abstract representation of a query. When the left side of a join has more rows than the right side, the order and join type are swapped. If the left side already is smaller, the order is kept intact.<br>
While testing the optimization something unexpected happened: When the optimization rule was used to change the order, the query performed worse than the original.<br>
While studying the implementation of the hash join in DataFusion, it became clear that next to the left side of a join, the right part creates a lookup table as well!<br>
I <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8965" title="changed the implementation">changed the implementation</a> to only use the probe side to look up items on the left side and simplified the implementation, removing some other inefficiencies. Now queries having joins run much faster than before. This can be demonstrated on two <a href="http://www.tpc.org/tpch/" title="TCP-H">TCP-H</a> benchmark queries that include a join and are supported in DataFusion. Notably, TCP-H 5 is now 16x faster and TCP-H 12 more than 4 times faster.<br>
I ran the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/benchmarks" title="TPC-H">TPC-H</a> benchmarks using the command: <code>cargo run  --release --bin tpch -- benchmark --iterations 10 --path <location> --format tbl --query 12 --batch-size 20000 --concurrency 10 -m </location></code> and averaged the results.</p>
<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/improved_join-900x629.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When the optimization rule is applied and combined with the improved hash join implementation, it makes the queries where the rule can be applied run faster, in this case reducing the total execution time by about 16%. For more imbalanced joins, the speedup can be greater. The data contains roughly 6 million line items (originally on the left side of the join) and 1.5 million orders (on the right side).</p>
<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/carbon-7-900x834.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/join_build_probe_order-900x542.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Statistics are a promising way to accelerate queries. In the future, a lot more optimizations could be added that benefit from table statistics. Many statistics however are known only after queries run, so in the future it would be interesting to add a form of <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/05/29/adaptive-query-execution-speeding-up-spark-sql-at-runtime.html" title="Adaptive Query Execution">Adaptive Query Execution</a> as well.<br>
Hash joins could be further improved, for example by using <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/vectorized-hash-joiner/" title="vectorized hashing">vectorized hashing</a>, which can also be used for hash aggregations which are used in GROUP BY queries.</p>
<p>I am personally very excited for what the future of Arrow and DataFusion brings and making Rust and Apache Arrow accelerate data analytics &amp; data science.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The first hearing in the court case of German-Swiss media empire Ringier Axel Springer against Polish journalist Witold Gadowski was set to take place in the regional court of Warsaw Provincial court of Warsaw but was postponed due to security concerns after up to 100 of Gadowski's supporters showed up in court. </p><div><p>Axel Springer SE is the largest digital publishing house in Europe, controlling two of Germany's largest news brands, Bild and Die Welt. In Poland, it's the publisher of country's largest tabloid "Fakt" and one of the largest weeklies "Newsweek" as well as the largest newsportal Onet.pl.</p>

<p>The media group sued Gadowski for his statement in which he claimed that the company, founded in 1946, was from the outset linked to people from the Wehrmacht, the SS and Gestapo, while the company’s founder, Axel Springer, was himself involved with the Nazi regime”. In response, the media group Gadowski for infringement of personal interests.</p>

<p>Axel Springer, born in 1912 worked as an editor in his father's newspaper "Altonaer Nachrichter". After Hitler came to power in 1933, the paper participated in the anti-Jewish progaganda campaign directed against the German Jewish community. He was also a member of the Nazi paramilitary organization "The National Socialist Motor Corps". Another stain on his legacy was his decision to abandon his half-Jewish wife Martha Else Meyer, who just had given birth to their first child, soon after the Nurnberg laws came into force and remarrying with an "Aryan" woman.</p>

<p>Witold Gadowski told the media present for the hearing that he hopes that justice will prevail and that the proceeding will be on the grounds of the Polish law, where the constitution guarantees the Polish journalists’ freedom of speech. He also underlined that Axel Ringer Springer is trying to infringe on that exact freedom of speech by taking him to court.</p>

<p>The judge was surprised by the number of people who appeared in the court to support Gadowski and postponed the hearing due to safety concerns.</p>

<p>According to Gadowski, the case filed against him by Axel Springer could first step on the road to restoring the faith in the media in Poland. The columnist said that he still has faith and believes that facts and the truth will be enough to win the case.</p>

<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

                    <hr> 
                    <p>The web is thirty years old this month, counting from the date the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/08/history-of-the-web/origins.htm">first web server was launched on Christmas 1990</a>. Personally, August 6th, 1991, is more significant, when the web was publicly announced.</p>

<p>In 1991 I was writing for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> magazine, which was a lot of fun, because I got to work with, and write about, people who were doing fascinating things with computer technology. Working for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> led to writing the book <em>Taking the Next Step</em> and a short stint at Steve Jobs’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> as a technical writer.</p>

<p>The most innovative project I encountered that year was not NeXT. Rather, it was something developed by Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory. He used a NeXT computer to develop a networked information system for high-energy physicists. If I hadn’t been reading  the <em>comp.sys.next</em> Usenet newsgroups carefully, I would have missed the announcement of a “a hypertext editor for the NeXT.”</p>

<p>Not many people used “WWWNeXTStepEditor version 0.12.” The NeXT community was small and many NeXT computer users did not yet have Internet access, which was required to access Tim Berners-Lee’s experimental “WorldWideWeb” documents. To me, the name WorldWideWeb seemed a bit of a conceit since the only users at the time were high-energy physicists at a few research institutes.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, as soon I’d installed and tried the software, I wanted to get involved. I told everyone about it, including a fellow editor at <em>NeXTWORLD,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>. Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, and cofounder of the (then-new) Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor">Mitch Kapor</a>…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-barlow.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you don’t recognize Barlow’s references, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Project Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a> was a visionary hypertext project that predated the Internet. The Matrix is not the movie universe created by the Wachowskis but, rather the network of computer networks that existed before the commercialization of the Internet (as described by the researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quarterman">John Quarterman</a>).</p>

<p>Subsequently I joined the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0001.html">www-talk mailing list</a> and also contacted Tim Berners-Lee directly. I wanted to know if he was interesting in technology I’d heard about from friends at Adobe Systems. Adobe’s editable PostScript specification (which came to be named PDF and became the basis for a product named “Acrobat”) seemed to me a better match for distributed hypertext than the very-limited SGML-based “HTML tags” that Tim Berners-Lee was using. HTML offered only minimal layout and styling possibilities; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> was a better page description language.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-timbl.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee was reluctant to publicize that code for the web was available for free, as management at CERN had not yet agreed to release it publicly (that didn’t happen until <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399">April 1993</a>), and I wasn’t able to write about it for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> (too bad, as I could have been the first journalist to write about the web!).</p>

<p>Subsequently, editable PostScript was released, and in 1993, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> of CERN visited me in California. I arranged a meeting between Cailliau and management at Adobe Systems. He met with John Kunze of Adobe at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and demonstrated the World Wide Web — the first time management at Adobe had seen the Web. By that time, HTML was firmly entrenched as the native language of the new Web. Adobe later invested in Netscape Communications and produced an Acrobat plug-in for the Netscape Web browser, establishing the basis for viewing richly formatted PDF pages in web browsers.</p>

<p>For some years afterward, I regretted that the Adobe/WWW meeting had not taken place the previous year, because the sparse and limited HTML format might have been eclipsed by the richer format of PDF as the primary syntax of web pages. With the adoption of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/">Cascading Style Sheets specification</a> (from 1999 forward), my views changed, and I’ve come to appreciate that the technical underpinnings of the web are optimal, reflecting both the genius of Berners-Lee’s original vision and the rich contributions of the worldwide developer community.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, it is easy to overlook the web’s origins as a tool for sharing knowledge. Key to Tim Berners-Lee’s vision were open standards that reflected his belief in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower">Rule of Least Power</a>, a principle that choosing the simplest and least powerful language for a given purpose allows you to do more with the data stored in that language (thus HTML is easier for humans or machines to interpret and analyze than PostScript). Along with open standards and the Rule of Least Power, Tim Berners-Lee wanted to make it easy for anyone to publish information in the form of web pages. His first web browser, named Nexus, was both a browser and editor. The NeXTSTEP SDK made editing easy to implement; editing was abandoned in subsequent non-NeXT web browsers.</p>

<p>I think we’ve lost sight of that original vision. Facebook or Wix make it easy to author web pages but at the cost of lock-in to proprietary systems. And when developers choose complex software such as React or Rails to build simple websites, I cringe at the violation of Rule of Least Power. I still have a “deep case of net religion” (as John Perry Barlow said in 1991) and I’m now writing about ways to build websites without frameworks and build tools (see my articles, <a href="https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/build-websites-the-yax-way/index.html">Build Websites the Yax Way</a>). My current project, <a href="https://yax.com/">Yax.com</a>, is a do-it-yourself website builder that uses new web standards (including web components) to help people build simple sites. Thirty years on, we still have a lot of work to do to realize the web’s original goals. I hope I’m not the only one who sees this.</p>

<p>I never anticipated that Berners-Lee’s NeXT hypertext project would become a medium to supplant print and television. In 1991, during idle moments, I imagined the world’s books and magazines might be reborn as hypertext (many others had imagined this earlier, including Ted Nelson, with his Xanadu project). But I never honestly believed that Berners-Lee’s software project could change the world. By 1999, as Web addresses appeared on billboards and the sides of buses, I started to accept that Berners-Lee naming his project “the WorldWide Web” was not vainglorious but simply prescient. Still, I hope his original vision of the web as a means for sharing the world’s knowledge is not eclipsed by its utility as a platform for commerce.</p>

<article>
    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#blinding-yourself">genuine randomized control trials on yourself</a></li>
<li>Buy research
<ul>
<li>See <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">Appendix</a>, <a href="https://blog.alexa.com/sites-for-market-research/">here</a>, or <a href="https://web.jinfo.com/go/blog/73431">here</a></li>
<li>Or find it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub">SciHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/libgen_project">Libgen</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone to pentest/doxx you
<ul>
<li>Or put out a bounty for it, like <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Blackmail#pseudonymity-bounty">Gwern used to</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
<li>If you can use the gathering to bootstrap a group chat or community, so much the better!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">Sharpest Minds</a> exist for professional training</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone just as an excuse to make yourself complete a project
<ul>
<li>Sure you could proofread your own document.  But if you hire a proofreader, you have to actually deliver them something at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Coupons
<ul>
<li>At checkout you can just ask “Do you have any coupons I can apply to this?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raises</li>
<li>Better terms in a job offer
<ul>
<li>Easier than asking for a raise - you have more leverage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waiving admission or graduation requirements</li>
<li>It’s okay if the things are crazy.  You can always mollify afterward by saying “I know that’s a crazy thing to ask for, but I have a rule that I always ask.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/">Ask obvious questions</a></li>
<li>Buy goods/services from your friends
<ul>
<li>It’s not weird unless you make it weird</li>

This security innovation uses two dimensional (2-D)-material tags and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled authentication software.</p><figure></figure><p><i>Video:&nbsp;“Anti-counterfeiting tech by NUS researchers does reliable AI authentication under extreme conditions” by&nbsp;National University of Singapore, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fz5zwmqfeQ_Y&amp;t=MTA3ZmE2MjNjZDBiYjEyMGQ4MTlhNWJlZGU4OTM2MTgwY2UzZDM5Myxsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608871542">YouTube</a>.</i></p><p>Compared to conventional anti-counterfeiting technologies, <i>DeepKey</i> works faster, achieves highly accurate results, and uses durable identification tags that are not easily damaged by environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures, chemical spills, UV exposure, and moisture. This new authentication technology can be applied to different high-value products, ranging from drugs, jewellery, and electronics. For example, <i>DeepKey</i> is suitable for tagging COVID-19 vaccines to enable rapid and reliable authentication, as some of such vaccines need to be stored at the ultra-cold temperature of -70°C.</p><p>Led by Asst Prof Chen Po-Yen and Asst Prof Wang Xiaonan from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NUS Faculty of Engineering, the team’s 2D-material secure tags exhibit Physically Unclonable Function patterns (PUF patterns), which are randomly generated by systematically crumpling the 2D-material thin films. The complex 2D-material patterns with multi-scale features can then be classified and validated by a well-trained deep learning model, enabling reliable (100 per cent accurate) authentication in less than 3.5 minutes.</p><p>Current anti-counterfeiting technologies using PUF patterns normally face several bottlenecks, including complicated manufacturing, specialised and tedious readout process, long authentication time, insufficient environmental stability, as well as being costly to make.</p><p>“With this research, we have tackled several bottlenecks that other techniques encounter,” said Asst Prof Wang. “Our 2D-material PUF tags are environmentally stable, easy to read, simple and inexpensive to make. In particular, the adoption of deep learning accelerated the overall authentication significantly, pushing our invention one step further to practical application.”</p><p>The researchers published their results in scientific journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS2590238520305592&amp;t=ZDBkYzc5ZmJjZjBjN2Y4ZWJjYjcyYWU4N2ZhMzY1NmNjNDUwMzEyNyxsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608871542"><i>Matter</i></a> on 2 December 2020. This study was conducted in collaboration with researchers from Anhui University of Technology and Nanyang Technological University.</p><h2><b>A stable, simple, and scalable process to create PUF tags</b></h2><p>Remarkably, the researchers do not need any special equipment to create the secure tags. They can simply be made with a balloon, a bottle of 2D-material dispersion, and a brush.</p><p>“First, we inflate the balloon and brush over its surface with viscous 2D-material ink. After air-drying overnight, we deflate the balloon. Because of the interfacial mechanical mismatch between the 2D-material and latex substrate, large-area, crumpled PUF patterns are generated during the contraction. These PUF patterns can be cut to the required size afterwards, and normally, hundreds of them can be made at one time,” said Dr Jing Lin, a member of the research team.</p><p>Next, the researchers take a quick image of the PUF tag with an electron microscope, which is then synced to their innovative software to go through the deep learning “classification and validation” process. “The whole process takes less than 3.5 minutes, most of which is spent waiting for the readout from the electron microscope. The authentication itself is very fast, in less than 20 seconds,” explained Dr Jing.</p><figure data-orig-width="2880" data-orig-height="1620"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/32922ca933e0580cc4e864cde80d8ebc/c63a4c8653de1bfd-38/s1280x1920/10ec3b7e954e357ad6da471ea33a0a91997626cc.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2880" data-orig-height="1620" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;A stable, simple, and scalable process to create PUF tags.

However, the high encoding capacity also leads to long authentication time, as the “search and compare” pattern validation has to be conducted within a huge database. This trade-off between high encoding capacity and long authentication time often restricts such PUF-based anti-counterfeiting tags from practical applications.</p><p>“With our new technology, we are breaking this long-lasting trade-off between high encoding capacity and long authentication time by using classifiable 2D-material PUF tags and deep learning algorithms,” said Asst Prof Wang.</p><p>First, the researchers used various 2D materials to fabricate PUF tags with AI recognisable features. Second, they trained a deep learning model to conduct a two-step authentication mechanism. “We used the deep learning model to pre-categorise the PUF patterns into subgroups, and so the search-and-compare algorithm is conducted in a much smaller database, which shortens the overall authentication time,” Asst Prof Wang explained.</p><p>Currently, the only available technologies similar to this NUS innovation, are polymer wrinkle-based tags. Wrinkled polymer tags are authenticated based on the surface patterns just like the novel 2D-material tags. However, their authentication presently requires one-by-one feature extraction and matching, which is slow and shows only 80 per cent reliability. The NUS team’s authentication is boosted by deep learning, and is therefore much faster, and reaches nearly 100 per cent validation precision.</p><p>In addition, compared to the wet chemistry preparation of polymer wrinkle-based tags, which involves the use of harmful organic chemicals and UV light, the NUS researchers’ fabrication technique is significantly faster and safer.</p><h2><b>Next steps</b></h2><p>The NUS team has filed a patent for their invention and is now planning to push this technology one step further. “We are searching for better, faster, and more robust readout and authentication approaches for our PUF tags,” said Asst Prof Wang.</p><p>The team has already begun to conduct research on other readout techniques to further shorten the processing time. “In addition, such naturally encoded information by the PUF tags could be further secured by being kept on blockchain, so that the whole supply chain and quality control can be transparently tracked,” Asst Prof Wang added.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.nus.edu.sg%2Freliable-anti-counterfeit-checks-under-extreme-conditions%2F&amp;t=ZGZkNGQ5ZmQxY2UzMTMwN2I3MzZiNmFkZjE2YTlhMGE3NTk3MTlkNixsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608871542">National University of Singapore</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Like many others, when I was younger. Owned a Xbox 360 console. The Xbox 360 is one of the most popular game consoles in the past decade. With 85.50 Million units sold. Like any other gaming scene, there tends to be some sort of underground cheating scene, and typically game development company would have a dedicated anti-cheat team etc.
The Xbox 360 was no expection. Like the orginal xbox. It was eventually pwned. Hackers  found ways to execute unsigned code. If youâ€™re interested in learning more in-depth how the Xbox 360 was pwned, or more about underground Xbox 360 stories. You can do so here <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-underground-videogame-hackers/">Wired Article</a> <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/45/">Darknet Daries Series</a>
This blog will focus on counter measures that Microsoft used to try and catch hackers.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h2>

<p>In 2008, when the NEX dashboard was relased. Microsoft deployed a fingerprinting technique to try and identify some hackers who posted videos of them hacking. Hackers often had game capture cards that would capture directly display of their xbox 360, record videos and publish them online. 
Typically would display booting up console, loading game, then loading in to a match. I overlooked this when I was younger, and recently just noticed it. The Xbox 360 logo on the Dashboard (Main Menu) prints the consoleâ€™s serial number in morse code with rings around the logo. Which is very clever on Microsoftâ€™s part.
Xbox 360 underground hackers would often cesor their gametag, and other identifiable information prior to publishing cheating, or hacking videos. Though most forgot to censor the logo area. 
Some Xbox 360 underground hackers back in the day, received cease and desist letters from Microsoft. Some got their development kit, or console bricked remotely. Most just got banned. I wonder if this fingerprint method was used to identify some of them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>Police must have probable cause as well as “exigent circumstances” in order to legally search a vehicle without a warrant, a divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.</p> <p>The 4-3 decision said the state constitution's privacy protections are greater than the U.S. Constitution's and that those protections extend to vehicles. The court overruled its own 2014 decision that probable cause alone was sufficient, given that vehicles are inherently mobile.</p> <p>“Difficulties in clarifying the scope of the exigency requirement will lead to debates about what exactly the Pennsylvania Constitution demands in a given situation. But so what?”&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-51-2020mo%20-%20104639940122582972.pdf?cb=1">wrote&nbsp;</a>Justice Christine Donohue, referring to the state's constitutional language on searches.</p> <p>“The long history of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=00&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=1&amp;sctn=8&amp;subsctn=0">Article I, Section 8</a>&nbsp;and its heightened privacy protections do not permit us to carry forward a bright-line rule that gives short shrift to citizens’ privacy rights," Donohue wrote for the majority.</p> <p>Exigent circumstances might include a belief that people are in danger or that important evidence is about to disappear. Donohue said “the universe of qualifying ‘exigent circumstances’ is impossible to define with precision,” but they must go beyond that vehicles have wheels and can be driven away.</p> <p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/#tab-opinion-1963504">2011 search warrant case</a>&nbsp;that did not involve a vehicle, the U.S. Supreme Court listed as exigent circumstances the need to provide emergency aid, hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect or the prospect of the destruction of evidence.</p> <p>Donohue's opinion was joined by three of the other four Democrats on the court. Both Republican justices and Democratic Justice Kevin Dougherty dissented, arguing the 2014 precedent should stand.</p> <p>“When we become untethered from our previous decisions, we instantly implicate this court’s credibility and our ability to effectively adjudicate the many types of cases upon which litigants look to us for guidance,”&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-51-2020do2%20-%20104639940122585532.pdf?cb=1">wrote&nbsp;</a>Republican Justice Sallie Mundy.</p> <p>She said the previous standard of probable cause alone to justify a warrantless vehicle search “offered a bright-line rule already in effect" and “deferred to the needs of those we entrust with the difficult job of policing.”</p> <p>The court sent the Philadelphia case that prompted the decision back to county court to more fully examine whether exigent circumstances existed.</p> <p>In that case, the defendant had been convicted of possession of heroin with intent to deliver after a 2016 vehicle stop in which drugs were recovered from a locked metal box inside the vehicle he had been driving.</p> </div></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>At the end of October I quit my job as a director of software engineering. Many (most?) people view this as insane given the amount of money I was making. I'm not going to give a precise figure here, but if you're really curious you can check out software director salaries on <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a>. I was making enough that in another 5-10 years I could very comfortably retire with a reasonably high standard of living.</p><h3 id="working-on-my-own-terms">Working on my own terms</h3><p>So why did I leave this behind? The concept is simple – I want to see how it feels to work on my own terms. I know how that sounds. If you've hung out for any period of time in tech-oriented communities like Hacker News it's likely that you've seen at least a few posts about people losing motivation at their high-paying tech jobs and wanting to strike out on their own. I always felt a little cognitive dissonance over those posts. On the one hand I completely identified with the desire to firmly seize control of my time and spend it on things that I wanted to do, but I also had this voice in the back of my head that said, "What a ridiculous first-world problem. Sure, other people set their priorities, but they have a pretty high degree of freedom compared to other roles and industries, so they should be thankful for what they've got. Why risk it?"</p><p>Everyone's situation is unique, but I think in my case the downside is limited. At the risk of sounding overconfident, I am very good at my job, and if things go south I believe I can join a large software organization again. The upside is that I can work on lots of different projects, spend more time with my family, and build things that I want to build.</p><h3 id="kids">Kids</h3><p>A huge reason for leaving was that my second child was recently born, and my company had no official paternity leave (if a company is small enough they're not bound by FMLA). With the pandemic raging and my toddler cooped up in the house, I wanted to spend more time with my toddler so my wife could focus on our new son.</p><p>This has been going fantastically so far. We're spending time outside, getting exercise, playing games, and making progress on simple academics. If my wife had to take care of a two year old and a newborn by herself with no support during the workday it would have been a nightmare.</p><p>It can be occasionally tedious (two year olds aren't the most sophisticated conversationalists), and we are all looking forward to the day where my daughter can engage more fully with other kids, go back to the rec center and library, travel with us, etc, but for now our schedule works. I'm very much enjoying our time together.</p><h3 id="financial-stability">Financial stability</h3><p>I don't have the funds to retire – this post would read very differently if I did. I have enough savings to feel secure, but it will be necessary for me to take on contract projects to support my family.</p><p>I may write another post on the financial details of working freelance down the road, but if you're interested in the types of expenses I took into account when quitting Daniel Vassallo has a fantastic post on it: <a href="https://danielvassallo.com/from-employee-to-bootstrapper/">https://danielvassallo.com/from-employee-to-bootstrapper/</a></p><p>I'm currently paying for COBRA health insurance through my old employer, and in general it was important to me that all my insurance coverages continue uninterrupted. I think that the most important points that Daniel emphasizes are ways to avoid financial ruin when you no longer have many of the safety nets that come with large tech employers.</p><h3 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h3><p>I've already started contracting! I have a fairly broad network of friends that I've developed over the last decade in tech, and for now I'm happy sharing my expertise with them and helping to build new products.</p><h3 id="this-blog">This blog</h3><p>I've always enjoyed writing about things I'm interested in and helping others level up their skills. This blog, cloudconsultant.dev, will be focused on news about the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP), along with comparisons between the platforms and tips and tricks I've learned while building enterprise software in the cloud. I'm hoping you'll find it easy to read and educational. My secondary objective is to build a conduit to meet potential clients who need help with their cloud projects.</p><p>Please feel free to reach out if you have cloud questions! I'll be looking for interesting cloud topics to post about every week. I plan on making conversational-style posts that will help you keep up to date in a less painful way than just reading Amazon/Microsoft/Google press releases.</p><p>My next post will be a recap of the major cloud feature releases of 2020 – if that sounds interesting, sign up for my mailing list below!</p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Joe</p>

<p>After spending some time in TypeScript you may begin to crave type safety everywhere in your life. JavaScript is an inherently unsafe language and there are dragons to be found everywhere and in almost every framework. Most frameworks are sufficiently covered, but what if you design a beautiful API internally that needs to be incredibly feature rich, and incredibly safe, but still allow for the best JavaScript idioms. Well at that point you may have to dive into writing some pretty gnarly types.</p>
<p>In general there are a number of TypeScript TYPE libraries out there, <a href="https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt">ts-toolbelt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types">utility-types</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-fest">type-fest</a> to name a few. These libraries are great, and contain a plethora of information, but they are generally sparse in describing HOW they created their utility types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of great type libraries, but no great documentation on how they’re built</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of this post is to not only expose some great utility types, but also some tips and tricks that I realized along the way. Unfortunately this post requires a relatively strong understanding of TypeScript types and tricks. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html">Advanced Types</a> is a great place to start before diving in!</p>
<h3 id="esoteric-solutions">Esoteric solutions</h3>
<p>A lot of these solutions (and problems) may feel esoteric, and that’s because frankly they are. They are not for the faint of heart, they do not need to be known for daily TypeScript use. They are the nitty-gritty realities of writing type libraries for incredibly complex or il-defined JavaScript problems.</p>
<p>Most of these types come from a few TypeScript libraries im working on, namely <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-schema">safe-schema</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-safe">mongo-safe</a>, both of which I intend to do lengthy blog posts on in the future.</p>
<p>I have tried to organize these with an example of the usage, and the reason why the problem or solution is novel or interesting. They are in no particular order.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>// Bad

                [Fancy&lt;<span>Shmancy</span>&lt;<span>Deeply</span>&lt;<span>Nested</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt;<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>];
</code></pre></div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>// Good
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Shoes&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; <span>=</span> Fancy&lt;<span>Shmancy</span>&lt;<span>Deeply</span>&lt;<span>Nested</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt;<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>extends</span> <span>infer</span> TItem <span>?</span> 
                {item: <span>TItem</span>} <span>|</span> TItem <span>|</span> [TItem, TItem] <span>|</span> [TItem]<span>:</span>
                Impossible;

<span>type</span> Impossible <span>=</span> <span>never</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="reason">Reason</h3>
<p>Occasionally you will need to use the same type over and over in your type definition. Every time TypeScript encounters your type it will have to evaluate it again. Using the infer trick you can store a variable in your type that you can use throughout the rest of it.</p>
<p>You will see this <code>extends infer</code> trick pop up in a few places. <code>infer</code> has some interesting properties that make it useful when defining complex types.</p>
<p>Note the use of <code>Impossible</code> here. We can never reach the Impossible branch, so typically we would specify never here, but I have found just putting never there will be confusing in the future when looking at these types again thinking that never branch could possibly be hit. The use of explicit type alias’s that resolve to basic types is a great way to be explicit in your definitions.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This will not work if the result of your type is <code>never</code>. If T or <code>Fancy&lt;Shmancy&lt;Deeply&lt;Nested&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is never, the whole expression will result in <code>never</code>.</p>

<h2 id="type-is-never">Type is <code>never</code></h2>
<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>// Bad
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Shoes&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; <span>=</span> T <span>extends</span> <span>never</span> <span>?</span> 1 : <span>0</span>;

<span>type</span> Test1 <span>=</span> Shoes<span>&lt;</span><span>'hi'</span><span>&gt;</span>; <span>// 0
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Test2 <span>=</span> Shoes&lt;<span>never</span>&gt;; <span>// never
</span></code></pre></div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>// Good
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Shoes&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; <span>=</span> [T] <span>extends</span> [<span>never</span>] <span>?</span> 1 : <span>0</span>;
<span>//              ^ ^         ^     ^
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Test1 <span>=</span> Shoes<span>&lt;</span><span>'hi'</span><span>&gt;</span>; <span>// 0
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Test2 <span>=</span> Shoes&lt;<span>never</span>&gt;; <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="reason-1">Reason</h3>
<p>It is not easy to test for <code>never</code>. Once one of the types in your expression is <code>never</code> it will <strong>poison</strong> the rest of the expression to evaluate to <code>never</code>. Typically, this is a useful feature, but when you actually need to check for <code>never</code> you can wrap your expression in a tuple. This will trick the TypeScript compiler to compare apples to apples instead of expanding the <code>never</code>.</p>
<p>It works by comparing the tuple <code>T</code> to the tuple <code>never</code>. We use this tuple trick in a number of places. I am not certain as to why it works, other than the fact that tuples make TypeScript slightly less greedy in its evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="reason-2">Reason</h3>
<p>You will often need to deeply check a few things, and only execute some logic if all are a certain value. This can result in an annoying deeply nested structure.</p>
<p>One clean solution to this is to check all of them upfront in a tuple and compare that to the expected results of each. Now your tree is only one level deep and your intent is much clearer!</p>

</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="reason-3">Reason</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will pass a union so deeply that when it reaches its final destination the union has been distributed. This <em>can</em> result in unintended behavior as described above. Since the union has been distributed, <code>value</code> in the first example will result in the type</p>
<pre><code>{thing:
    {[key in 'a']:boolean} | 
    {[key in 'b']:boolean} | 
    {[key in 'c']:boolean}
}
</code></pre><p>when your goal was simply <code>{thing: {[key in ('a'|'b'|'c')]:boolean} }</code>.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to wrap <code>T</code> in a tuple to force TypeScript to not distribute your union in subsequent expressions.</p>

<h3 id="reason-4">Reason</h3>
<p>Occasionally you will process some type in a <code>Record</code> and set a value to never. This is perfectly valid and will throw errors when the user attempts to put a value there.</p>
<p>The problem is, intellisense does not exclude this key from your result list. Sure the type is <code>never</code>, but since the key still exists it will allow you to put a value there.</p>
<p>The solution is to use the new TypeScript <code>as</code> syntax to set the key to <code>never</code> when appropriate, that way it will not be available to the user.</p>
<p>Note: the end result is the same, you cannot put a value for shoes, but the DX is significantly improved in the second case.</p>

<h3 id="reason-5">Reason</h3>
<p>Now this one is a bit hard to explain, but easily one of the most powerful tricks in this post. It has saved my bacon too many times to count.</p>
<p>The example above is intentionally sparse since it’s hard to find real world examples. <em>When you need it, you’ll know</em>.</p>
<p>Along your journey to making a complex library completely typesafe you will inevitably create a type that is <em>potentially</em> infinitely deeply nested.</p>
<p>A little background: TypeScript has a rule that it will generally not dive deeper than about 50 levels of type checking before it throws up its hands and resolves the dreaded “type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite”. This means your type is too complex and it would take too long to evaluate, so it wont.</p>
<p>I will say that 90% of the time this is due to an issue in your code that is solvable without use of trickery. Typically, you screwed up somewhere. However, on the rare occasion where you did everything right, your type is properly optimized, but your library requirements actually do push the envelope, you can use the above trick.</p>
<p>How it works is still a bit of a mystery to me. This is a trick I learned from the incredible library <a href="https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt">ts-toolbelt</a>. The best I can tell is it <strong>defers</strong> the evaluation of the type T until it is actually requested. What this means is just because your type <strong>can</strong> be nested infinitely, this outcome will be tested <strong>based on usage</strong> rather than a blanket statement.</p>
<p>That means if you pass a T that does exhaust the 50 cap then TypeScript will be sure to let you know, but until then all of the T’s that play nice will continue to work.</p>
<p>I dont know if the explanation above is correct and would love to be corrected! In my experience and research this is how it works.</p>

<p>Small differences in the productivity of software developers on a team can easily magnify themselves over time.</p>



<p>On many software teams, one engineer seems significantly faster than the others. Now, in some cases, it’s because that engineer is cutting corners left and right. They get stuff done, but they cause damage. They’re a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tactical-tornado-jacob-dreyer/">tactical tornado</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s assume your fastest engineer isn’t that type. They put out good code. It’s possible that they’re not actually as fast as you think. It turns out that even a marginal advantage for one engineer can translate into significant speed differences.</p>



<p>Let’s imagine a simple team of two engineers, Amy and Bob. All things equal, Amy would be 10% as fast as Bob. And by all things equal, I mean they’d produce the same quality of code, Amy would just produce 10% more. This slight speed advantage could be because she’s naturally faster, or because she joined the team earlier and hence has more context on the code.</p>



<p>That 10% difference can actually translate to a pretty large difference in output. Initially, Amy produces 10% more code. Now Bob has to increase the time he spends doing code reviews of Amy’s code, and just generally keeping up with Amy’s changes so he has context and can make the changes he needs to make. Which means he has less time to write code, which frees up Amy to be even more effective, which increases her output yet again.</p>



<p>Over time, this is amplified. Amy is spending most of her time writing code. Bob is spending most of his reviewing and keeping up. Amy’s slight advantage turns into a much larger one. Other colleagues start to view her as the go-to person, and wonder why Bob is falling behind.</p>



<p>A good engineering manager or senior engineer can detect when that’s happening and try to correct the balance. But often the team kind of settles into a mode where Amy is assumed to be better and more productive and everything is funneled to her.</p>

<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</strong></h5>



<p>Death, disease, and pandemics have always been part of human life and they always will be. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million</a> Americans die every year and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 million</a> people die worldwide.

In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale. These experimental restrictions were shaped by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-exposes-the-problems-and-pitfalls-of-modelling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discredited</a> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196234/covid-19-imperial-researchers-model-likely-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Imperial College Model</a> which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicted</a> 2.2 million US deaths. Many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemiologists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a> questioned these doomsday projections and pointed out that there was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not sufficient data</a> to justify lockdowns.

<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus. In reality lockdowns have accelerated a cycle of austerity and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of perpetual crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nursing-home-deaths-coronavirus-understaffing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understaffing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/nyregion/nursing-home-workers-pandemic-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown-induced layoffs</a> in nursing homes severely exacerbated covid’s death toll. 40% of US covid deaths are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/06/16/nursing-homes-account-for-over-40-of-us-coronavirus-deaths/?sh=54afb581300b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to nursing homes</a>. 1 in 6 covid deaths in Vermont were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/02/vermont-nursing-home-covid-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a single facility</a>.

Unprotected, underserved, and alone, the elderly are also afflicted by the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/nursing-homes-isolation-virus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow killer</a>” of loneliness. Isolation increases risk of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/loneliness-and-isolation-raise-risk-for-stroke-and-heart-disease-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease, stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/feeling-lonely-increases-alzheimers-risk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s</a>.

<p>Outcomes of lockdown are equally grim for children. Even if K-12 schools reopen in January 2021, the average student will have lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 months of instruction</a>. Because literacy and education levels are a main <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictor of longevity</a>, these learning losses represent years of life stolen from students. Moreover, cases of severe abuse and mental-health related ER visits <a href="https://apnews.com/article/anxiety-mental-health-boston-coronavirus-pandemic-massachusetts-004adb5ee0ef17ff4b5e2e294e36ff3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are surging for children</a>. They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy. Shutdowns are accelerating this trend, with food delivery apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/nyregion/bike-delivery-workers-covid-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing their profits</a> as workers struggle to get by.

In March the company saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/camsoda-onlyfans-streaming-sex-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% increase in users and 60,000 new creators</a>.

<p>Internationally, workplace closures and supply chain disruptions will result in the loss of <a href="http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">305 million</a> jobs. <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/employment-promotion/informal-economy/publications/WCMS_743534/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.6 billion</a> informal economy workers are at risk of losing their livelihoods.

In July closed food markets were linked to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 child deaths a month</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food is being discarded</a> and crops are rotting in the fields while the number of people facing acute hunger this year has doubled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html">265 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>. This demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the way <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers can profit</a> from economic contraction.

<p>Today we look at TorchScript, the language implemented by the PyTorch JIT ("Just in Time compiler"), PyTorch's solution for deployment and model optimization. 
We can use it to export models to work beyond Python, e.g. on mobile or embedded platforms, or just to escape the infamous Python Global Interpreter Lock during computation. This is possibly the more well-known application.<span><label for="fn:thank_you"></label><span><span>Luca Antiga and Christian Sarofeen shared many insightful comments and suggestions after the article first went live. Thak you! All errors are still mine.</span></span></span></p>
<p>But the JIT also lends itself to the implementation <em>holistic</em> optimizations that consider several operations at once. This is  as opposed to just writing a better implementation of any given PyTorch operation, although the JIT works for these, too, as we will see.</p>
<p>We will start with a high-level overview of how PyTorch and the JIT work to then dive into the how it enables compiling fused kernels to optimize models at run time.<span><label for="fn:chapter15"></label><span><span>If you want to take a look at exporting models, do check out Chapter 15 of our <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch">book</a>, from which I also took some diagrams below. There we introduce the JIT with a view towards running the model in C++ and on mobile. The book also as a comprehensive introduction from everything PyTorch to how to represent data and a detailed account of project to build an AI detecting cancerous lung nodules.</span></span></span></p>
<p>This tutorial has been prepared in the context of work I did for AMD. Thank you!</p>
<h2>The overall structure of PyTorch</h2>
<p>The first thing we want to do when considering how the JIT works is consider the structure of PyTorch.</p>
<p><img src="https://lernapparat.de/static/artikel/jit-optimization-intro/Ch15_F4_PyTorch_calling_pytorch.svg">

<p>PyTorch most prominently is a Python library, I call this part classic PyTorch. Some parts are implemented in Python (e.g. the <code>torch.nn</code> modules and the optimizers), but the compute functions (like <code>torch.matmul</code>) are provided as a Python C++ extension.</p>
<p>Looking a bit closer, this Python C++ extension is a thin wrapper around PyTorch's C++ library <em>LibTorch</em>. That in turn uses the ATen tensor library which itself dispatches into various backends.</p>
<p>The PyTorch JIT now implements a virtual machine that takes in TorchScript programs (typically created through the <code>torch.jit</code> ) and runs them by calling into LibTorch itself, circumventing the Python parts.</p>
<p>The JIT also is extendable by defining <em>Custom Ops</em>, we'll get back to this. To run PyTorch-exported programs in Torch Mobile or Torch Serving, the typical thing is to implement a wrapper around the JIT api to load and run modules.</p>
<h2>TorchScript</h2>
<p>Now that we know that we want to run our model in the JIT execution, we should see how to get our model into TorchScript<span><label for="fn:torchscript"></label><span><span>TorchScript is used simultaneously for the language - mostly a typed subset of Python - and the representation (intermediate - IR).</span></span></span>, the form the JIT can process.</p>
<p>There are two main ways of achieving this (but they can be mixed), <em>scripting</em> and <em>tracing</em>. Let's look at them.</p>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>Scripting compiles (mostly) a subset of Python.
It takes the Python source code and transforms it. 
"Here is what the function should do", just like normal programming.<span><label for="fn:notebook"></label><span><span>To run the code, check out the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lernapparat/tutorials/blob/main/jit/pytorch-jit-fuser-intro.ipynb">Notebook of this tutorial</a>.</span></span></span></p>

   %3 : Tensor = aten::mul(%x.1, %2) # &lt;ipython-input-3-6dcc6c3c1c8e&gt;:3:11
   return (%3))
</pre></div>

<h3>Tracing</h3>
<p>Tracing runs the code and observers the calls into PyTorch with some sample input.
"Watch me, now you know how to do the same."<span><label for="fn:evaluation_vs_print"></label><span><span>The avid reader will note that I sometimes leave the evaluation last (and have the result displayed by Jupyter if we are in a notebook) and sometimes use <code>print</code>. The main difference is how strings like <code>.code</code> below are handled: Jupyter will use "the representation" as output, showing multiline strings with newline characters as `\n, while printing actually starts a new line when seeing newline characters.</span></span></span></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>

  %1 : Long(requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = prim::Constant[value={2}]() # &lt;ipython-input-5-7d43d0af2e80&gt;:2:0
  %2 : Float(5, strides=[1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = aten::mul(%x, %1) # &lt;ipython-input-5-7d43d0af2e80&gt;:2:0
  return (%2)
 def fn(x: Tensor) -&gt; Tensor:
  return torch.mul(x, CONSTANTS.c0)
</pre></div>

<p>By the way: The specialization for the Tensor shape isn't relevant here and will be erased e.g. during saving of the model.</p>
<h3>What is TorchScript?</h3>
<p>Now that had a glimpse of TorchScript, what is it?</p>
<p>One important difference between TorchScript and Python is that in TorchScript everything is typed. Important
types are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>double</code> for numbers (int = 32 bit integer, long = 64 bit integer)</li>
<li><code>Tensor</code> for tensors (of arbitrary shape, dtype, ...)</li>
<li><code>List[T]</code> a list with elements fo type T (one of the above)</li>
<li>Tuples are of fixed size with arbitrary but fixed element type, so e.g. <code>Tuple(Tensor, int)</code>.</li>
<li><code>Optional[T]</code> for things that can be <code>None</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>None</code> always is of type <code>Optional[T]</code> for some specific <code>T</code> (except in the rarest circumstances).</p>
<p>PyTorch will mostly infer the intermediate and return types, but you need to annotate any non-Tensor inputs.</p>
<p>Another important difference is the binding behaviour - when a given variable name is looked up to find the associated variable. Python uses late binding. If we write a function that calls <code>torch.matmul</code> the Python interpreter will look up what <code>torch.matmul</code> is when it executes the statement in which it is used.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to many other languages, which use early binding, as - you guessed it - TorchScript does: When we compile a function to TorchScript, the JIT looks it up then<span><label for="fn:operator_dynamics"></label><span><span>While functions are looked up at compile time, the PyTorch JIT virtual machine executing the byte code looks up the <em>operators</em> during runtime.</span></span></span> and there and puts it into our function (it even inlines the commands, but that is not the point here).</p>
<h3>Tracing vs. Scripting</h3>
<p>Scripting will process all of the code, but it may not understand all of it. This means it captures all constructs it supports (e.g. some control flow), but it will fail if there is something it doesn't understand.</p>
<p>Tracing cannot see anything that is not a direct call into PyTorch and will happily ignore it (e.g. control flow)
This is also the reason why it will loudly complain if you have non-tensor inputs.</p>

<h2>Tracing and Scripting Modules</h2>
<p>But our models often are not functions. What now?</p>
<p>With tracing, we can work with Modules just like we work with functions. We get a <code>ScriptModule</code> subclass that behaves much like a <code>Module</code> with parameters, state dict etc.</p>

<h2>Scripting Modules</h2>
<p>Scripting modules is ... a bit more tricky. The class in its entirety is not scripted, instead we need to script an instance of the module<span><label for="fn:no_init"></label><span><span>In particular we do not want to script the <code>__init__</code> method, but instead inspect the instance after it has been initialized.</span></span></span> . Then all data members will be collected and methods will be processed in a way similar to how script functions work.</p>

There is so much copy and paste going on (well, unless you have a super memory). Why can’t we fix that?</p><p>I have designed an improved terminal for people who deal with a lot of different servers, and need to do a bunch of different things.</p><p>On the left side, you can add all the servers you usually ssh into. You see their name and IP address prominently displayed. The green screen shows if you are currently logged in or not. When a task you were executing has stopped, a tiny cursor starts blinking.</p><p><img src="https://markessien.com/img/posts/superterm1.jpg" alt="SuperTerm"></p><p>I admit it, I still search the web anytime I need to setup MySQL. I still search the web for almost any DevOps task. And you end up with inconsistent blog posts riddled with ads. What if all that could move straight to the terminal - you search, and you get a guide. You can then click on the commands and they instantly copy into your terminal cursor.</p><p><img src="https://markessien.com/img/posts/superterm4.jpg" alt="SuperTerm"></p><p>Running 6 servers like I do, I probably have about 20 passwords per server. That’s 120 passwords I need to regularly reference - and they are all in my password manager, which sits somewhere very far away (by click-count). What if all the passwords were right there in the terminal - so when I need MySQL root password, I can just access it.</p><p><img src="https://markessien.com/img/posts/superterm2.jpg" alt="SuperTerm"></p><p>If you are installing something complex, you often need to reference history. Either to copy some command or to check if you did things right. History is long, and scrolls your screen. It’s inconvenient to use. What if you could simply show it in the sidebar anytime you wanted? That would spead up my work immensely.</p><p><img src="https://markessien.com/img/posts/superterm3.jpg" alt="SuperTerm"></p><p>(Btw, there is a grid view also, in case you need to view up to 4 terminals from different servers at once.) But generally, I feel the above would make terminal work far more convenient for people who work with a lot of servers.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Law enforcement wiretapped the very service used by criminals to evade interception</p><div><p>The virtual private network (VPN) Safe-Inet used by the world’s foremost cybercriminals has been taken down yesterday in a coordinated law enforcement action led by the German Reutlingen Police Headquarters together with Europol and law enforcement agencies from around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Safe-Inet service was shut down and its infrastructure seized in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and the United States. The servers were taken down, and a splash page prepared by Europol was put up online after the domain seizures. This coordinated takedown was carried out in the framework of the <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/empact">European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Turning the table on the criminals&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Active for over a decade, Safe-Inet was being used by some of the world’s biggest cybercriminals, such as the ransomware operators responsible for ransomware, E-skimming breaches and other forms of serious cybercrime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This VPN service was sold at a high price to the criminal underworld as one of the best tools available to avoid law enforcement interception, offering up to 5 layers of anonymous VPN connections.</p>
<p>Law enforcement were able to identify some 250 companies worldwide which were being spied on by the criminals using this VPN. These companies were subsequently warned of an imminent ransomware attack against their systems, allowing them to take measures to protect themselves against such an attack.<br>
The service has now been rendered inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigations are ongoing in a number of countries to identify and take action against some of Safe-Inet’s users. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>International cyber sweep&nbsp;</h3>
<p>International police cooperation was central to the success of this investigation as the critical infrastructure was scattered across the world.</p>
<p>Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) </a>supported the investigation from the onset, bringing together all the involved countries to establish a joint strategy and to organise the intensive exchange of information and evidence needed to prepare for the final phase of the takedown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Police President of the Reutlingen Police Headquarters, Udo Vogel</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The investigation carried out by our cybercrime specialists has resulted in such a success thanks to the excellent international cooperation with partners worldwide. The results show that law enforcement authorities are equally as well connected as criminals.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, Edvardas Šileris</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &nbsp;strong working relationship fostered by Europol between the investigators involved in this case on either side of the world was central in bringing down this service. &nbsp;Criminals can run but they cannot hide from law enforcement, and we will continue working tirelessly together with our partners to outsmart them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Participating agencies</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Germany:</strong> Reutlingen Police Headquarters (Polizeipräsidium Reutlingen)</li>
<li><strong>The Netherlands: </strong>National Police (Politie)</li>
<li><strong>Switzerland:</strong> Cantonal Police of Argovia (Kantonspolizei Aargau)&nbsp;</li>

<p id="introduction">The Transformer architecture<cite key="vaswani2017attention"></cite>
    has been powering a number of the recent advances in NLP. A breakdown of this architecture is provided <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">here</a> <cite key="alammar2018illustrated"></cite>. Pre-trained language models based on the architecture,
    in both its auto-regressive<cite key="liu2018generating,radford2018improving,radford2019language,brown2020language"></cite> (models that use their own output as input to next time-steps and that process tokens from left-to-right, like GPT2)
    and denoising<cite key="devlin2018bert,liu2019roberta,lan2019albert,lewis2019bart,raffel2019exploring"></cite> (models trained by corrupting/masking the input and that process tokens bidirectionally, like BERT)
    variants continue to push the envelope in various tasks in NLP and, more recently, in computer vision<cite key="dosovitskiy2020image"></cite>. Our understanding of why these models work so well, however, still lags behind these developments.
</p>

<p>This exposition series continues the pursuit to interpret<cite key="rogers2020primer,atanasova2020diagnostic"></cite>
    and visualize<cite key="vig2019visualizing,madsen2019visualizing,hoover2020,tenney2020language,wallace2019allennlp"></cite>
    the inner-workings of transformer-based language models.

We illustrate how some key interpretability methods apply to transformer-based language models. This article focuses on auto-regressive models, but these methods are applicable to other architectures and tasks as well.
     
</p>

<p>This is the first article in the series. In it, we present explorables and visualizations aiding the intuition of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Input Saliency</strong> methods that score input tokens importance to generating a token.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Neuron Activations</strong> and how individual and groups of model neurons spike in response to
        inputs and to produce outputs.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The next article addresses <strong>Hidden State Evolution</strong> across the layers of the model and what it may tell us about each layer's role.</p>

<!--
    <li>
        <strong>Attention</strong>, a central concept in transformers, and how recent work<cite key="abnar2020quantifying"></cite>
        leads to visualizations that are more faithful to its role.
    </li>
-->

<p>In the language of Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) literature like Molnar et al.<cite key="molnar2020interpretable"></cite>, input saliency is a method that explains individual predictions. The latter two methods fall under the
    umbrella of "analyzing components of more complex models", and are better described as increasing the transparency<cite key="du2019techniques,carvalho2019machine"> </cite> of transformer models.
</p>

<p>Moreover, this article is accompanied by <a href="https://github.com/jalammar/ecco/tree/main/notebooks">reproducible notebooks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jalammar/ecco/">Ecco - an open source library</a> to create similar
    interactive interfaces directly in Jupyter notebooks<cite key="ragan2014jupyter"></cite>
    for GPT-based<cite key="radford2018improving"></cite> models from the HuggingFace transformers library<cite key="wolf2019huggingface"></cite>.
</p>

<p>If we're to impose the three components we're examining to explore the architecture of the transformer, it would look like the following figure.</p>

            Figure: Three methods to gain a little more insight into the inner-workings of Transformer language models.
        </strong> <br>
        By introducing tools that visualize input saliency, the evolution of hidden states, and neuron activations, we aim to enable researchers to build more intuition about Transformer language models.

<h2 id="saliency">Input Saliency</h2>

<p>When a computer vision model classifies a picture as containing a husky, saliency maps can tell us whether the classification was made due to the visual properties of the animal itself, or because of the snow in the background<cite key="ribeiro2016whyribeiro2016why"></cite>. This is a method of <i>attribution</i> explaining the relationship between a model's output and inputs -- helping us detect errors and biases, and better understand the behavior of the system.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/dog-saliency-map.jpg">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Input saliency map attributing a model's prediction to input pixels.
        </strong> <br>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Multiple methods exist for assigning importance scores to the inputs of an NLP model<cite key="li2015visualizing,arrieta2020explainable"></cite>. The literature is most often concerned with this application for classification tasks, rather than natural
    language generation. This article focuses on language generation. Our first interface calculates feature importance after each token is generated, and by
    hovering or tapping on an output token, imposes a saliency map on the tokens responsible for generating it.

    The first example for this interface asks GPT2-XL<cite key="radford2019language"></cite> for William Shakespeare's date of birth. The model is correctly able to produce the date (1564, but broken into two tokens: " 15" and "64", because the model's vocabulary does not include " 1564" as a single token). The interface shows the importance of each input token when generating each output token:
</p>
<figure>

    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of Shakespeare's birth
            year using Gradient × Input.</strong>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        GPT2-XL is able to tell the birth date of William Shakespeare expressed in two tokens. In generating the
        first token, 53% of the importance is assigned to the name (20% to the first name, 33% to the last name).
        The next most important two tokens are " year" (22%) and " born" (14%). In generating the second token to
        complete the date, the name still is the most important with 60% importance, followed by the first portion
        of the date -- a model output, but an input to the second time step. <br>
        This prompt aims to probe world knowledge. It was generated using greedy decoding. Smaller variants of GPT2
        were not able to output the correct date.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our second example attempts to both probe a model's world knowledge, as well as to see if the model
    repeats the patterns in the text (simple patterns like the periods after numbers and like new lines, and
    slightly more involved patterns like completing a numbered list). The model used here is DistilGPT2<cite key="sanh2020distilbert"></cite>.
</p>

<p>This explorable shows a more detailed view that displays the attribution percentage for each token -- in case you need that precision.</p>

<figure>
   
    
    <br>
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of a list of EU countries</strong> <br>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        This was generated by DistilGPT2 and attribution via Gradients X Inputs. Output sequence is cherry-picked to
        only include European countries and uses sampled (non-greedy) decoding. Some model runs would include China,
        Mexico, and other countries in the list. With the exception of the repeated " Finland", the model continues
        the list alphabetically.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another example that we use illustratively in the rest of this article is one where we ask the model to complete
    a simple pattern:</p>

<figure>
   
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of a simple
            alternating pattern of commas and the number one.</strong>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        Every generated token ascribes the first token in the input the highest feature importance score. Then
        throughout the sequence, the preceding token, and the first three tokens in the sequence are often the most
        important. This uses Gradient × Inputs on GPT2-XL. <br>
        This prompt aims to probe the model's response to syntax and token patterns. Later in the article, we build
        on it by switching to counting instead of repeating the digit ' 1'. Completion gained using greedy decoding.
        DistilGPT2 is able to complete it correctly as well.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is also possible to use the interface to analyze the responses of a transformer-based conversational agent.
    In the following example, we pose an existential question to DiabloGPT<cite key="zhang2020dialogpt"></cite>:
</p>

<figure>

    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of DiabloGPT's answer to the ultimate question</strong> <br>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        This was the model's first response to the prompt. The question mark is attributed the highest score in the
        beginning of the output sequence. Generating the tokens " will" and " ever" assigns noticeably more importance to
        the word " ultimate".
        This uses Gradient × Inputs on DiabloGPT-large.

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/ecco/blob/main/notebooks/Ecco_Input_Saliency.ipynb"><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/colab-badge.svg"></a>
</p>

<h3>About Gradient-Based Saliency</h3>
<p>Demonstrated above is scoring feature importance based on Gradients X Inputs<cite key="denil2015extraction,shrikumar2017just"></cite>-- a gradient-based saliency method shown by Atanasova et al.<cite key="atanasova2020diagnostic"></cite>
    to perform well across various datasets for text classification in transformer models.
</p>

<p>To illustrate how that works, let's
    first recall how the model generates the output token in each time step. In the following figure, we see how
    <span>①</span>
    the
    language model's final hidden state is projected into the model's vocabulary resulting in a numeric score for
    each
    token in the model's vocabulary. Passing that scores vector through a softmax operation results in a probability
    score for each token. <span>②</span> We proceed to select a token
    (e.g. select the highest-probability scoring token, or sample from the top scoring tokens) based
    on
    that vector.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/111.PNG">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Gradient-based input saliency
        </strong>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span>③</span> By calculating the gradient of the
    selected logit (before the softmax) with respect to the inputs by back-propagating it all the way back to the
    input tokens, we get a signal of how important each token was in the calculation resulting in this generated
    token.
    That assumption is based on the idea that the smallest change in the input token with the highest
    feature-importance
    value makes a large change in what the resulting output of the model would be.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/gradXinput.PNG">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Gradient X input calculation and aggregation
        </strong>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The resulting gradient vector per token is then multiplied by the input embedding of the respective token. Taking
    the L2 norm of the resulting vector results in the token's feature importance score. We then normalize the
    scores by dividing by the sum of these scores.</p>

<p>More formally, <span>gradient</span> × <span>input</span> is described as follows:</p>

<p>
    <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">∥</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></msub><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>:</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><msub><mo stretchy="false">∥</mo><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> \lVert \nabla _{X_i} f_c (X_{1:n})  X_i\lVert_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>
    Where <span id="input_term"></span> is the embedding vector of the input token at timestep <i>i</i>, and <span id="grad"></span> is the back-propagated gradient of the score of the selected token unpacked as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span id="input_embeddings"></span> is the list of …</li></ul></div></div>

December 22, 2020 | https://about.scarf.sh/post/shea-levy-composition-fanatic | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://about.scarf.sh/post/shea-levy-composition-fanatic">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Hello Scarf followers! I'm Shea, Scarf's new VP of Engineering. This post is to share some of who I am, what problems I'm interested in, and why that brought me to Scarf. I hope it gives you a sense of what this new role means for our mission to give open source maintainers observability into the distribution and usage of their projects!</p><p>In my career so far, I've been exposed to a wide array of problem domains and industries. I've worked in embedded hardware, industrial sensors, online retail, personalized marketing, inventory management, SaaS platforms, statistical analysis for research... It's been a fascinating journey! While my roles and responsibilities have varied, over time I've developed a number of themes in my approach to work:</p><ul role="list"><li>I am passionate about the big-picture product perspective. I am not satisfied writing a single line of code until I understand what value we're trying to create, for whom, and why the task at hand helps achieve that.</li><li>I consider proper organizational structure and practices to be crucial to my own effectiveness, not to mention the overall success of the effort. Team values, formal process, responsibilities, expectations, etc. should be as carefully designed and cultivated as the product itself.</li><li>I gravitate toward "force multiplier" aspects of the work. I'm much more likely to build a tool that helps build the end-user features than to build the feature itself, more likely to tie all of the components together than to build the component itself. My success is often measured by the problems that don't arise and the lack of difficulty others face in their work. I tend to <a href="https://startupsunplugged.com/startup-data/selling-shovels-in-the-new-gold-rush/">sell shovels, not mine gold</a>.</li></ul><p>Essentially, I'm focused on designing and building the foundations and framework required to successfully achieve the right goals.</p><h2>Barriers to composition</h2><p>One of the most important cognitive methods in an engineer’s repertoire is <strong>compositional thinking</strong>, i.e. thinking about a system in terms of fundamental components viewed as units to be combined in order to achieve the relevant functionality. We can concretize this as a set of questions to ask yourself: What are the basic building blocks of this domain, what are their individual natures, and how should we put them together to build a system whose combined characteristics meet our needs?</p><p>Suppose, for example, we want to improve the development experience for our engineering team. We break down each developer’s workflow into steps, understand the importance of these individual steps to the developer’s job, and then look at how they lead into and support each other to guide our approach to implementing each individual stage and their interfaces. Or, we want to compute how much inventory to send from our distribution centers to our stores to ensure customers find what they’re looking for with minimal operational costs. In this case, we break down the computation into individual calculations that can be solved separately, identify the inputs required for those calculations (including previous calculations!), and combine all of the steps to get the desired result.</p><p>It's hardly a novel observation that composition is a central activity in software engineering (or really in any field). Why, then, is it usually much more difficult than it needs to be? If I've already done the hard work of identifying which tools would be useful for developers on my team, why do we then each need to manually fight with our package managers to get the right versions installed? I’ve figured out what each of our microservices should do and how they should interoperate. Now not only do I need an infrastructure expert to get them deployed into production, but I need a completely different system for my teammates to run them locally. Why?</p><p>In most domains, a significant amount of our time is spent translating from our carefully designed notions of our systems to the ad hoc, operational, leaky abstractions that implement them, or working around mismatches between what we wanted and what the system is able to give. And that's before we even consider composing <em>across</em> domains! We can do better.</p><h2>Breaking the barriers with Scarf</h2><p>So where does Scarf fit in? Scarf is dedicated to the same things I am: laying the social and technical foundations and building the tools to enable developers to work more effectively, to acquire better information about the value of their products, and to trade the higher quality work that results for the resources needed to go further. In particular, effective composition is a core technical requirement for Scarf.&nbsp; Our entire approach is centered around understanding and improving how end-users leverage our maintainers' products to build their own, a deeply compositional process!</p><p>Scarf wants to improve composition, and so do I; I know how to do it, and Scarf can make it a success. We see an opportunity to work together to make this a reality.</p><p>And so that's what I'll be working on! There is a lot of development to do and many minds to convince; watch this space to follow along with what's next!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

December 22, 2020 | https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/alignment/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/alignment/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Should you work hard? Depending on your definition of "hard," it's a
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504" target="_blank">controversial question</a>. Let's assume a
baseline level of hardness is roughly 40 hours per week of mostly focused work.
In other words, this is your typical "good employee" at a 9-to-5: they do their
time and they do good work, then they go home and focus on other things. This
is very respectable.</p><p>What about going above and beyond? There are two sides to this. Bronnie Ware
says that one of the top five <a href="https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/" target="_blank">regrets of the
dying</a> is "I wish I
hadn't worked so hard":</p><blockquote>
<p>This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's
youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of this regret. But
as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been
breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of
their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.</p>
</blockquote><p>On the other hand, we can probably all think of several highly successful people
who worked more than 40 hours per week. My favorite example is Henry Eyring, the
chemist. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2300985.Mormon_Scientist" target="_blank">His
biography</a> is one
of the few books I've read twice, and he's one of my personal role models. He
was ambitious, worked extremely hard and achieved a lot—but he did this without
compromising on anything more important. He was a good husband, father, teacher
and leader. He touched the lives of many.</p><p>There are additional arguments for both sides of the debate. But what's the
resolution to this paradox? I think it's something that I've started calling
"alignment." Alignment is the situation in which there's a high correlation
between the effort you put into life and the good that comes out. In other
words, it's when your work is aligned with what's most important.</p><p>I hypothesize that the real problem with many of Bronnie
Ware's patients wasn't that they worked too hard—the problem is that they
worked too hard on things that, at the end of the day, weren't as important to
them as they thought. Notice that the #1 regret was "I wish I'd had the
courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
Perhaps the regret of working too hard was really just a symptom of this deeper
regret.</p><p>If you want to spend your life working really hard, it's critical to mould
yourself and your situation until working hard is actually worth it. Otherwise
you have two bad choices:</p><ul>
<li>Work hard and later regret that you neglected more important things</li>
<li>Don't work hard and later regret that you didn't fulfill your dreams</li>
</ul><p>I really like <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">Sam Altman's
advice</a> on "how to
achieve outlier success." I think it describes well this idea of alignment:</p><p>(Update since this got on HN and some people are taking issue with part of the quote:
read the whole post, or at least the opening two paragraphs, the footnote, and the
parts of the quote I ellided.)</p><blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone I've ever met would be well-served by spending more time
thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right
thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on
stuff that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small
handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving
person who is very successful. ...</p>
<p>You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart
or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th
percentile requires both.... Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs,
and it's perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of
advantages. ... And it's often really fun. One of the great joys in life is
finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact
matters to something larger than yourself.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in
certain parts of the US.... I think people who pretend you can be super
successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of
your life) are doing a disservice.</p>
<p>One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard
work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have
for the benefits to pay off.</p>
</blockquote><p>I've had several different experiences with alignment over the past six years:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>For a large, early chunk of my mission, I was completely out of alignment.
I didn't enjoy being a missionary at all—it was a living hell—and it seemed
like our efforts didn't make a difference anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I changed a lot partway through my mission. One of the things I most enjoyed
about the end of my mission was the satisfaction of working hard all day, every
day on something that mattered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although my experience at BYU was positive overall, there was lots of
pressure from the system to work very hard, even though a large chunk of my
time was spent on things that didn't contribute to my education (this
category includes a lot of homework, most lectures, and almost all exams).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being an employee was alright. I went in with the desire to make a real
contribution to Lucid and I like to think I achieved that goal. Although it
wasn't the work I wanted to spend the rest of my life on, I did learn a lot
and the money I saved up is a great benefit to me now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that I've quit my job and have become a startup founder, it's
the first time since my mission where
I feel that I have perfect alignment. I work a
lot, but it doesn't feel like work. I don't look forward to the weekends
anymore; I love every day. Things will get more stressful as we progress, but
I'm excited.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For me, having alignment means being a startup founder because I'm ambitious and
there are specific things I want to build—I'm not satisfied by working on
whatever the company that hired me happens to be building. But all that being
said, alignment is important for everyone, regardless of what your individual
goals and desires are. As with most <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things" target="_blank">hard
things</a>,
there's no formula for alignment. You have to figure out what it means for you
and how to get it. But being aware of the concept is at least the first step.</p><p>I write this all as a reminder to myself. I hope my life never falls out
of alignment.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>STOCKHOLM — Sweden is rethinking its security, and whether it really is safest outside NATO.</p>



<p>Two years out from the next election, debate over whether to join the Western defense alliance is intensifying, setting up a left-versus-right clash on the question in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current minority government of Social Democrats and Greens — plus their allies the Left Party — remain staunchly against, citing the value of neutrality in what they see as a polarizing world.</p>



<p>On the other side, four traditionally allied center-right parties — the Moderate Party, the Liberals, the Center Party and the Christian Democrats — are in favor, saying Sweden needs the security of the defense guarantees that NATO membership offers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pro-NATO side scored a big win last week when the far-right Sweden Democrats, who are angling for closer cooperation with the center-right bloc in a range of policy areas, reversed a previous anti-NATO stance and backed a motion for Sweden to adopt a so-called NATO option — allowing it to join NATO at some point in the future.&nbsp;Parliament voted in favor of the motion by 204 votes to 145.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Issues of defense don’t normally sit high on the agenda in elections here, but since the Sweden Democrats have now moved their position, we could well see more interest,” said Allan Widman, a lawmaker with the Liberal Party and spokesman on defense policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting a “NATO option” is not a commitment to join — Finland has had such an option since 1995 and remains outside the pact — but is widely seen as a movement in that direction. The government has acknowledged as much by so far refusing to act on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign Minister Ann Linde called parliamentary backing for the move “a significant negative event for Swedish security.”</p>



<p>For Sweden, joining NATO would be a big policy shift, as it would end more than 200 years of official military neutrality. The country has not formally taken sides in a war since Napoleon was advancing across Europe, and has over recent years sought to carve out a diplomatic role as an impartial international arbiter while at the same time developing a closer partnership with NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swedish NATO membership would also shake up a delicate balance of power in the volatile Baltic Sea region, where officially unaligned Sweden and Finland and NATO members Denmark, Germany, Poland and the Baltic states regularly face off against Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, Sweden <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/security-alert-sweden-gotland-cold-war-memories/" target="_blank">deployed</a> troops to its Baltic island of Gotland after a security scare triggered by Russian warships sailing close to the island.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian military jets regularly enter Swedish airspace without permission and many pointed the finger at Russia when a mysterious submarine was detected in waters close to the capital Stockholm in 2014.</p>



<p>Analysts say that last week’s vote in the Swedish parliament on the NATO option likely signals the start of a new phase in the wrangling over full entry into the alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can now expect a more comprehensive political debate about an eventual Swedish membership,” Calle Håkansson, an analyst at the think tank the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told public service television.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arguments of both sides are already clear. The Social Democrats’ resistance is based on a long-held belief that Sweden’s “freedom from alliances,” as the party calls it, has served the country well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist has engineered a range of joint training exercises with NATO, such as the cold weather <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shape.nato.int/news-archive/2019/nato-allies-participate-in-swedish-exercise-northern-wind" target="_blank">exercise </a>Northern Wind in Sweden in March 2019, but at every turn, he has sought to underline Swedish independence.</p>



<p>The Social Democrats say that joining NATO would represent unnecessary antagonization of Russia, and risk destabilizing an already tense security situation along Europe’s eastern flank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t want to go down a road of security policy experiments or adventurism,” Hulqvist <a href="https://www.dn.se/debatt/m-tycks-vara-ensidigt-fokuserade-pa-nato-medlemskap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> in an editorial in August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Widman, of the pro-NATO Liberals, said Sweden’s strategy has left it in a security “no-man’s land,” viewed by Russia as part of the “European security system” but lacking the guarantee of the NATO members’ commitment to mutual defense.</p>



<p>“That is a very dangerous position to find yourself in,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While public support for NATO membership in Finland has remained low and steady, in Sweden it has been rising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research by Gothenburg University’s SOM Institute <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2020-06/7.%20Swedish%20trends%20%281986-2019%29_v2.pdf" target="_blank">shows</a> roughly equal support (around 30 percent) for joining NATO as those opposed. In 1994, when the SOM Institute began researching the question, 48 percent said joining was a bad idea versus 15 percent in favor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How the issue develops will depend on the rival sides’ abilities to convince voters ahead of the 2022 vote. If the pro-NATO side does well at the polls and knock the minority center-left incumbents out of power, they could push for a referendum on the question, experts say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson has previously said that he believes Sweden will be a member of NATO before the decade is out and he called the NATO option vote “historic.” In a social media <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIkl1Cdp4IU/" target="_blank">post</a>, he said it would allow Sweden to “update and modernize” its security stance and tell the world that Sweden is ready to join NATO at a future point of its choosing.</p>



<p>“A government can’t just look away from a parliamentary majority view in a foreign policy or security question,” he said. “We expect the government to get behind the parliament’s security policy line.”</p>

                 <p><span>Dec 22, 2020 </span></p><p>When deciding to work on a side-project three factors are needed to transition from fancy to application: goal, motivation, and time.</p>

<p>Time is usually the biggest sticking point for me personally but with COVID most of what I may have spent my time on this year was cancelled. However, motivation was still a huge sticking point until I came across a couple of projects that helped propel me forward. First, I spent some time earlier this year combing over <a href="https://twitter.com/maryrosecook">Mary Rose Cook</a>‘s lovely <a href="https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp">Little Lisp</a> interpreter code. Given what I knew about Mary’s previous projects it was no surprise that the Little Lisp implementation was simple and elegant. However, what I wasn’t prepared for was that hacking on the interpreter turned out to be straight-forward and addictive. However, it wasn’t until I re-discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/wtaysom">William Taysom</a>‘s old Scheme-like language <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090625142941/http://moonbase.rydia.net/mental/blog/programming/misp-is-a-lisp">Misp</a> that I had a form for the interpreter in mind. At the time of William’s original blog posts about Misp I was drawn to his passion and enjoyed the implementations of the language that he posted.<sup id="fnref:dustbin"><a href="#fn:dustbin" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Around the same time I found Paul Graham’s original Arc tutorial <a href="http://www.arclanguage.org/tut.txt">tut.txt</a> and used it extensively to guide me in what to implement next.<sup id="fnref:readme"><a href="#fn:readme" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> All discussion about Arc aside, I definitely appreciate the clarity and layout of the Arc tutorial and found it a great outline for a little language.</p>

<p>Finally, as some of you might know I <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D624AQO?tag=fogus-20">dabbled in functional programming in JavaScript</a> and even went so far as to create a couple of libraries pushing the fringe of fp in js; namely <a href="https://github.com/fogus/lemonad">Lemonad</a> and <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib">underscore-contrib</a>. Some of the ideas in these libraries found their way into my own interpreter which ultimately pushed my code away from Misp, Little Lisp, and Arc into …something else — that something else I’m calling <strong>Tori Lisp — an ersatz LISP for little birds</strong>.</p>

<center>ToriLisp = Litle Lisp + Misp + tut.txt + Lemonad + underscore-contrib + a pinch of CLJ</center>

<p>Here’s a very small sample of the language:</p>

<pre><code>鳥&gt;  (let (x 3 y 4)
       (+ (* x 2) (* y 2)))
;;=&gt; 14

(def map
  (λ (fn list)
    (if (no list)
      list
      (cons (fn (first list))
            (map fn (rest list))))))

鳥&gt;  (map (+ 10) '(1 2 3))
;;=&gt; [ 11, 12, 13 ]

鳥&gt;  ({x y | (/ (+ x y) 2)} 2 4)
;;=&gt; 3

鳥&gt;  (len "abc")
;;=&gt; 3
鳥&gt;  (len {a | a})
;;=&gt; 1
鳥&gt;  (len +)
;;=&gt; 2

鳥&gt;  (read "(push [1] 'Z)")
;;=&gt; [ "'push", [ "'list", 1 ], [ "'quote", "'Z" ] ]
鳥&gt;  (eval (read "(push [1] 'Z)"))
;;=&gt; [ "'Z", 1 ]  
</code></pre>

<p>If I wanted to present a list of features then the following list would work:<sup id="fnref:mac"><a href="#fn:mac" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Functional</li>
<li>Immutable access to JavaScript arrays and hash-maps.</li>
<li>Function auto-currying</li>
<li>Function introspection</li>
<li>Bottoms-out at JavaScript structures and functions</li>
<li>ML-like Refs</li>
<li>Lightweight syntax for common language forms</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re interested in checking out the language then the <a href="https://github.com/fogus/tori-lisp">ToriLisp Github repository</a> has a quick start, test suite, and its own tut.txt.</p>

            <p>GENEVA/ZURICH -- 
	The World Health Organization cautioned against major alarm over a new, highly infectious variant of the coronavirus that has emerged in Britain, saying this was a normal part of a pandemic's evolution.</p>
<p>
	WHO officials even put a positive light on the discovery of the new strains that prompted a slew of alarmed countries to impose travel restrictions on Britain and South Africa, saying new tools to track the virus were working.</p>
<p>
	"We have to find a balance. It's very important to have transparency, it's very important to tell the public the way it is, but it's also important to get across that this is a normal part of virus evolution," WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan told an online briefing.</p>
<p>
	"Being able to track a virus this closely, this carefully, this scientifically in real time is a real positive development for global public health, and the countries doing this type of surveillance should be commended."</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup"><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	Citing data from Britain, WHO officials said they had no evidence that the variant made people sicker or was more deadly than existing strains of COVID-19, although it did seem to spread more easily.</p>
<p>
	Countries imposing travel curbs were acting out of an abundance of caution while they assess risks, Ryan said, adding: "That is prudent. But it is also important that everyone recognizes that this happens, these variants occur."</p>
<p>
	WHO officials said coronavirus mutations had so far been much slower than with influenza and that even the new UK variant remained much less transmissible than other diseases like mumps.</p>
<p>
	They said vaccines developed to combat COVID-19 should handle the new variants as well, although checks were under way to ensure this was the case.</p>
<p>
	"So far, even though we have seen a number of changes, a number of mutations, none has made a significant impact on either the susceptibility of the virus to any of the currently used therapeutics, drugs or the vaccines under development and one hopes that will continue to be the case," WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan told the briefing.</p>
<p>
	The WHO said it expects to get more detail within days or weeks on the potential impact of the highly transmissible new coronavirus strain.</p>

<p><span>A</span>yushi Sahu was ambushed. One evening in 2018, five months after her wedding, the 21-year-old college student was visiting her parents in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, when her husband showed up unannounced, his father and uncle in tow.</p>



<p>As the men settled in the living room, her husband said he had something he wanted them to hear. He took out his mobile phone and pressed “play.” The audio was loud and clear: private conversations between Sahu and her friends and family,<strong> </strong>which had been recorded without her permission. And it wasn’t only audio: “call logs, SMS, and WhatsApp messages, each photo and video, recordings of my video calls — he claimed to have accessed everything,” Sahu said. That was when she realized that her husband had, for months, been spying on her.</p>



<p>This was also how Sahu learned of certain things he had been holding against her. (Her name has been changed to protect against retaliation.) He had been offended to hear her complaining to her mother about problems with her in-laws. And he objected to her talking to a male friend. “He made a scene as if he was ‘exposing’ me,” Sahu recalled. “I was just sharing my concerns. That’s normal.”</p>



<p>Her husband played several more recordings, until his father eventually intervened. “I don’t want to listen to any more of this. You have heard it all? Okay, then,” he said, before reaching out to comfort Sahu, who was still in shock.</p>



<p>After processing the experience, Sahu decided she was willing to shrug it off, apologize, and move on, but her new husband continued to behave strangely. Eventually, she felt she had no choice but to end the marriage. “I don’t understand why he had to take this spying route,” she reflected. “He could have just asked. You know, in India, men can scold their wives, right? He could have done that. What was the need to go so deep into my phone and record my conversations?”</p>



<p>Sahu has no idea how her phone was bugged or for how long she was surveilled. But she has one clue: Her Vivo smartphone was an engagement gift from her husband.</p>



<p>It is likely that Sahu’s phone had off-the-shelf spyware on it. Her husband may have installed it himself or even consulted a private detective before marrying her, who provided him with the phone. In either case, he would have been part of a growing trend of individuals — often, jealous lovers — making use of personal surveillance technology.</p>



<p>According to Kunwar Vikram Singh, the chairman of the Association of Private Detectives and Investigators in India, it’s now common for wealthy families to assess the suitability of a potential bride or groom by hiring a private detective, a vetting that usually costs around $500. He attributes this to India’s changing social mores, especially among urban elites. “Work culture has changed. Values have changed,” Singh reflected, citing the influx of women into the workforce as one contributing factor. “We tell people, ‘You spend lakhs and crores on marital ceremonies; spend a few thousand on investigators’,” he said.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, India’s private-detective services have been growing over the past decade. Singh estimates that the sector is now worth roughly $1.2 billion<strong> </strong>nationally. But because of the sensitive nature of the field, it’s impossible to know for sure: There are no official statistics, and many clients still pay in cash. “They don’t want to leave any footprint,” he noted.</p>



<p>The services offered by the detectives mainly fall into two categories: corporate and personal. The corporate investigations often involve banks hiring investigators to get information on shifty borrowers and financial firms looking for background checks on employees. The personal services range from child monitoring to matrimonial background checks. Every agency has its own specialization. Karnam Choudhary, a Jaipur-based detective who operates the Siyol Detective Network, which has around 1,500 freelance private investigators across the country, says that “since 2016, personal cases make up almost 70%.”</p>



<p>The boom in business has coincided with a growing reliance on consumer-grade spyware. These are mostly smartphone apps that cannot easily be detected, secretly record all of a device’s activity, and route that data to a third-party dashboard. A private investigator’s first move used to be shadowing somebody in person; today, many of them begin by advising the client to present the object of their suspicion with a malware-infected smartphone.</p>



<p>Growing demand for spyware first caught the attention of India’s software engineers several years ago, long before the coronavirus pandemic led to a spike. In 2013, while researching viruses and cybersecurity for his final-year engineering project, Gujarat-based coder Tushar Mepani began meeting parents who wanted to keep closer tabs on their teenagers’ whereabouts. “I could not sleep at night when these millionaires told me about their kids’ behavior,” he said, apparently in earnest. The initial prototype of <a href="http://www.convants.com/">what became his first app for tracking children</a>, EasySpyPhone, was restricted to recording calls and collecting text messages and location data, but more recent iterations can spy on social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, secretly turn on a phone’s microphone to record calls and video, and capture screenshots, all for around $20 or $40 per month. “Parents were very happy,” Mepani reflected. “They learned who their kids are friends with — and who is diverting them. The app has saved kids from being spoiled.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had no idea at the time whether people would be interested in this, but it clicked with users.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Mepani doesn’t sell only one or two products, however; through his Android spyware company, Convants Information Security, he licenses surveillance software to multiple vendors, who repackage it under different names. He won’t reveal the details of these arrangements, calling them “internal business,” but he claims to have made more than 20,000 sales. In 2014, Choudhary, the Jaipur-based detective, used Mepani’s software to launch his <a href="http://spymobileprocess.com/">agency’s own app, Spy Mobile Process</a>. Instead of paying for a full investigation, those who buy Choudhary’s app may use it to conduct their own inquiries, with guidance from detectives. “We had no idea at the time whether people would be interested in this,” he said. “But it clicked with users.”</p>



<p>All of this exists in a legal gray area. As of now, there are no laws in India regulating the selling or purchasing of so-called stalkerware. Nor is there much clarity about the privacy laws currently on the books. In India, it is not illegal to physically surveil a target, for instance, but things get fuzzier when it comes to tracking somebody’s location via mobile phone. Courts have been forced to establish statutes, case by case. In 2018, for instance, a family court in Delhi <a href="https://theprint.in/judiciary/evidence-collected-in-breach-of-privacy-does-not-make-it-inadmissible-in-court-delhi-hc/452288/">admitted evidence collected from spyware</a> in a case concerning a marital dispute, stating that the right to a fair trial outweighed privacy protections.</p>



<p>But staying on the right side of the law doesn’t seem to trouble many spyware vendors. Insofar as they are concerned about legal exposure, most will simply add disclaimers that place the onus on the user. Before installing software, the customer should get “proper written consent to do so by the owner of the smartphone” and understand that it is the “responsibility of the buyer to obey all laws of their country.”</p>



<p>In August 2020, Google introduced a new Ads Policy imposing restrictions on advertising for spyware and surveillance technology. “The updated policy will prohibit the promotion of products or services that are marketed or targeted with the express purpose of tracking or monitoring another person or their activities without their authorization,” the company wrote in its updated policy. However, Google made two exceptions: “private investigation services,” like Choudhary’s, and “products or services designed for parents to track or monitor their underage children,” like Mepani’s.</p>



<p>Private detectives who admit to using spyware almost universally insist that any problems stemming from it are the result of abuse. But what they say publicly is one thing, and how they market their services is another. While Choudhary claims his app is not intended for spying on spouses, a <a href="https://twitter.com/Siyol007/status/670517689576726528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2FSahil-Chajotra-JK-detectives-0f27a3d4a117474eac2b15f591b5d764">November 2015 tweet</a> from his company’s official account said just the opposite. In a series of phone interviews, Mepani also denied marketing his product to jealous husbands and wives, even as his website made clear that these are target demographics. “But you know,” he added, “it is like a knife. You can cut fruits, or you can cut someone’s head.”</p>



<p>However unsettling, the spyware sector is only one small part of a much vaster infrastructure. More than 500 million people in India use the internet every month, creating troves of private information with every click, scroll, swipe, and download. What they watch, how they date, whom they work for, and where they spend their money is constantly being captured and monetized. All this has given rise to a multimillion-dollar dark data economy, in which no piece of information is too personal to trade.</p>

<p><strong>The black market</strong> for data, as it exists online in India, resembles those for wholesale vegetables or smuggled goods. Customers are encouraged to buy in bulk, and the variety of what’s on offer is mind-boggling: There are databases about parents, cable customers, pregnant women, pizza eaters, mutual funds investors, and almost any niche group one can imagine. A typical database consists of a spreadsheet with row after row of names and key details: Sheila Gupta, 35, lives in Kolkata, runs a travel agency, and owns a BMW; Irfaan Khan, 52, lives in Greater Noida, and has a son who just applied to engineering college. The databases are usually updated every three months (the older one is, the less it is worth), and if you buy several at the same time, …</p></div></div>

              <p>As data scientists know from painful experience, bugs in the code usually aren't the big difficult problem. Data itself contains bugs, in the terms of the classic definition of bugs - unexpected behaviors, usually resulting from mistaken assumptions.</p><p>In this post, I'd like to share my personal story of a data bug, which is very indicative of the types of bugs you will come across in data science work.</p><p>At DAGsHub, we're creating tools to make these bugs easier to fix. I'll show how I applied these tools in this concrete case. Fixing data bugs is a challenging process and the tools aren't as amazing as we believe they could be. <em><strong>We're on it though! </strong></em>😉</p><h2 id="background"><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>The first tutorial we made for DAGsHub was a “standard” MNIST tutorial.</p><p>It was nice and simple - maybe too simple! A lot of users remarked that they're sick and tired of MNIST tutorials, that they don't represent reality at all - the data is already clean, balanced, labeled, and uniform. It's just straight-up images. Seeing an MNIST tutorial immediately puts them off since they feel you can make anything look good with MNIST, whether it's actually good or not.</p><p>So, we decided to create a new tutorial, based on real-world data. We decided to use the StackExchange API to generate a CSV file consisting of data from a lot of questions, specifically from CrossValidated which deals with questions about statistics. The questions include both text and tabular metadata. The label to predict was "is this tagged as a machine learning question or not?", which you can easily imagine as either a recommender system for the user writing the question or an engineered feature used in some backend BI or automation. The labels were also very unbalanced, with only 10% positive labels.</p><p>In short, this new tutorial represented reality much more faithfully than MNIST.</p><h2 id="the-problem"><strong>The problem</strong></h2><p>When I generated the original data, I didn't think about sorting by date - I just <strong>mistakenly assumed</strong> that I'll get back all the questions from the site's history or the latest questions. Oops. I think we've all been there at some point.</p><p>What I ended up getting is 50,000 samples, the upper limit of what the API is willing to return. Worse yet, the samples were not well distributed across time! If it had been a uniformly random selection, that would have been better. But I wasn't even that lucky. I don't know what weird sampling resulted in the time distribution that I actually got:</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/compare_old_and_new_data-copy.png" alt="Comparing data distribution before and after fixing the data bug" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/compare_old_and_new_data-copy.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/compare_old_and_new_data-copy.png 1000w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/compare_old_and_new_data-copy.png 1600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/compare_old_and_new_data-copy.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A data scientist's before and after pic – comparing the data time distributions</figcaption></figure><p>The bottom line - although I successfully built a decent model on top of the data, the data I used was broken. <strong>I had an entirely data related bug, and no change in my code was going to fix it.</strong> I needed to replace the data completely. In other cases, maybe I would have discovered that there is a subset of the data which just needs to be thrown out manually. These kinds of stories are very common in real life.</p><h2 id="what-can-be-done-in-this-scenario-on-github"><strong>What can be done in this scenario on Github?</strong></h2><ul><li><em>Case 1:</em> The data is stored in some external storage, like S3, and a URL to download it is saved as part of the code on Github. In such a case I could go to the bucket and replace the data stored there. However, I would lose the old data, and maybe even worse, I would lose the relationship between the versions of the data and my existing code! Later on, figuring out which versions of my code, experiments, and resulting models originated from the broken data becomes exceedingly difficult. I'm likely to forget, and even if not, what happens when I'm on vacation or leave the company? Whoever tries to pick up my work is set up for failure.</li><li><em>Case 2:</em> What if I create a new version of the data on S3, name it <code>data_v2.csv</code>, and change the URL in my code? Welcome to Versioning Hell:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gaeI3db-6IXdHlVZaaTsW_2Sx05ik4VSxpFzgQOu802Qs7z5uZXanuB-_V6Os5Mt_r0bWOpSmLmGpgow_jf1cwCuPq2PQr7bavapBkGT4r2WZgm_5C7Dw1gvfr57zIDflUHz_N6u" alt=""></figure><ul><li><em>Case 3:</em> We use Git-LFS. Git-LFS is an extension to Git that allows you to efficiently version large files. It's not completely a part of Git - things like diffs and merges aren't supported, since it's too expensive to compute them on large data. What's more, you need a specialized server that can handle LFS. Luckily, GitHub does that. Unluckily, there are still problems - the amount of storage you get for your LFS is limited, and it's hardly a full-fledged data storage solution. I would much rather store these large files on some proper cloud storage, and find a convenient way to link them to my Git repo. What's more - GitHub provides very limited information on what has changed when you try to compare versions of these large files. A line-by-line diff is not practical, but I feel like there are more useful things to say than this:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RCMx178HiLbE7qxsZzjz1QXgKePFrAzBc6Et-8VKqz3h7ObTG6ykUy349yB-5SKCvb5F44RniDhhu0aq8BfSHmwoOMc7bPYdGVjNzpuQMDRlU3jWBJ1n5d-7WV4ZlsWASPOGXs7A" alt=" Git-LFS Data Diff"><figcaption>Git-LFS Data Diff (The number of modified lines is also not correct - the file is much larger)</figcaption></figure><p>Even if all the above technical issues are solved, there's one human aspect that's completely ignored - what is the impact of changing the data? OK, the file changed, but how does this affect my metrics? Is the data distributed differently now? Do I have visualizations I want to see before-and-after? In vanilla Git and Github, I can only meaningfully compare text and a few images.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-on-dagshub"><strong>What can you do on DAGsHub?</strong></h2><p>We rely on <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> to connect your data files to your Git commits - similar to Git-LFS, but much more flexible, allowing you to store your data on your own cloud storage, and have many other cool data-science specific features.</p><p>DAGsHub lets you see notebooks and intuitive notebook diffs, which help you understand the underlying data, and create a custom visual comparison of data versions. You can also view the contents of some data formats (more coming soon) as an integrated part of the UI. Comparing large datasets is also made possible by our Directory diffing capabilities. Finally, specifically for issues like this, we created <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-science-pull-requests/">Data Science Pull Requests</a>, which lets you perform the same review process for data as you would with code.</p><p>With all these tools in hand, I can now just replace my data file with the new, corrected version, use DVC and Git to commit the new version, and voila! The data is now fixed...</p><p>...Well, almost. I still need to push the data to my remote, otherwise, the project is pretty useless to anyone not in possession of my laptop.</p><h2 id="setting-up-cloud-storage-is-hard"><strong>Setting up cloud storage is hard</strong></h2><p>OK, so now we can get a version-controlled pull request for data, with meaningful data science information to guide decisions. Our data is stored on full-fledged storage with world-scale capacity. Excellent!</p><p>But let's face it - setting up cloud storage is a pain in the neck. Credit cards? IAM? Bucket retention policies? Service accounts?</p><p>Blech 🤢 !</p><p>That's all way too hard. If we want open-source data science to flourish, we have to make it much more accessible. Well-intentioned people will want to help find and fix bugs, but we shouldn't force them to jump through hoops. Friction is a killer of creativity and productivity.</p><p><strong>It should be as easy as git push, and access control should be handled automatically.</strong></p><p>We're working hard at DAGsHub to make that a reality (stay tuned for more).</p><h2 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>In real life, data is messy, and as much as you need to iterate on the code or the models, you need to iterate on your data and annotations. Reverting to old-school versioning hell is not a solution. Data should be treated as source code with its versions managed, and fixes to data should undergo the same review process that everything else does. More than that - to enable real open source, I want <strong><em>anyone</em></strong> to be able to contribute fixes to my data.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Decisions have always been hard for me, especially when I'm overwhelmed. For example, I break down in front of restaurants because I can't decide if I want to go in or pick a different restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Between working remotely and social distancing, I have spent a lot of time alone this year. The hardest part is needing to make way more decisions for myself. I have to decide when to get up, what to eat, what to work on, and what to do with my free time. Sure, these were largely in my control before, but I relied a lot on social pressure to choose.</span></p>
<p><span>When I was researching </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aslawrence/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Adam</span></a><span> for </span><a href="https://boringstartupstuff.com/newsletter/dec-8th-2020-mastering-the-art-of-the-playbook" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>our interview</span></a><span>, I found his user guide </span><span></span><span>and decided to write one for myself. Both his and the one from the original </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>First Round Review piece</span></a><span> are written from the perspective of a manager, but user guides can be just as helpful for individual contributors. The point is sharing how best to work with you, which is especially important at a time when fewer teams are in-person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I created a template (</span><a href="https://www.notion.so/thekatieharper/User-Guide-Outline-e3130055035b455bab61c5400e96e66c" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>which you can copy here</span></a><span>) and then got stuck. Every bullet point represents a decision that I need to make about myself. My startup job requires me to make decisions constantly, and I actually enjoy that process. But I feel entirely different when it’s a personal decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>User guides are essentially a branding exercise, and I worry that I will get called a liar for my choices. I brand myself as a morning person, a proactive doer, and a workaholic. But I’m writing this at night, at the last minute, having spent all weekend </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> working (though also somehow not relaxing). Are my stories based on truth or aspiration?</span></p>
<p><span>Decisions also open us up to rejection. By listing my preferences, personality traits, and pet peeves, I’m publishing a quick way to judge me. What if someone sees this and doesn’t want to work with me?</span></p>
<p><span>Often decisions feel selfish to me. When I decide what time of day I prefer meetings, I feel guilty for prioritizing my own wants over someone else’s. Writing a user guide forces you to confront the stories you tell about yourself. And you have to be vulnerable enough that people will actually learn something useful from reading what you write.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A year ago I was in a relationship with someone who never decided anything. Now I see that </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> deciding was selfish. And I don’t want to be that way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the end, this piece is my user guide, because it says more about me than a checklist can.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/ledger/ledger_breach.png" alt="Ledger Data Breach"></p><p><em>Post being continuously updated</em>.</p><p>If you think you are amongst the users affected by the latest <a href="https://ledger.com/">Ledger</a> data breach, it is important <strong>not to panic!</strong> Follow a few simple steps and you can check the extent of the damage and keep an eye on the security of your account.</p><h2 id="what-are-data-breaches">What are Data Breaches?</h2><p>One of the unfortunate side effects of the modern, Internet-connected world is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach">data breach</a> ― an uncontrolled leak of data and/or information. Very often is the case that you (the user) are not responsible for, or the cause of, such an intrusion. Companies have suffered (and will continue to suffer) embarrassing data breaches, whether it takes the form of server breaches, human error, or staff misconduct.</p><p>This information can range from usernames and passwords to tax IDs, physical addresses, and even payment details. These lists are then generally sold online to criminal groups who seek to use this information for profit.</p><h2 id="exploring-the-ledger-data-breach">Exploring the Ledger Data Breach</h2><p>I have already written about the <a href="https://serhack.me/articles/practical-analysis-ledger-phishing-email/">massive phishing campaign</a> that has been going on since early September 2020. However, it was only a matter of time before the attackers sold the database with over 1,000,000 email addresses.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/ledger/forum_breach.png" alt=""></p><p>The database containing the personal information of over 270,000 Ledger customers has been posted on RaidForums, a marketplace for buying, selling, and sharing information stolen from computer systems. It appears that the buying and selling is actually the result of a purchase on another forum by user <code>Burgulema111</code>.</p><p>The data leak includes two parts:</p><ul><li>The database containing the emails, personal addresses, and phone numbers of Ledger hardware wallet buyers (most likely obtained from a Shopify interface); and</li><li>A list of <strong>over 1 million</strong> emails from Ledger’s marketing campaign.</li></ul><p>Syntax of the DB file:</p><pre><code>[email]| [name_surname]| [address]| [city]| [state]| [mobile_phone]
</code></pre><h2 id="recommendations-to-follow">Recommendations to follow</h2><p>Below, I recommend 5 (+1) actions to take after such a large data breach:</p><h3 id="1-dont-send-your-seed">1. Don’t Send Your Seed!</h3><p>Whenever you are asked (especially in an unsolicited manner), do not reveal or send your seed to ANYONE. <strong>NEVER SEND YOUR SEED!</strong> Even if you think it is the CEO of Ledger himself: DO. NOT. DO. IT. A seed is a collection of 24 random words needed to retrieve the private key to your wallet. Revealing or sending this to anyone is analogous to telling someone the combination to your online safe.</p><p>Your funds are NEVER in danger if you follow common sense, which is to NEVER send or reveal your seed! Ignore emails that come to you about a detected, urgent security issue or an unverified account. If your email is on the list, consider it compromised.</p><h3 id="2-check-what-personal-data-they-have-stolen">2. Check What Personal Data They Have Stolen</h3><p>Through <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a> and <a href="https://intelx.io/?did=0b6c44ff-0c94-46c4-b8ad-b7cb762ba5c6">IntelX</a>, you should be able to search for your personal email address. This allows you to check whether or not, in addition to your email address, your personal address or your cell phone number has also been stolen.</p><p>By checking stolen personal information, you should be able to keep track of how much of your personal information has been disclosed and take subsequent countermeasures.</p><h3 id="3-consider-changing-your-email-address-andor-phone">3. Consider Changing Your Email address and/or Phone</h3><p>Once your email address is online, you will get lots of emails. Lists, such as Ledger’s, are recycled by spammers and attackers to create massive spam and phishing marketing campaigns. You should consider that email account compromised and, resultantly, you should open emails you receive very carefully! Even if it seems to you that the recipient may be trusted.</p><p>If you find that your primary email address is in the database, it is a good idea to change email accounts. While you might think that simply abandoning your old, compromised email address and updating your social accounts to the new email address that you have created would help, you might want to think twice. There is the risk that email providers can delete the email account and then there could eventually be an account takeover. So, do not completely abandon your old email address when changing the email address of your social accounts to your new email. While we are on the topic, it would make sense to change your password(s).</p><p>To change your cell phone, the procedure is a bit more complex. You could opt to buy a new data SIM and use it for your main accounts (bank, insurance, etc.). Another approach would be to change your mobile number, but there could be risks associated with this. In the first days, since the operation takes time and if you mess up, you risk finding your account blocked, because they often send a recovery SMS to your old number. In the future there is risk, because it is possible that the previously used mobile number will be recycled and assigned to another person.</p><p>Ultimately, be suspicious of any calls and emails you receive. After data breaches, phishing activity often occurs as criminals hope to take advantage of consumer fear and confusion.</p><h3 id="4-constantly-monitor-accounts">4. Constantly Monitor Accounts</h3><p>While you may think you are “immune” to these threats, closely monitor all of your email, social, and banking accounts. Attackers often use social engineering to steal your identity in addition to sending phishing campaigns. Warn acquaintances and colleagues who may be receiving calls on your behalf and be sure to make them aware that they should not trust the individual(s) reaching out to them.</p><p>You should monitor any changes to your medical and insurance accounts. In addition, it is important to keep an eye on your financial and credit accounts. Identity thieves may have enough sensitive information to use your existing accounts or create new ones in your name.</p><p>If you think that your data has been used for crimes, report it immediately to federal, state, or local law enforcement!</p><h3 id="5-never-pay-ransoms-or-anything-else">5. Never pay ransoms or anything else!</h3><p>If you ever receive an email that threatens you and subsequently asks for a ransom, never pay them. If you think you are in danger and fear for your physical safety, please contact your local authorities right away.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/ledger/riscatto.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="6-prevent-it-from-happening-to-you-again">6. Prevent it from happening to you again!</h3><p>This current situation is truly alarming and it should be used as a lesson and a warning for the future. Undoubtedly, there will be many people asking themselves, “How can I prevent this from happening again?” It is important to remember that while the company is to blame for this leak, it can also highlight a growing problem with regard to privacy protections. That is: How can you prevent this type of information (email address, home address, and cell phone) from getting into the wrong hands?</p><p>It is of the utmost importance that before doing simple things like making an online purchase or signing up for a social platform, that you read the tedious and bureaucratic Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

December 22, 2020 | https://dystroy.org/blog/hjson-in-broot/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dystroy.org/blog/hjson-in-broot/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>TOML was originally the only format for configuring broot.</p>
<p>Here I explain why Hjson is now the preferred one.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-started-with-toml">Why I started with TOML</h2>
<p>The reasons I chose <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a> when I started working on <a href="https://github.com/Canop/broot">broot</a> may be familiar to many devs:</p>
<ul>
<li>all ancient configuration formats were already known to be flawed</li>
<li>it had "obvious" in the name so it was simple, right ?</li>
<li>it did look quite simple even if the <code>[[item]]</code> thing was a little puzzling</li>
<li>many of the usual problems of other formats weren't present (more on this later)</li>
<li>it was quite popular in the Rust world, since it had been chosen for cargo configuration</li>
<li>the deserialization tooling in Rust was very good</li>
</ul>
<p>The result in broot is it was quite OK and could accommodate the rich configuration of Broot.</p>
<p>It's still usable and I expect to keep it as an alternate format.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-toml">The problems with TOML</h2>
<p>Most users still consider the language alien and confusing, the structure of a big and structured configuration doesn't clearly appear, and I've had too many reports of users not understanding why the line they added was ignored.</p>
<p>Here's an exemple of a case which puzzles users. <code>chars</code> is an array of items:</p>
<pre><code><span>[[chars]]
name = "A"
value = 10

[[chars]]
name = "B"
value = 11

prop = 3
</span></code></pre>
<p>What the user wanted here, when adding the last <code>prop</code>, was to set a top level property.</p>
<p>But what really happens is that the property is added to the second item of the <code>"chars"</code> array. It's kind of easy to spot in this short example, especially when you're used to TOML, but it's not at all in a big file.</p>
<p>The workaround here would be to put simple properties before the array but that's not how humans work.</p>
<p>Adding a line to a configuration file is something that linux users do all the time.</p>
<p>People who’ve been told that to achieve an effect they would have to add this line in their config.toml file won’t read the whole file to scan whether there’s a better location, they’re used to add it at the end as they do for example in their .bashrc file. Of course, coming back later they would probably try to organize everything but they won’t because their first reaction is that there’s a bug in the application since the added line did nothing.</p>
<p>Such traps aren't really OK when you're configuring a program, especially if you just touch the file occasionnally and don't want to be an expert in it.</p>
<p>So it seemed reasonable to switch to another format but, just like there's no <em>obvious</em> format, there's no <em>obvious</em> choice. Let's review them a little.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-a-configuration-file">What's a configuration file ?</h2>
<p>The patterns we use have quite settled and the model I describe here is about universal now.</p>
<p>For the program which reads it, a configuration file contains a <code>value</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>value</code> is either</p>
<ul>
<li>a string</li>
<li>a number -- a more precise taxonomy here is useful</li>
<li>a boolean -- we can deal without it but it's clearer</li>
<li>a list of values -- also called sequence, array, etc.</li>
<li>a map of keys (strings) to values -- such a map is often used as a "structured object"</li>
<li>the absence of a value -- which is especially important to fall back to a default</li>
</ul>
<p>But before to be read by a program, a configuration file is written by a human, it's read and modified by other humans. So there's much more to it.</p>
<p>First you need comments. There's no way around that.
The purpose of a value, its syntax and meaning, must be explained.
And comments are useful too to disable a setting, either temporarily or because it's here as an example.</p>
<p>Then you need the structure to be clear, the format not to push you towards errors.</p>
<p>You want users to be able to change values without reading everything.</p>
<p>And, unless your configuration structure is very small and guaranteed frozen, you want your users to be able to <em>add</em> properties.</p>
<p>And you'd rather have not too many meaningless characters to add to explain your meaning to the program (I won't even speak of XML...).</p>
<p>As we're in 2020 I'll consider UTF-8 as a given.</p>
<p>So let's look at the offering.</p>
<h2 id="usual-configuration-formats">Usual Configuration Formats</h2>
<p>Here's a list of more or less common file formats, with their advantages and problems as configuration formats.</p>
<h3 id="ini">INI</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI files</a> are cool if you want to set a few properties but there's no real solution for anything deeply structured in those files.
So you always find yourself forced to migrate for something more serious.</p>
<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> is ubiquitous as a data exchange format, with files that humans can read and even create or modify.</p>
<p>It generates few errors by itself and is quite clear.</p>
<p>It maps very well to program structures, and the tooling is abundant and good.</p>
<p>It has a few problems for our purpose, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>it lacks comments. In my opinion this is enough to make it unsuitable as a configuration format despite the fact it's a frequent choice</li>
<li>you can't have trailing commas, which means you often modify other lines when you add or remove one</li>
<li>bracing every key with quotes is painful and unnatural</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="yaml">YAML</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> is compact, quite clear and has comments.</p>
<p>But its space based syntax makes it prone to errors, makes big structures hard to decipher, and it's occasionally hard to debug the indentation related problems.</p>
<p>And it has this strange weirdness, which may matter or not : Do you know how to tell if you have a quoteless string or a boolean ? Probably not (<code>Off</code> is a boolean, see the regexp <a href="https://yaml.org/type/bool.html">here</a>).
This last problem can be lifted with the <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/">Strict YAML</a> variant, though.
And it doesn't matter when you deserialize into the types required by the program's structure instead of applying the format typing rules.</p>
<h3 id="toml">TOML</h3>
<p>Coming after INI, JSON and YAML, TOML solves some of their problems.</p>
<p>It has comments, doesn't make you count invisible chars or put quotes everywhere.</p>
<p>And it has quite a good support for structured data...</p>
<p>Except lists of objects.</p>
<p>I already showed an example of problem but any deep configuration is a problem in TOML.</p>
<p>And nobody seems to understand what's really the syntax and how a human should parse it.</p>
<p>In my opinion this language should be reserved to when the structure is small and mostly frozen.</p>
<h3 id="hjson">Hjson</h3>
<p><a href="https://hjson.github.io/">Hjson</a> has a very limited purpose compared to other formats. It's not a normal serialization formats.
It's not meant to be written by programs: it's meant to be written by humans, read and modified by other humans, then read by programs. It has been from the start designed for this purpose which makes it suit configuration needs.</p>
<p>The tooling today for Hjson is far behind the one of the other formats I mentioned.</p>
<p>Most parsers or deserializers are really just converting with JSON (yes there's a big overhead).</p>
<p>For Rust, as I wanted a Serde <code>derive</code> guided deserialization, I had to write the <a href="https://github.com/Canop/deser-hjson">deserializer</a> myself (it's probably still buggy at this point).</p>
<p>In another case of Hjson being behind in tooling, in order for the blog example below to be clear, I had to select "CSS" as format for the style parser.</p>
<p>But Hjson, while not perfect, is much better than the other configuration formats of today for most applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's clear and almost "obvious"</li>
<li>It's already familiar, especially when dealing with lists and maps</li>
<li>There are less traps</li>
<li>You don't usually have to deal with escape sequences thanks to quoteless strings</li>
<li>There are facilities for multiline strings</li>
<li>You can have trailing commas, or no commas</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole file will be wrapped betwen braces, this isn't pretty, but that's a minor point. Another (small?) problem is that you may have a little too much indentation when dealing with deep structures.</p>
<p>A trap I found was about quoteless strings: The rule may be not obvious, especially the fact that a quoteless string can't start with a colon. A least the error is usually not silent here but I'd still recommend to avoid quoteless strings when surprising strings are expected (meaning you should then use a classical quoted string).</p>
<p>Note that some other formats went the same direction, but not so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://json5.org/">JSON5</a> which fixes some shortcomings of JSON while still being more a general purpose or data exchange format than one really focused on human writing and use in configuration</li>
<li><a href="https://rome.tools/#rome-json">Rome Json</a> which does some of the changes Hjson does</li>
</ul>
<p>All in one I find this format to be less bad than the other ones and I expect to be more convincing with an example.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Here's the current complete default configuration of broot:</p>

                Cyberpwned: Beating Cyberpunk 2077's hacking minigame in 50 lines of Python
            </h3>
            <p>
                December 20, 2020
            </p><p>
                If you have a passing interest in anything gaming related and haven't been living under a rock for the last couple years, you're probably somewhat familiar with Cyberpunk 2077.
                After a long and repeatedly extended wait, it's finally here! And it has a hacking minigame! And getting a good score gets you better gear! 
                Can some quick Python magic give us the edge we need in this cruel, cruel Net? You bet. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A quick overview of the minigame: You're given a square matrix and one or more sequences of hexadecimal numbers, along with a buffer of certain length. 
                Your goal is to complete the most amount of sequences choosing as many nodes as the buffer allows.
                Each sequence will advance in progress if the node chosen is the next node in the sequence.
                When the game starts, you may choose any of the values in the first row of the matrix.
                After that, the values you can choose will alternate between the Nth column/row each turn, with N being the index of the last picked value.
                If this horrible description wasn't helpful, click <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/12/14/cyberpunk-2077-hacking-minigame-breach-protocol-explained/">here</a> for a more detailed one, courtesy of RPS.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All valid paths are considered and the final score of each path is calculated depending on how many sequences were completed by traversing it.
                The path with the best score is then printed to screen.
                The algorithm itself isn't particularly interesting nor efficient, unfortunately. However, it should be fast enough to solve any of Cyberpunk's minigames in a few seconds, so fast enough!
                I'm sure there's some low hanging fruit that could speed up execution, but I thought I'd share what I have so far and update the post as new ideas/suggestions come up.
            </p>
            

            <p>
                Let's start off with the game's components:
                    </p><ul>

    [0x55, 0xe9, 0xe9, 0xbd, 0xbd],

    [0xff, 0xe9, 0x1c, 0xbd, 0xff]

                Let's run it and check that everything is working correctly.
                While most of the breach protocol minigames have randomized values, the "Spellbound" quest involves a fixed state and the best solution is already known. Courtesy of GamerJournalist:

            </p>

            <pre><code>
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]
max_path = max(paths, key=lambda path: path[1])
# [(0, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3)] -&gt; Should traverse 3rd and 4th sequences, finishes in ~3 seconds
print(max_path[0])
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Success! Out of curiosity, I thought I'd try increasing the buffer size until I could find a path which cleared all sequences. 
                Be warned though, the result might take some time to compute since it has to go through every possible path of length 11.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
buffer_size = 11
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]
max_path = max(paths, key=lambda path: path[1])

# [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1), (0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)] -&gt; Should traverse all sequences, finishes in ~40 seconds
print(max_path[0], max_path[1])
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                OK, optimization time! We'll assume that there's at least 1 path with a non-negative score.
                That way, we can actually stop traversing a partial path if its current score (adjusted depending on buffer's size and current turn) is lower than 0.
            </p>

            <pre><code>
def generate_paths(...):
    ...
    def _walk_paths(...):
    ...

                # Full path is added to the final return list and removed from the partial paths stack
                if len(new_path.coords) == buffer_size:
                    completed_paths.append(new_path)
                # If the partial path score is already lower than 0 we should be able to safely stop traversing it
                elif PathScore(new_path, sequences, buffer_size).compute() &lt; 0:
                    continue
                else: # Add new, lengthier partial path back into the stack
                    partial_paths_stack.append(new_path) 
                    _walk_paths(buffer_size, completed_paths, partial_paths_stack, turn + 1, candidate_coords(turn + 1, coord))
    ...
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Let's try to get our original result with a buffer of length 7 again: 
            </p>

            <pre><code>
buffer_size = 7
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]
max_path = max(paths, …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Learn how to configure K3s on bare-metal to run a Kubernetes cluster with just as much resilience and fault tolerance as a managed service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tutorial is a follow-on from my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/kubernetes-in-10-minutes/">Kubernetes on bare-metal in 10 minutes</a> from 2017. The original post focused on getting <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> working across a number of bare-metal hosts running Ubuntu, and then it went on to deploy a microservice and the dashboard. It was a primer, and written to help new users kick the tires with Kubernetes. It used production-ready kubeadm, but only used one master node, meaning it couldn't tolerate a failure.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to provide you with a HA, production-ready cluster on bare-metal infrastructure. We will use <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal</a> for the hosts, automate the boring parts, but do the rest step by step, so that you can get an understanding on what's going on under the hood.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, we will review the setup and discuss other options for running on-premises or in a homelab with Raspberry Pis. We will also compare kube-vip to other solutions for bare-metal and self-hosted networking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conceptual diagram: kubectl access provided by the stable EIP. The IngressController also has an EIP which  routes traffic for services exposed with Ingress such as the OpenFaaS gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post also moves from kubeadm to using <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a> (a <a href="https://cncf.io/">CNCF</a> project), which requires fewer resources for its control-plane and has a built-in HA mode using embedded <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>. K3s has been generally available (GA) and production ready since 2019.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>
<p>We will use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to create the nodes on <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal (aka Packet)</a> servers, k3s to create a HA control-plane, and <a href="https://kube-vip.io/">kube-vip</a> to configure a HA IP address for the API server.</p>
<p>The setup will be able to tolerate at least one failure of a server. So unlike the 2017 post, our servers will form a HA cluster, and will also have an Elastic IP (EIP) configured so that the Kubernetes API server will remain accessible if one or more of the servers becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, the Cloud Controller Manager add-on has several responsibilities including node management, routing and managing services. At the end of the tutorial, not only will your cluster have a HA control-plane, a stable IP for the API Server, but Equinix Metal's (CCM) will also allow you to expose services as type LoadBalancer. Each IP address costs around 3.25 USD / mo, you can find out more details on the IP Addresses section of the dashboard.</p>
<p>Skill level: intermediate to advanced. You should be familiar with Kubernetes, networking and public cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="installtheprerequisites">Install the pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Download <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a>, a portable Kubernetes marketplace and downloader for DevOps CLIs. It will be used to download the tools we need for the tutorial. You are of course welcome to do things the hard way, if you prefer.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh

# Install the binary using the command given as output, such as: 
sudo cp arkade-darwin /usr/local/bin/arkade

# Or on Linux:
sudo cp arkade /usr/local/bin/arkade
</code></pre>
<p>Download the following CLIS:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kubectl</code> - the Kubernetes CLI</li>
<li><code>k3sup</code> - a k3s installer that works over SSH</li>
<li><code>terraform</code> - an Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, which we'll used to create the initial hosts</li>
<li><code>kubectx</code> - a fast way to check and switch your Kubernetes context between clusters</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>arkade get kubectl
arkade get k3sup
arkade get terraform
arkade get kubectx
</code></pre>
<p>Follow the step to put these binaries into your PATH:</p>
<pre><code># Add (k3sup) to your PATH variable
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.arkade/bin/
</code></pre>
<h3 id="provisionyournodes">Provision your nodes</h3>
<p>We will use terraform to provision three servers and two agents. You can alter these numbers, but three is the minimum number required for K3s' built-in HA mode using etcd.</p>
<p>You may well ask why the entire blog post isn't just a single Terraform command. I can hear you Hacker News. This point of this post isn't to do all the work for you, but to help you understand what is required, and in what order. Creating hosts is boring, so we are going to automate that and save you some time.</p>
<p>Save <code>main.tfvars</code> with the following:</p>
<pre><code>terraform {
  required_providers {
    packet = {
      source = "terraform-providers/packet"
      version = "~&gt; 3.2.1"
    }
  }
  required_version = "&gt;= 0.13"
}

variable "api_token" {
  description = "Equinix Metal API token"
}

variable "project_id" {
  description = "Equinix Metal Project ID"
}

variable "servers" {
  description = "Count of servers"
}

variable "agents" {
  description = "Count of agents"
}

provider "packet" {
  auth_token=var.api_token
}

resource "packet_ssh_key" "key1" {
  name       = "k3sup-1"
  public_key = file("/home/alex/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

resource "packet_device" "k3s-server" {
  count		         = var.servers
  hostname         = "k3s-server-${count.index+1}"
  plan             = "c1.small.x86"
  facilities       = ["ams1"]
  operating_system = "ubuntu_20_10"
  billing_cycle    = "hourly"
  project_id       = var.project_id
  depends_on       = [packet_ssh_key.key1]
}

resource "packet_device" "k3s-agent" {
  count 	         = var.agents
  hostname         = "k3s-agent-${count.index+1}"
  plan             = "c1.small.x86"
  facilities       = ["ams1"]
  operating_system = "ubuntu_20_10"
  billing_cycle    = "hourly"
  project_id       = var.project_id
  depends_on       = [packet_ssh_key.key1]
}

output "server_ips" {
  value = packet_device.k3s-server.*.access_public_ipv4
}

output "agent_ips" {
  value = packet_device.k3s-agent.*.access_public_ipv4
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then create <code>main.tfvars</code></p>
<pre><code>api_token   =   ""
project_id  =   ""
servers     =   3
agents      =   2
</code></pre>
<p>Edit <code>api_token</code> and <code>project_id</code> with the values from the Equinix Metal dashboard. The API key is found on your user profile.</p>
<p>If you wish to change the size of the nodes, you can edit <code>c1.small.x86</code> and use a different value. You can find the options in your dashboard.</p>
<p>Now run the terraform to create the hosts:</p>
<pre><code>terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=main.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=main.tfvars
</code></pre>
<p>When the hosts have been created, you'll get output with your IP addresses.</p>
<pre><code>agent_ips = [
  "147.75.81.203",
  "147.75.33.3",
]
server_ips = [
  "147.75.32.35",
  "147.75.80.83",
  "147.75.32.99",
]
</code></pre>
<p>Open a terminal and write environment variables for each:</p>
<pre><code>export SERVER1=""
export SERVER2=""
export SERVER3=""

export AGENT1=""
export AGENT2=""
</code></pre>
<p>Save this file as <code>hosts.txt</code> as you may need it again later.</p>
<h3 id="obtainanipaddressforthecontrolplane">Obtain an IP address for the control-plane</h3>
<p>K3s can run in a HA mode, where a failure of a master node can be tolerated. This isn't enough for public-facing clusters, where a stable IP address for the Kubernetes control-plane is required.</p>
<p>We need a stable IP for port 6443, which we could also call an Elastic IP or EIP. Fortunately BGP can help us there. One of our three master nodes will advertise its IP address as the route for the EIP, then if it goes down, another will start advertising. This means our clients can always depend on a stable address of: <code>https://$EIP:6443</code> for connecting to the Kubernetes API server.</p>
<p>Obtain an IP address from your EM dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IPs &amp; Networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request IP Address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the same region that you'll use for the nodes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a <code>/32</code> for a single IP for the control-plane.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may take some time for an engineer to approve the request.</p>
<p>Once you have the IP, set it in an environment variable:</p>
<pre><code>export EIP="147.75.100.237"
</code></pre>
<p>Add this line to <code>hosts.txt</code> so that you have it, if you need it later.</p>
<h3 id="enablebgpforeachserver">Enable BGP for each server</h3>
<p>Click on each server in the Equinix Metal dashboard. Click on its details page, then BGP. Find the Manage button on the IPv4 row and click "Enable BGP".</p>
<p>This setting allows BGP to be advertised from this server.</p>
<h3 id="provisionthefirstmaster">Provision the first master</h3>
<p>For various reasons, we can only set up kube-vip after K3s has started, so we will create the first master node:</p>
<pre><code>k3sup install \
  --ip $SERVER1 \
  --tls-san $EIP \
  --cluster \
  --k3s-channel latest \
  --k3s-extra-args "--no-deploy servicelb --disable-cloud-controller" \
  --merge \
  --local-path $HOME/.kube/config \
  --context=em-ha-k3s
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>--tls-san</code> is required to advertise the EIP, so that K3s will create a valid certificate for the API server.</li>
<li>the <code>--k3s-channel</code> is specifying the latest version of K3s, which in this instance will be 1.19, by the time you run this tutorial, it may have changed, in which can you can give <code>1.19</code> as the channel, or a specific version with <code>--k3s-version</code></li>
<li>note the <code>--cluster</code> flag, which tells the server to use etcd to create a cluster for the servers we will join later on</li>
<li><code>--local-path</code>, <code>--context</code> and <code>--merge</code> all allow us to merge the KUBECONFIG from the K3s to our local file.</li>
<li>in <code>--k3s-extra-args</code> we disable the built-in K3s service load-balancer, and also disable the cloud-controller, because we will use the Equinix Metal Cloud Controller Manager instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now check your kubeconfig file is pointing at the right cluster:</p>
<pre><code>kubectx em-ha-k3s
</code></pre>
<p>Try querying the nodes in the cluster:</p>
<pre><code>[alex@nuc ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME           STATUS     ROLES         AGE   VERSION
k3s-server-1   Ready      etcd,master   7s    v1.19.5+k3s2
</code></pre>
<p>Apply the RBAC so that kube-vip can access the Kubernetes API and configure services:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl apply -f https://kube-vip.io/manifests/rbac.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Now log into the first server using SSH. There is a one-time configuration option required for each server.</p>
<pre><code>ssh root@$SERVER1

ctr image pull docker.io/plndr/kube-vip:0.3.0

alias kube-vip="ctr run --rm --net-host docker.io/plndr/kube-vip:0.3.0"
export INTERFACE=lo
export EIP="147.75.100.237"

kube-vip vip /kube-vip manifest daemonset \
  --interface $INTERFACE \
  --vip $EIP \
  --controlplane \
  --services \
  --inCluster \
  --taint \
  --bgp \
  --packet \
  --provider-config /etc/cloud-sa/cloud-sa.json | tee /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/vip.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>The manifest for kube-vip will be created at <code>/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/vip.yaml</code>, any files placed here will be run by K3s.</p>
<p>Log out of the server</p>

December 22, 2020 | https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/778-Don%E2%80%99t_think%2C_just_defunctionalize | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/778-Don%E2%80%99t_think%2C_just_defunctionalize">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: CPS-conversion and defunctionalization can help you to come up with a constant-stack algorithm.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Turns out I inadvertedly plagiarized the talk <a href="https://t.co/YlN0MOnN83?amp=1">The Best Refactoring You’ve Never Heard Of</a> by James Koppel. Please consider this a form of sincere flattery.</p>
<h3 id="the-starting-point">The starting point</h3>
<p>Today, I’ll take you on a another little walk through the land of program transformations. Let’s begin with a simple binary tree, with value of unknown type in the leaves, as well as the canonical <code>map</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>T</span> a <span>=</span> <span>L</span> a <span>|</span> <span>B</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> a)

<span>map1 ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map1 f (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
map1 f (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (map1 f t1) (map1 f t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, this <code>map</code> function is using the program stack as it traverses the tree. Our goal is now to come up with a <code>map</code> function that does <em>not</em> use the stack!</p>
<p>Why? Good question! In Haskell, there wouldn’t be a strong need for this, as the Haskell stack is allocated on the heap, just like your normal data, so there is plenty of stack space. But in other languages or environments, the stack space may have a hard limit, and it may be advised to not use unbounded stack space.</p>
<p>That aside, it’s a fun exercise, and that’s sufficient reason for me.</p>
<p>(In the following, I assume that tail-calls, i.e. those where a function end with another function call, but without modifying its result, do not actually use stack space. Once <em>all</em> recursive function calls are tail calls, the code is equivalent to an imperative loop, as we will see.)</p>
<h3 id="think">Think?</h3>
<p>We <em>could</em> now just stare at the problem (rather the code), and try to come up with a solution directly. We’d probably think “ok, as I go through the tree, I have to remember all the nodes <em>above</em> me… so I need a list of those nodes… and for each of these nodes, I also need to remember whether I am currently processing the left child, and yet have to look at the right one, or whether I am done with the left child… so what do I have to remember about the current node…?”</p>
<p>… ah, my brain spins already. Maybe eventually I figure it out, but why think when we can <em>derive</em> the solution? So let’s start with above <code>map1</code>, and rewrite it, in several, mechanical, steps into a stack-less, tail-recursive solution.</p>
<h3 id="go">Go!</h3>
<p>Before we set out, let me rewrite the <code>map</code> function using a local <code>go</code> helper, as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map2 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map2 f t <span>=</span> go t
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
    go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (go t1) (go t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>This transformation (effectively the “static argument transformation”) has the nice advantage that we do not have to pass <code>f</code> around all the time, and that when we copy the function, I only have to change the top-level name, but not the names of the inner functions.</p>
<p>Also, I find it more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>A blunt, effective tool to turn code that is not yet using tail-calls into code that only uses tail-calls is use <em>continuation-passing style</em>. If we have a function of type <code>… -&gt; t</code>, we turn it into a function of type <code>… -&gt; (t -&gt; r) -&gt; r</code>, where <code>r</code> is the type of the result we want at the very end. This means the function now receives an extra argument, often named <code>k</code> for continuation, and instead of returning some <code>x</code>, the function calls <code>k x</code>.</p>
<p>We can apply this to our <code>go</code> function. Here, both <code>t</code> and <code>r</code> happen to be <code>T b</code>; the type of finished trees:</p>
<pre><code>map3 :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
map3 f t = go t (\r -&gt; r)
  where
    go :: T a -&gt; (T b -&gt; T b) -&gt; T b
    go (L x) k  = k (L (f x))
    go (B t1 t2) k  = go t1 (\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></pre>
<p>Note that when initially call <code>go</code>, we pass the identity function <code>(\r -&gt; r)</code> as the initial continuation.</p>
<p>Alas, suddenly all function calls are in tail position, and this codes does not use stack space! Technically, we are done, although it is not quite satisfying; all these lambdas floating around obscure the meaning of the code, are maybe a bit slow to execute, and also, we didn’t really learn much yet. This is certainly <em>not</em> the code we would have writing after “thinking hard”.</p>
<h3 id="defunctionalization">Defunctionalization</h3>
<p>So let’s continue rewriting the code to something prettier, simpler. Something that does not use lambdas like this.</p>
<p>Again, there is a mechanical technique that can help it. It likely won't make the code prettier, but it will get rid of the lambdas, so let’s do that an clean up later.</p>
<p>The technique is called <em>defunctionalization</em> (because it replaces functional values by plain data values), and can be seen as a form of <em>refinement</em>.</p>
<p>Note that we pass around vales of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, but we certainly don’t <em>mean</em> the full type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. Instead, only very specific values of that type occur in our program, So let us replace <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code> with a data type that contains representatives of <em>just</em> the values we actually use.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We find at all values of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We create a datatype with one constructor for each of these:</p>

<p>(This is not complete yet.)</p></li>
<li><p>We introduce an <em>interpretation</em> function that turns a <code>K</code> back into a <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>=</span> (<span>*</span> <span>TBD</span> <span>*</span>)</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>In the function <code>go</code>, instead of taking a parameter of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, we take a <code>K</code>. And when we actually <em>use</em> the continuation, we have to turn the <code>K</code> back to the function using eval:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
go (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> eval k (<span>L</span> (f x))
go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k <span>=</span> go t1 <span>K1</span></code></pre></div>
We also do this to the code fragments identified in the first step; these become:
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 K2)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; eval k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now we complete the <code>eval</code> function: For each constructor, we simply map it to the corresponding lambda from step 1:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>I</span> <span>=</span> (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r)
eval <span>K1</span> <span>=</span> (\r1 <span>-&gt;</span> go t2 <span>K2</span>)
eval <span>K2</span> <span>=</span> (\r2 <span>-&gt;</span> eval k (<span>B</span> r1 r2))</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t quite work yet: We have variables on the right hand side that are not bound (<code>t2</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>k</code>). So let’s add them to the constructors <code>K1</code> and <code>K2</code> as needed. This also changes the type <code>K</code> itself; it now needs to take type parameters.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This leads us to the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>K</span> a b
  <span>=</span> <span>I</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>K1</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>K</span> a b)
  <span>|</span> <span>K2</span> (<span>T</span> b) (<span>K</span> a b)

<span>map4 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map4 f t <span>=</span> go t <span>I</span>
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> eval k (<span>L</span> (f x))
    go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k  <span>=</span> go t1 (<span>K1</span> t2 k)

<span>    eval ::</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
    eval <span>I</span> <span>=</span> (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r)
    eval (<span>K1</span> t2 k) <span>=</span> (\r1 <span>-&gt;</span> go t2 (<span>K2</span> r1 k))
    eval (<span>K2</span> r1 k) <span>=</span> (\r2 <span>-&gt;</span> eval k (<span>B</span> r1 r2))</code></pre></div>
<p>Not really cleaner or prettier, but everything is still tail-recursive, <em>and</em> we are now working with plain data.</p>
<h3 id="we-like-lists">We like lists</h3>
<p>To clean it up a little bit, we can notice that the <code>K</code> data type really is just a list of values, where the values are either <code>T a</code> or <code>T b</code>. We do not need a custom data type for this! Instead of our <code>K</code>, we can just use the following, built from standard data types:</p>
<pre><code>type K' a b = [Either (T a) (T b)]</code></pre>
<p>Now I replace <code>I</code> with <code>[]</code>, <code>K1 t2 k</code> with <code>Left t2 : k</code> and <code>K2 r1 k</code> with <code>Right r1 : k</code>. I also, very suggestively, rename <code>go</code> to <code>down</code> and <code>eval</code> to <code>up</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map5 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map5 f t <span>=</span> down t []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    down ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    down (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> up k (<span>L</span> (f x))
    down (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k  <span>=</span> down t1 (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)

<span>    up ::</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    up [] r <span>=</span> r
    up (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) r1 <span>=</span> down t2 (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    up (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) r2 <span>=</span> up k (<span>B</span> r1 r2)</code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, the code suddenly makes more sense again. In fact, I can try to verbalize it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we traverse the tree, we have to remember for all parent nodes, whether there is still something <code>Left</code> to do when we come back to it (so we remember a <code>T a</code>), or if we are done with that (so we have a <code>T b</code>). This is the list <code>K' a b</code>.</p>
<p>We begin to go <code>down</code> the left of the tree (noting that the right siblings are still left to do), until we hit a leaf. We transform the leaf, and then go <code>up</code>.</p>
<p>If we go <code>up</code> and hit the root, we are done. Else, if we go <code>up</code> and there is something <code>Left</code> to do, we remember the subtree that we just processed (as that is already in the <code>Right</code> form), and go <code>down</code> the other subtree. But if we go <code>up</code> and there is nothing <code>Left</code> to do, we put the two subtrees together and continue going up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite neat!</p>
<h3 id="the-imperative-loop">The imperative loop</h3>
<p>At this point we could stop: the code is pretty, makes sense, and has the properties we want. But let’s turn the dial a bit further and try to make it an imperative loop.</p>
<p>We know that if we have a single tail-recursive function, then that’s equivalent to a loop, with the function’s parameter turning into mutable variables. But we have two functions!</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have two functions <code>a -&gt; r</code> and <code>b -&gt; r</code> that have the same return type (which they necessarily have here, since we CPS-converted them further up), then those two functions are equivalent to a <em>single</em> function taking “<code>a</code> or <code>b</code>”, i.e. <code>Either a b -&gt; r</code>. This really nothing else than the high-school level algebra rule of <span><em>r</em><sup><em>a</em></sup> ⋅ <em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup> = <em>r</em><sup><em>a</em> + <em>b</em></sup></span>.</p>
<p>So (after reordering the arguments of <code>down</code> to put <code>T b</code> first) we can rewrite the code as</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map6 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map6 f t <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t) []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>Either</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>L</span> x))     k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>L</span> (f x))) k
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>B</span> t1 t2)) k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t1) (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r)  []             <span>=</span> r
    go (<span>Right</span> r1) (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>B</span> r1 r2)) k</code></pre></div>
<p>Do you see the loop yet? If not, maybe it helps to compare it with the following equivalent imperative looking pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>mapLoop :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
mapLoop f t {
  var node = Left t;
  var parents = [];
  while (true) {
    switch (node) {
      Left (L x) -&gt; node := Right (L (f x))
      Left (B t1 t2) -&gt; node := Left t1; parents.push(Left t2)
      Right r1 -&gt; {
        if (parents.len() == 0) {
          return r1;
        } else {
          switch (parents.pop()) {
            Left t2  -&gt; node := Left t2; parents.push(Right r1);
            Right r2 -&gt; node := Right (B r1 r2)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

    <section>
        <p>Because there is a significant shortage of experienced developers on the market
and has been for quite some time, you rarely have a queue of great candidates
for a newly opened position.</p>
<p>It’s common for engineers to groan about irrelevant spammy requests from
clueless recruiters on LinkedIn with “We think you can be a great fit for our
job opening. You’ll develop our front-end in KubeScript and you need 15 years of
experience in Kafka”.</p>
<p>This isn’t surprising, given the current market — how much time would an
experienced developer need to find a job? Not the best and most fulfilling job
of their life, but just some job with enough compensation to support their
family.</p>
<p>For a lot of folks all it would take are a change in their LinkedIn profile and
a tweet like “X years of experience in this and that, looking for work,
area/remote!”</p>
<p>Hence lots of developers adopt a somewhat sarcastic stance regarding unsolicited
job propositions like “suuure, tell me more”. It’s probably not the most
constructive way to go, but I’m not judging it and I was behaving like that for
years<a href="https://vsevolod.net/quickly-looking-for-developers/#note1"><sup id="back1">[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What is much more surprising to me is when people transition to the hiring side
of the market and keep the same attitude. They keep thinking of themselves as
"highly wanted" and when they want to hire someone quickly, they post to social
media something along the lines of “Looking for a super-duper developer for my
project, please retweet!”</p>
<p>Yeah, suuure.</p>
<p>I had roughly the same dialogue with my friends many times over:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Can you recommend someone? I’m looking for a Python developer.”<br>
“Nope, everyone’s busy.”<br>
“OK.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why did they need a human to hire? Do they need anybody so quickly that they do
not have time to write a description? How should I refer to someone?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Friends are looking for a developer, want to talk to them?”<br>
“Ehh, my current project isn’t too shabby. What do they do?”<br>
“Not really sure, I can introduce you and they’ll explain.”<br>
“Thanks, I’ll pass.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had this conversation a couple of times and do not bother anymore.</p>
<p>Once I’ve asked my friend a dozen or so questions about their project, pried
some information out of him and got a description that was pretty interesting to
a couple of people that I contacted.</p>
<p>Even if they weren’t hired immediately after that, they remembered it. Maybe
their friend is looking for work, maybe they’ll be open for opportunities in
half a year and you’ll still be looking for people to hire.</p>
<p>But that’s not my job to pull information about your project out of you with a
pair of pliers, it’s not a job for your friends, general public or
candidates. It’s your own job.</p>
<p>Even Elon Musk doesn’t just write “I'm hiring developers for a cool project”. He
describes and markets them, for example
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/667516705116065792">Tesla autopilot team</a> in
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/667519445414252544">2015</a>, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544">Neuralink</a> in
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284642001888047104">2020</a>.</p>
<p>And everyone knows who Elon Musk is and what he does. I’m baffled whenever I see
retweets “Looking for a great frontend developer for my project!”  written by
effectively anonymous people to me. I’m seeing the same tweets with minor
variations pretty regularly for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do to have good candidates is to write a good honest
description of a project together with the tasks that a person will accomplish
if hired. And it must be you who writes it — a hiring manager, not a poor
recruiter whom you've given a list of five-to-ten buzzwords.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes<a href="#notes" aria-label="Anchor link for: notes">🔗</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://vsevolod.net/quickly-looking-for-developers/#back1"><sup id="note1">[1]</sup></a> For context: I was a professional
developer since 2006 and for half of that time I’m much more often on the hiring
side.</p>

<p>Greetings fellow Nim adventurers! Below you will find 16 handy Nim tips
&amp; tricks I came across while developing a medium-sized GUI program this year,
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/gridmonger">Gridmonger</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/koi">and</a>
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-riff">related</a>
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-binstreams">libraries</a>).  Some of them are
about less known or undocumented Nim features or standard library functions,
a few are workarounds for some rough edges of the language, and there’s also
a handful of useful techniques I read about in forums or have invented on my
own.</p>

<p>All tips are for Nim 1.4.2 and beyond, and most are applicable to the
C backend. I hope you’ll find something useful here that will make your time
with Nim more enjoyable and productive!</p>

<h3 id="1--reducing-executable-size-by-stripping-debug-symbols">1 &nbsp; Reducing executable size by stripping debug symbols</h3>

<p>Nim touts itself as a language capable of generating small native binaries.
But just naively compiling some program with <code>nim c -d:release</code> and looking at
the file sizes will make you wonder about the validity of that claim!</p>

<p>A release build of <a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/gridmonger">Gridmonger</a>
weighs around 12 megs. Anything but small, if you ask me!<sup id="fnref:small" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:small">1</a></sup> Sure, it
statically links <a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-glfw">GLFW</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-nanovg">NanoVG</a> and a bunch of other Nim
libraries, but to put things into perspective, <a href="https://reaper.fm/">REAPER</a> (a
highly-advanced and complex DAW written in C/C++) is about the same size at
~13 megs! Surely, my program is much simpler than REAPER, so what’s going on
here?</p>

<p>It turns out that gcc debug symbols are included in Nim binaries by default,
which can account for a quite substantial 2-to 5-fold size increase! Luckily,
we can remove them easily with the <code>strip</code> command which comes with gcc.</p>

<p>How about trying to optimise for a small executable with <code>--opt:size</code>?  Sure,
that would yield about 30% smaller binaries, but at the expense of some
potential runtime performance loss. So while it might not always be the best
option, but you can always it <em>and</em> strip the debug symbols for even bigger
savings.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re hell-bent on producing smallest possible binary,
compressing it with an executable packer like <a href="https://upx.github.io/">UPX</a>
could be just the ticket.</p>

<p>The below table summarises my findings with some concrete data:</p>

<p>It is important to note that the presence of debug symbols in a binary <em>does
not</em> affect its runtime performance whatsoever. This is because debug symbols
are not even loaded into memory during normal use, only when debugging. So
really it only affects the space the executable takes up on disk.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering, you’ll still get nice Nim stack traces with
a stripped binary if you compiled it with <code>-d:debug</code> or <code>--stacktrace=on
--linetrace=on</code> (more on that in the next tip).</p>

<h3 id="2--release-builds-with-exception-logging">2 &nbsp; Release builds with exception logging</h3>

<p>Creating a release build with <code>-d:release</code> gives you a speed boost, but at
the price of turning off stack traces (among other things). This can be a problem
if you’re trying to implement a crash-reporting mechanism for end-users,
which involves surrounding your main method with a <code>try/except</code> block and
writing exceptions with stack traces to a log file.</p>

<p>Luckily, you don’t need to ship debug builds to your users just to be able to
do that; you can still use <code>-d:release</code> to get most optimisation benefits
while turning stack traces back on with <code>--stacktrace=on --linetrace=on</code>. The
performance of the resulting binary might be a bit slower, but you know, life
is all about the right trade-offs.</p>

<h3 id="3--switching-to-arcorc">3 &nbsp; Switching to ARC/ORC</h3>

<p>Nim defaults to the <code>refc</code> garbage collector (deferred reference counting with
a mark &amp; sweep phase for cycle collection), which works very well, even for
soft-realtime requirements. But did you know that there has been a brand new
GC introduced in 1.2.x that offers reduced memory footprint and even better
performance in most cases?</p>

<p>This is ARC, the fully deterministic Automatic Reference Counting garbage
collector. Switching to ARC is as easy as supplying the <code>--gc:arc</code> option to
the compiler. It’s a drop-in replacement for most programs. Depending on your
program, you might want to use it with the <code>--deepcopy:on
--hint[Performance]:off</code> options.</p>

<p>ARC has many other benefits, including hard realtime support, shared heaps
between threads, and simplifying the C FFI.  Mind you, ARC cannot handle
cyclic data structures. But it has a big brother called ORC, which adds support
for that.</p>

<p>You can learn more about ARC and ORC in this <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/10/15/introduction-to-arc-orc-in-nim.html">excellent blog
post</a>
on the Nim website.</p>

<h3 id="4--executable-icons-on-windows-mingw">4 &nbsp; Executable icons on Windows (MinGW)</h3>

<p>Setting the icon for Windows executables is probably easier with Visual
Studio, but anyhow, here are the instructions for gcc/MinGW that I’m using.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, you’ll need to generate an <code>.ico</code> file that contains your icon image
in multiple resolutions. There’s lots of online tools for that, and there’s
also ImageMagick—this is outside the scope of this article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have your image, you’ll need to create a resource definition <code>.rc</code>
file that references your icon file. I used <code>appicon</code> here for the ID, but
you can use any other string, it doesn’t matter:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> appicon ICON "gridmonger.ico"
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next step is to create the resource object file from the <code>.rc</code> file
(<code>windres</code> is included in MinGW):</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> windres gridmonger.rc -O coff -o gridmonger.res
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we need to instruct the compiler to link the resource file
into our program:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> <span>when</span> <span>defined</span><span>(</span><span>windows</span><span>):</span>
   <span>{.</span><span>link</span><span>:</span> <span>"icons/gridmonger.res"</span><span>.}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="5--debug-echo-in-windows-gui-programs-mingw">5 &nbsp; Debug echo in Windows GUI programs (MinGW)</h3>

<p>This will be a rather short one but it took me a while to figure it out. It
turns out that when you link against the Windows libraries by passing
<code>-mwindows</code> to the linker (<code>-L:-mwindows</code>), you won’t be able to print stuff
the console with <code>echo</code> anymore.</p>

<p>“But this is a useless tip, of course you need to link against the Windows
libs in a GUI program!”, I hear you say. Well, not necessarily. In GLFW apps,
for example, you can get away with not linking against the Windows libs in
many cases. For instance, in Gridmonger I only need <code>-mwindows</code> so I can open
the standard open and save system dialogs. In my debug builds, I don’t link
against the Windows libs and I conditionally turn the calls to the dialog
functions to no-ops, and then I can do my debug printing to the console.</p>



<h3 id="6--using-keyword">6 &nbsp; ‘using’ keyword</h3>

<p>The
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#statements-and-expressions-using-statement">using</a>
keyword is a very useful, but often forgotten language feature. It helps to
cut down on redundancy when creating method call style APIs, or when passing
context objects around.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Without `using`</span>
<span>proc </span><span>getFloor</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>:</span> <span>Level</span><span>,</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>:</span> <span>Natural</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>AppContext</span><span>):</span> <span>Floor</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

<span># With `using`</span>
<span>using</span> <span>l</span><span>:</span> <span>Level</span>
<span>using</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>AppContext</span>

<span>proc </span><span>getFloor</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>:</span> <span>Natural</span><span>;</span> <span>a</span><span>):</span> <span>Floor</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>proc </span><span>setFloor</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>:</span> <span>Natural</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Floor</span><span>;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="7--opening-urls-in-the-default-browser">7 &nbsp; Opening URLs in the default browser</h3>

<p>Did you know that the standard library has
a <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/browsers.html">browsers</a> module for the sole
purpose of opening URLs in the OS default browser in a cross-platform way?
In fact, I’ve been using Nim for 4 years and I’ve learned about this just
recently!</p>

<p>This is very handy if you want to navigate the user to a program’s website
from a desktop app, or to open local HTML documentation.</p>

<h3 id="8--cross-platform-home-and-config-directories">8 &nbsp; Cross-platform home and config directories</h3>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html#getHomeDir">getHomeDir()</a> and
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html#getConfigDir">getConfigDir()</a> from the
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html">os</a> module are super handy if you need to
handle configuration files or program data in a cross-platform way.</p>

<h3 id="9--debug-dumping-expressions">9 &nbsp; Debug dumping expressions</h3>

<p>However sophisticated modern development tools might be, just echoing stuff to
the console is still one of the easiest and quickest ways to debug a program.
But writing things like <code>echo "foo: ", foo</code> for the hundredth time gets old
really fast. The <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/sugar.html#dump.m%2Cuntyped">dump</a>
macro in the standard <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/sugar.html">sugar</a> module
helps with exactly that.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out the other useful additions the module introduces!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sugar</span>

<span>var</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
  <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"frobnicate"</span>
  <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span>

<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span># prints:</span>
<span># a = 42</span>
<span># s = frobnicate</span>
<span># a + x = 49</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="10--measuring-elapsed-time">10 &nbsp; Measuring elapsed time</h3>

<p>Although you can use the regular <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/times.html">times</a>
module to measure elapsed time, to do it properly you really need a monotonic
timer. Such a thing has been added to the standard library recently in the
form of <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/monotimes.html">std/monotimes</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>os</span>
<span>import</span> <span>std</span><span>/</span><span>monotimes</span>
<span>import</span> <span>times</span>

  <span>inNanoseconds</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>).</span><span>float64</span> <span>*</span> <span>1e-6</span>

<span>let</span> <span>t0</span> <span>=</span> <span>getMonoTime</span><span>()</span>
<span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span> <span># do something for a while</span>
<span>let</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>getMonoTime</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>t0</span>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Your new API backend for the jamstack</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p><br>
Last month we talked about a new architecture pattern, <a href="https://blog.m3o.com/2020/11/12/netlify-for-the-frontend-micro-for-the-backend.html">Netlify for the frontend, Micro for the backend</a>. As the frontend has evolved towards being dominated by the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>, we believe the backend also requires a fundamental shift in it’s design and consumption model.</p>

<p>Netlify, while largely agnostic of framework usage, has promoted decomposition of the traditional stack to something more driven by microservices and APIs. 
<a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a> has long been an advocate for that, both as an <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">open source</a> project and now as a hosted platform called 
<a href="https://blog.m3o.com/2020/11/05/m3o-open-to-the-world.html">M3O</a>.</p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>

<p>If you want to skip right to getting started head to the <a href="https://m3o.com/signup">m3o.com/signup</a>.</p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-the-backend">Evolution of the Backend</h2>

<p>But what’s more, we’re seeing a need from the backend to evolve beyond providing traditional infrastructure services. It’s no longer enough to just focus on
authentication, configuration, storage, hosting, etc. What we really need is higher level APIs that provide business level value.</p>

<p>The most prime examples are Stripe, Twilio, Sengrid and Segment. Who focus on APIs for finance, communications and analytics. AWS, Google and others are providing 
coverage for infra level APIs.</p>

<p>What we really need is the next layer of abstraction. We need the building blocks for new types of APIs and services. Micro acts as a platform for these 
services and now we want to move into offering the next level of value add services.</p>

<h2 id="composition-and-value-add">Composition and Value Add</h2>

<p>What’s clear when working with microservices is that there’s an ability to decompose systems into smaller domain specific reusable services and then aggregate back 
up into many forms as value add services, products and then businesses.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/building-blocks.png">
</center>

<p>As you can see in this image and probably from common experience, most businesses are composed of the same generic building blocks from the infrastructure all the 
way up. It’s only when we get to the business specific requirements that we need our own services to handle that logic.</p>

<p>It’s insane that most of us continue to build the same systems on the backend over and over rather than reusing and building on the foundations of each others 
work. GitHub enabled this for open source at an accelerated pace but we’ve yet to see the same emerge for business logic, services and APIs.</p>

<p>It’s now our goal to facilitate this with a single unified platform and reusable services.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-micro-services">Introducing Micro Services</h2>

<p>Today we’re unveiling <a href="https://github.com/micro/services"><strong>Micro Services</strong></a>, a set of reusable building block services which can be used on the Micro Platform 
whether you’re self hosting the <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">open source</a> project or using our managed platform <a href="https://m3o.com/">M3O</a>.</p>

<p>Browse directly to <a href="https://github.com/micro/services">github.com/micro/services</a> if you want to read through the code or kick the tyres locally.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/micro-services.png">
</center>



<h3 id="services-included">Services Included</h3>

<p>We’re including 10 services from the get go (available in <a href="https://github.com/micro/services">github.com/micro/services</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Helloworld</strong> - The canonical helloworld to kick the tyres</li>
  <li><strong>Chat</strong> - Messaging as an api to embed anywhere</li>
  <li><strong>Posts</strong> - The foundation for a headless CMS</li>
  <li><strong>Comments</strong> - Add comments to posts or replies to your app</li>
  <li><strong>Tags</strong> - Categorise your posts for quick searching</li>
  <li><strong>Feeds</strong> - Crawl and index RSS feeds into your posts service</li>
  <li><strong>Location</strong> - Realtime gps point location tracking and search</li>
  <li><strong>Messages</strong> - An inbox for private messages and related</li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong> - Simple todo notes, lists, etc</li>
  <li><strong>Users</strong> - User management and authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above services are available to explore and deploy when logged in on <a href="https://web.m3o.com/">web.m3o.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-on-the-web">Getting Started on the Web</h2>

<p>As part of this announcement we’re releasing our new Web UI to quickly get up and running.</p>

<p>Head to <a href="https://m3o.com/signup">m3o.com/signup</a> to get started.</p>

<h3 id="deploy-services">Deploy Services</h3>

<p>When logged in you can head to the <a href="https://web.m3o.com/service/new">new service page</a> to explore and deploy any of the above 
plus any other Micro services you’ve built yourself directly from a public git url.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/new-service.png">
</center>

<h3 id="explore-api-endpoints">Explore API Endpoints</h3>

<p>After selecting and running a service, an instance of it gets deployed to your namespace. Once the service deploys it’s API endpoints can be explored and 
called directly from the web UI along with its running status and logs.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/callendpoint.png">
</center>


<h3 id="embed-services-using-microjs">Embed Services using Micro.JS</h3>

<p>All the services running can also be called from Javascript easily (currently only a vanilla JS client is available, more is coming), using what we call 
<strong>micro.js</strong>. See the embed tab for the code.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/microjs.png">
</center>
<p><br>
Micro.js provides a simple way to call services running on the platform, including handling authentication using a popup for login/registration, 
making it easy to add your micro services anywhere on the web.</p>

<p>For those interested in a typescript implementation of login, signup, user read and token refreshing API calls, the 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/web/blob/main/src/app/user.service.ts">relevant web dashboard code</a> can be useful.</p>

<h2 id="build-your-own">Build Your Own</h2>

<p>Two weeks ago I stumbled upon the concept of <a href="http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2016/bridges2016-359.pdf">prime portraits</a>. In short, prime portraits are pictures in which each color is assigned a number. When we align every pixel, the result should be a prime number. Because I could not find the code used in the article, I decided to recreate these prime portraits in Python – in color! Below is the Jupyter Notebook with the code (<a href="https://github.com/rmeertens/prime_portraitshttps://github.com/rmeertens/prime_portraits">also available on Github</a>) I used to generate the Mona Lisa:</p>

<h2 id="The-concept">The concept</h2>
<p>A prime portrait is a prime number formatted as a matrix with X digits per line. When we select a color for each digit, we can generate an image.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this for many prime numbers and color schemes until you find something that resembles a known image, I have turned the process around. I have taken iconic images, such as the Mona Lisa and Starry Night, and converted them to images with only 10 colors. I assigned a digit to each color. Then I generated many similar images with a little bit of ‘noise’ added. The noise changed the colors in the images slightly, and thus the digits. If the digits in the image formed a prime number, I found a prime portrait!</p>

<h2 id="Testing-for-primality">Testing for primality</h2>
<p>When working with extremely long primes, the naive method of testing each divisor will take way too much time. There are a lot of prime numbers and checking your number for each possible divisor takes too long to test a lot of prime portraits.</p>
<p>Instead we take a probabilistic approach to the prime numbers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test">Miller Rabin</a> test uses heuristics to determine if a number is (probably) prime or not. I downloaded the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test#Python:_Probably_correct_answers">following code for the Miller-Rabin primality test from Rosetta code</a> to check for primality:</p>

<h2 id="Generating-the-images">Generating the images</h2>
<p>The basis of the algorithm is generating images with only 10 possible color values. I did not know what a common approach to this is, so I thought applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means algorithm</a> would work. To do this, I reshaped an input image (so each pixel is a point in 3D space), clustered this, and used the 10 created clusters as color values. Sidenote: when your hammer is machine learning, everything looks like a nail…</p>
<p>Important for the prime generation is that you add a little bit of noise to the original image to create images that look the same, but are slightly different. This means that you created a different number, which is a new chance for us to find a prime number.</p>

This is crucial for us, as this allows us to generate multiple numerised images that we can test for primality.</p>

You begin with a big, bold bet that whatever you’re going to make will cause a revolution. Your product goes through several iterations, entirely transforming throughout the process. You test the strength of a founder's dream.</p><p>Products at this stage are simple, characterized by one 'killer' feature. Often the product doesn't have the chance to fulfill the advertised value and that's okay. The goal at this stage is to validate the appetite of the users: attract them, disappoint them, and leave them hungry for more.</p><p>Product development in this context is chaotic. No roadmap, mostly negative feedback, no clear sense of progress, and definitely no certainty when the next pivot will come. No one knows how the product will look in a month. It's the 'build things that don't scale' phase, taking shortcuts that somewhat work and dealing with most problems later.</p><p>This is where your headlight comes in: product analytics. You use product analytics to drill down what works and what doesn't. Product analytics also tell you if people are actually using your product: you choose a 'North Star' metric that guides your company in the right direction and tells you if your efforts are bearing fruit.</p><p>Then, the company moves on to the next phase. The road ahead becomes clear, product development becomes more linear, and the product itself stabilizes. It's all about doing more of the same thing. You start to build things that scale. It's the beginning of the optimization phase.</p><p>Your roadmap is clearer, traffic grows, the product becomes more and more complex and dynamic. A variety of variables start to influence the way your product performs: marketing, sales, product development, customer success, support, business development, partnerships, promotions, etc.</p><p>You realize all of a sudden the data that helped you find your feet is overwhelming you. You're swimming in data from more and more sources about how your user-base is growing, how people are interacting with your brand and your product. As your data stack grows larger and your dashboards multiply, you start getting the feeling that you’re missing something vital.</p><p>In this fast-growing deluge of data, a missing piece comes into play: product observability. Product observability keeps track of user behavior all the time, at the finest level of granularity to the highest level of abstraction.</p><p>There are many reasons why people change their behavior. Adjustments to the product, holidays, a new offering from a competitor, changing habits, etc. Product observability is capable of spotting those changes and flagging the issue as a problem or, perhaps, an opportunity. Product observability analyzes all your data all the time, noticing the finest-grained changes to overarching trends.</p><p>Product observability is proactive. Product observability informs you that something needs your attention due to a change in user behavior. Or, you learn that what you're doing is working really well and you need to double-down on your efforts. You get details on the origin of the changes and the impact it could have on your business.</p><p>Once you've reached the market with your product, you already know that you're creating value for people. But now the question becomes how much value can you capture? And for how many users? Product observability optimizes your product's ability to create value by automatically giving you feedback on what you need to fix and keep on doing.</p><p>If you’re interested in trying proactive analytics, sign up for Lantern's early access program <a href="https://lantern.so/">here</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to our newsletter</p><div><div><p>Thank you!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Some people are not satisfied with a webcam from their notebook or an old webcam
they bought many years ago.</p>
<p>My brother decided he wants to try streaming. Some people can just do a thing
and other people want to research all the bits and pieces beforehand. Our chat
history is comparable in length to all my other chats combined, so I learned a
lot of it as well. The craft is full with small details and inconveniences.</p>
<p>He found that there are basically no good webcams. A lot of the time an image
quality is meh, and the rare presence of 4k is usually not better than 1080p,
because resolution is not quality. Some camera apparently does upscaling from
1080p to 4k in its driver, indicated by poor quality and high CPU load. He also
has a really good camera, Fujifilm X-T1. It can't be used as a webcam when
connected to a USB port. Usually it's possible to buy an HDMI-to-USB converter,
but his camera can't output a live stream into HDMI, only a recorded video.</p>
<p>So we had an idea — maybe it is possible to create a good webcam
ourselves. Would anybody care? Well, it’s almost 2021 now, streaming is still on
the rise, pandemic is going strong and video meetings are everywhere. People are
willing to spend some money, as indicated by countless videos on YouTube
regarding the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s start with defining what is a good webcam.</p>
<p>A good webcam, in my opinion, is a device that provides a decent sound quality,
at least on par with recent MacBooks, and an image quality on par with top
smartphones, such as iPhone 11/12, Huawei P40 Pro, etc. As smartphones have a
good image quality, then we could probably manufacture a webcam from smartphone
parts that are cheap and easily available. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>If you’ve read at least a couple of articles on the topic of video production,
you will know that to make quality content from the technical standpoint you
need three things, in that particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Video quality</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's discuss these properties and later how to manufacture it.</p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound<a href="#sound" aria-label="Anchor link for: sound">🔗</a></h3>
<p>If you have a recent MacBook, it provides a decent sound quality with its
three-mic array. I haven't researched it and don’t know much about other
notebooks' audio quality. If you have a desktop PC, you have to have some
external mic anyway.</p>
<p>If the web camera has shitty audio quality, you’ll have to buy additional
gear. When I researched the topic, one of the recently released webcams
(available from October 2020) with RRP of $180 was producing a sound as if a
person sits in a big plastic barrel with a closed lid. Their voice was very
muffled with lots of resonant rattles. That level of quality wasn’t acceptable
10 years ago, how this piece of gear could have been produced in 2020 escapes my
understanding.</p>
<p>There are many good enough USB mics for $50+, you also can buy a great XLR
microphone for $100, but then you’ll need an external sound card with phantom
power supply. A decent one can easily cost you $200.</p>
<p>With almost any of these options you’ll have to install and configure some
software that will provide sound level compression, noise suppression (because
your notebook fans are spinning like hell) and won’t produce clicks in the
process.</p>
<p>I would like my webcam to do this by itself, no rattling, minimized echo, etc.</p>
<h3 id="light">Light<a href="#light" aria-label="Anchor link for: light">🔗</a></h3>
<p>A lot of what makes a picture great comes from lighting the scene in a correct way.</p>
<p>The simplest thing is to sit in a room so the window is in front of you and the
Sun isn’t shining into a lens from behind your shoulder.</p>
<p>Webcam cannot provide decent lighting capabilities by itself, so I won’t spend
much time here. There is a <a href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo/RZ19-02320100-R3M1">webcam by
Razer</a>
with a built-in LED circle, but it’s necessarily small, always shines from a
webcam direction and is mostly a gimmick.</p>
<p>We can rely somewhat on the good sensor here. If it provides good dynamic range,
HDR capabilities and good low-light performance, then a patch of sunlight on the
wall won't turn everything else black, or a poorly lit room won't turn into a
gray noisy picture with a bleak silhouette.</p>
<h3 id="image-quality">Image quality<a href="#image-quality" aria-label="Anchor link for: image-quality">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to get a good lens and image sensor into a notebook lid, because
lids are very thin. They’re often something like 4 mm thick all together, and
there is no escaping physics. Of course, it's possible to put a webcam into a
thick part below the lid, but then it'll be useful for expressing anger at our
colleagues with wide-open nostrils and not much else.</p>
<p>Maybe some crazy engineer in the future will develop an array of small sensors
with an array of tiny lenses and somehow combine all that into a good image
quality, but we don't have this tech yet. Any smartphone with a good camera has
that camera with an ugly protruding lens as a thickest part of the phone.</p>
<p>So, if you want something better than a notebook's webcam, you can get some
Logitech webcam with an image quality going back to 2012. It’s still better than
a laptop, but nowhere close to current smartphones.</p>
<p>What if you want better still? The next option is to install an app on the phone
and use it as a webcam. This gives a very good image quality, but it’s very
inconvenient and in some applications doesn’t work at all. For some reason it
isn’t always presented in applications as an option when choosing a video
source.</p>
<p>I don’t want to constantly attach, detach, charge my phone and tune the position of
a small tripod. What’s the next option?</p>
<p>The next option is to just buy a mirrorless photo-camera with a big fat 4/3” or
even APS-C sensor. It will cost $500+ for a new one (you can buy used for
cheaper). You will also need some gear to hold the camera in place, as it won’t
just rest on the top of the screen like a regular webcam. You also need an
HDMI-to-USB video grabber, and you need to be sure that the camera you buy can
output full resolution live onto that HDMI. Also make sure that it's possible to
turn off all on-screen info like <code>1/100s F3.5 ISO 800</code>, which is useful when
you're shooting photos and videos through viewfinder, but not so much when
you're in a video meeting. This feature is called "Clean HDMI".</p>
<p>Of course, you will have a lot of control over the whole stuff — set a
diaphragm, get good bokeh, set ISO, set white balance, etc. Do you actually need
it? Well, some of you do, and a lot of you do not. I learned all that stuff when
I was 16, but now I’m pretty happy with how my phone chooses everything for me
and just does great photos.</p>
<p>All that sounds pretty involved, isn’t it? It is a lot of time to research what
you need, how to set it all up, and a lot of money too.</p>
<h3 id="manufacturing-it">Manufacturing it<a href="#manufacturing-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: manufacturing-it">🔗</a></h3>
<p>So there is a market gap between so-so webcams for $100-200 and a full-blown
setup with a mirrorless camera, an external mic and lighting panels that will
cost almost a grand or two, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>I thought that it is a good idea to create an "upmarket" webcam for $250-300
that will provide good audio and video quality, on par with current smartphones,
actually using the same parts. As smartphones are made in tens of millions, all
relevant parts should be cheap and easily obtainable.</p>
<p>I quickly contacted some people who could help me do the project — firmware
engineer, electric engineer and a company that does mechanical design.</p>
<p>What features are needed for a good webcam for streamers and video meetings?
Audio: good parts (mics and ADC), good mechanical design and assembly (so
nothing would rattle), and some post-processing. We certainly want some
beam-forming capabilities to be able to focus on the person in front of the
webcam, so we will need more than one microphone, maybe up to 4. These parts are
easy to obtain, there are many in stock, it's not a problem.</p>
<p>Even if I think that 4k is not needed, I’m pretty sure it’s really a requirement
to have in an upmarket webcam, as it will be really hard to sell a pricey webcam
that can only do 1080p.</p>
<p>Also would be very nice to have some neural network inference on the chip, so we
can run some AI stuff directly on the webcam without bothering a user’s computer
that can be busy with other things.</p>
<p>I easily found a three-piece assembly for the iPhone 11 Pro for fifty bucks,
two-piece from a Huawei P40 Pro for twenty five and a one-piece from P40 Lite for
ten dollars. That’s with a lens, and bought in retail. Does it mean it costs
peanuts (less than $5 for a sensor) to buy in bulk to produce my own webcam?
Well... Maybe. I can’t just go and buy a couple thousands of these sensors. I’m
pretty sure I can buy a couple thousands of replacement parts for phones, but
sensors themselves are not sold freely. It's easy to buy some "random" sensor
that was around for years and most certainly has "meh" quality by today's
standards, but we need a good one, with good dynamic range, HDR capabilities and
low-light performance.</p>
<p>I wrote to several vendors asking them what are the prices and conditions, and
basically their answer is either silence or “we’ll sell it if you will buy
hundreds of thousands per year”.</p>
<p>I've found suitable System-on-Chips, and it's the same — if we want to have
hardware 4k encoder, it's either "sorry, it was a demo part and we don't do it",
or "we have limited support capabilities, so we can only sell if you will buy
hundreds of thousands, maybe you want some SoMs from our partners?". It is
actually possible to buy System-on-Modules even in very small quantities, but
it's going to be pretty expensive and will be good for a prototype, but for
production it will blow past our budget. System-on-Module will cost almost the
same as the web camera itself.</p>
<p>Oh, and a lead time (from order to shipment) is systematically 16+ weeks. It
means they have no stock and will place an order at semiconductor foundry, have
it produced, packaged and sent to customer. Swiftly.</p>
<p>It means I cannot just build five hundred webcams, see how good are they selling
and build a couple thousand, and so on.</p>
<p>There is also a plastic injection step that requires upfront investment to
manufacture molds, and of course design and engineering costs. All combined it
was tens of thousands …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Using CSS selectors to get elements in end-to-end tests is the most common way (besides xpath), but it can also be tricky and hard to maintain. One day everything could work fine and another a CSS class could be renamed. Styles could change without touching the business flow and then we could have a problem - we'll need to maintain the tests. Of course, the developers could do those changes for us, but they don't know our scenarios, our tests etc. It would be time-consuming for them, because they don't always know if their changes could affect our tests. And for these problems, I think I might have a solution.</p>
<p>But first let's talk about CSS a bit.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-common-problems-with-css-selectors">What are the common problems with CSS selectors?</h2>
<p>Imagine that one day, you had to write a very ugly selector. The element you wanted to use was nested and the only solution available was to base it on CSS classes and HTML structure. And then, a developer made a little refactor that removed some useless HTML tags, which were of course, used in your selector. But he didn't change the business flow. And guess what will happen? Yes, you're right! The test will fail. Your selector will be broken and will need maintenance.</p>
<p>But let's take a step back and think about what are CSS classes designed for? For sure, not to use them in end-to-end tests. Why? Because they're designed to style elements. Everyday there might be changes in the application that don't affect the business flow - which is the most important part in end-to-end tests - but are related with class names changes. That hurts when we need to maintain a test that didn't involve any user flow changes.</p>
<p>Two examples, one simple solution - find better a mechanism to get elements.</p>
<p>What do I recommend? Read below!</p>
<h2 id="use-data-test-id-for-help">Use <code>data-test-id</code> for help!</h2>
<p>For sure, they're controversial but there are two main advantages of using them.</p>
<p>First one is that they're bulletproof. What? I mean, when we use this attribute with an element, no matter if the developer changes the HTML structure or CSS classes, we still get what we want. Unless they remove the element or change the business flow, our test should work fine.</p>
<p>And second, as you may notice, the developer will see that attribute while working with the code. It could help because they can notify us about possible changes or just maintain the tests if needed - using <code>data-test-id</code> makes it easier find occurrences in tests. And if we have more people working on end-to-end tests we can build more reliable solutions. That's what we all want to achieve - always working product:)</p>
<p>More about working closely with developers below:)</p>
<h2 id="but-should-i-use-them-everywhere">But should I use them everywhere?</h2>
<p>Nope. Only with the elements used in tests. We don't want a mess in the code where almost every element has this attribute and only a few of them is used in tests. We want to build trust towards the tests and somehow show the devs that their changes could break our work.</p>
<p>Of course, we'll add some code, but with <code>babel</code> or similar solution we'll get rid of <code>data-test-id</code> on production version. Also, you can take a look at <code>facebook</code> where these attributes are used;).</p>
<p>A little bit of extra work can bring us many benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-using-them">What are the benefits of using them?</h2>
<p>For sure, we can build communication between us and developers. How? Talk. If they see this kind of attribute with an element they want to refactor, they have to maintain the test (in the best case) or just notify us that something could affect it. It's beneficial to know when something can break our tests before running them on testing environment. It'll build trust to the tests. They won't fail because of changes which don't affect the business flow. It will help all of us.</p>
<p>The only thing we need to do is give the developers an opportunity and reason to maintain the tests.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Code structure can always change and it shouldn't affect our tests unless the business flow changes. With selectors based on CSS it could. That's why we decided to go with <code>data-test-id</code> which seems like a reliable solution.</p>
<p>They have some shortcomings but overall I think there is more pros. If you use them you'll work closely with devs which could result in other interesting solutions:) Just remember to add them wisely - only in the elements you're using in tests:)</p>
<p>Have a nice day! 🥳</p></div></div>]]>

            <!-- content --><p>In our Ampere Altra powered Wiwynn Mt. Jade server review, we are going to see why we feel this is the most significant new server of 2020.&nbsp;Wiwynn is far from a household name but it should not be unfamiliar to STH readers. STH got an exclusive tour in Q4 2018 of the company’s headquarters. You can read about that in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/where-cloud-servers-come-from-visiting-wiwynn-in-taipei/">Where Cloud Servers Come From Visiting Wiwynn in Taipei</a>. Although Wiwynn may not be called out in press releases such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/idc-3q20-server-tracker-dell-and-hpe-with-big-share-gain-lenovo-inspur-huawei/">IDC 3Q20 Server Tracker</a> it counts large cloud providers such as Facebook and Microsoft among its customers and has revenue of almost $6B USD per year the last time we checked. Compared to the traditional vendors IDC puts in their press releases, that would put them above Lenovo on hardware sales revenue, but with far fewer employees. Having the Wiwynn Mt. Jade server platform with the Arm-based Ampere Altra is a big deal. Wiwynn’s business model is not to sell low numbers of servers to customers.<span id="more-49470"></span></p>
<p>In this review, we are going to look at the platform, and discuss some of the great features and nuances. We are also going to discuss performance, and then we are going to discuss why this is one of the most important platforms to be released in 2020. Even if you are not interested in Arm servers, this review is going to have some insights that go well beyond just the Altra processor and the server itself.</p>
<h2>Video Version</h2>
<p>As with many of our new pieces, we are going to have a video version of this article as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Most Significant Server of 2020 Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Arm Server" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jESiMLQVNf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a longer video, and has a lot of commentary around the server, and the market impact. As always, we suggest opening a new browser/ tab to watch it as it is a better experience than the embedded player. Also, likes and channel subscriptions are always welcome.</p>
<h2>Ampere Altra Wiwynn Mt. Jade Server Hardware Overview</h2>
<p>With our server reviews going into more detail, we now split our hardware overview into two primary sections. The first is that we look at the exterior of the server to get the basic bits that one servicing the server in a rack would most likely notice. We then get into the internal overview to look at some of the configurability and key features of the server.</p>
<h3>Ampere Altra Wiwynn Mt. Jade Server External Hardware Overview</h3>
<p>Taking a look at the Mt. Jade platform, we can see a fairly typical 2U server layout. This has a single USB port on the left, and a VGA port along with standard power button/ LEDs on the right. The main feature, by far, is storage. There are 24x 2.5″ bays and Wiwynn is leveraging the Ampere Altra platform to deliver one of the most forward-looking designs we have seen to date.</p>

<p>Wiwynn is connecting these 24x drive bays using 6x Amphenol PCIe Gen4 x16 cables. This is not a server designed for SAS/ SATA, instead, the company is leveraging the unique capabilities of the Ampere Altra platform to deliver something decidedly ahead of what many traditional vendors such as Dell, HPE, and Lenovo offer. Here the backplane does not have features such as a SAS expander. Instead, this is a NVMe backplane. One can see the backplanes are held in by thumbscrews, but the impact of Ampere Altra is felt immediately here, this is an all-NVMe design. This design provides Wiwynn the flexibility to swap to a SAS/SATA backplane setup if a customer wishes, but we really like this hardline stance to simplify on a next-generation architecture.</p>

<p>The chassis itself has four of those drive bays (one cable’s worth) that are optionally connected. Although the cable is connected via the backplane here, the other end can be used in a PCIe Gen4 x16 header that can instead provide PCIe connectivity to rear risers. Ampere Altra has many PCIe lanes, but there are limits. Still, Wiwynn’s forward-looking design is moving beyond the limitations of PCB and has configurability on where PCIe lanes are directed. We will see more of this type of design in the PCIe Gen4 era but it will become increasingly commonplace as we move to PCIe Gen5 and beyond. Effectively, with Ampere Altra is providing Wiwynn with a platform that is already incorporating these design principles.</p>
<p>On the rear of the server, we see a fairly standard layout. The rear I/O consists of a VGA port, a management LAN port, a serial port, and two USB 3 ports. There are three blocks for I/O risers, two are full-height and one is low-profile. One can also see an OCP NIC 3.0 slot in the middle of the platform.</p>

<p>The 2kW power supplies seem a bit large for the relatively lower power consumption of the Ampere Arm server chips. The 80Plus Platinum units are likely larger than a normal server of this class simply as this is also a development platform. As a result, people tend to plug a multitude of devices into this type of server. That can include many high-power NVMe SSDs up front, or even accelerators in the rear. We tried the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-t4-ai-inferencing-gpu-review/">NVIDIA T4</a> and it worked in this platform.</p>

<p>Part of the purpose of this piece is to show how similar the server is to a modern x86 server since that is a big question when organizations are looking to add Arm into their data centers.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to look at the internals of the server before proceeding with the remainder of our review.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/21/a-to-do-app-that-fits-in-a-single-tweet/">post</a> was an awesome one, I learned a lot in JavaScript and and I was happy to see people doing what I thought impossible. Writing a simple todo app within 280 chars, in plain js.</p>
<p>After I finished writing the post, I wanted to share it on Reddit JavaScript community, r/javascript at the same time I shared it on HackerNews.</p>
<p>I have seen lot of comments on HackerNews criticizing the new Reddit design, using JavaScript and breaking in their mobile website, and constant nags pushing the users to their mobile app.</p>
<p>I was one of those few who liked their new design on desktop, no page loads between posting something, lot of white spaces, I feel most of the average users would be feeling the same, except for the tech community. But as a service Reddit should be looking at the common denominator, not the outliers.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed with the mobile app nag, when I visit the mobile website, Reddit is always asking me to download the mobile app. But I just cancel it and move along in the mobile browser.</p>
<p>But what happened yesterday just took me off the ledge. When I visited the r/javascript community on my iPad, I was greeted with this screen.</p>

<p>Why do you block me from from visiting the community from my mobile device?</p>
<p>Will the whole mobile website is scrapped and you end up with a landing page to download the mobile app?</p>
<p><strong>If you want to visit a popular subreddit</strong>, <strong>install our up and use it, or else login. </strong></p>
<p>I’ve managed to see the subreddit by requesting the desktop website, but I’m sure they will figure out a way, by checking the screen size to block this as well.</p>
<p>I understand that, as a company, you need to push to gain as much users as possible on their mobile devices, that’s the best way to track, to send notifications and keep you hooked and keep coming back. If I had a company like Reddit I might have done the same.</p>
<p>But for blocking users from their mobile devices, a service they once offered is a very dark pattern, instead what they should do is introduce some awesome features that will make the users download the app by themselves so they can enjoy those features. Not forcing the app though their throats.</p>
<p>Anyone else experienced a similar experience on Reddit mobile?</p>
<p><em>Only after writing the and checking the screenshot again made me see that they allow you to see the subreddit by logging in. But that is obscured and they intend to push users to download the app.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="Is Your Career Drifting Out To Sea?">Is Your Career Drifting Out To Sea?</h2><p>Like a frog who's slowly being boiled in a pot but doesn't realise it, two years into my career I slowly came to discover that I wasn't progressing anywhere near what I thought I should have.</p><p>I was learning tons and growing in my skills. But it seemed like that didn't matter.</p><p>Failed job interviews, tiny salary increases after delivering on difficult long-term projects, bitterness, etc. were the results.</p><p><b>Have you ever felt the same way as I did? Feel like your quality of work and effort doesn't get the recognition and results you expected?</b></p><p>One year, I was flat-out told that I wouldn't be getting a raise because I had spent some time on parental leave (even though I had delivered on a critical project that year).</p><p>Another time, I failed a job interview due to my poor attitude and bitterness towards a situation which in reality was a very complex project that needed strong ownership, patience and leadership.</p><h2 id="I took ownership of my career">I took ownership of my career</h2><p>Faced with the reality of career progression as a software developer, I decided to make an intentional effort to take ownership of my career.</p><p>What does that mean, you ask?</p><blockquote><p><b>Taking ownership of your career means that you realise your career is an organic thing that you can either nurture and grow, ignore or even damage.</b></p></blockquote><p>It's like a garden: deciding what seeds to plant, where to plant, how to nurture your plants, deciding what plants to sow more of, etc.</p><p>If you are intentional about planting and maintaining your garden then you should get results.</p><p>If you don't maintain your plants then your garden will most likely get grown over with weeds and not do so well!</p><p>And, if you don't plant any seeds yet expect a garden to appear - well, that's kinda crazy.</p><p>Your career is the same! If you simply expect that "doing a good job" will land you promotions or position you as a competitive asset in the job market then it's just like that last analogy of ignoring your garden!</p><h2 id="Does doing good work mean getting recognised?"><b>Does doing good work mean getting recognised?</b></h2><p>For myself, the root falsehood I believed was that <i>doing good work would lead to being recognised.</i></p><p>Sadly, most of the time, that's just not true.</p><p>Our managers are overloaded with their tasks. They are juggling personal issues, internal HR conflicts, overdue projects, etc.</p><p>Is "just doing a good job" going to make you stand-out in their minds? <i>Nope.</i></p><p>This is the biggest piece of advice I give everyone who comes to me with career advice:</p><p><b>You need to simply stand-out.</b></p><p>Whether that's within your company, among other resumes, within the greater developer community, etc.</p><h2 id="Reputation"><b>Reputation</b></h2><h3><b>What is it?</b></h3><p>Reputation just means "how much you stand-out" combined with your overall professional competence.</p><p>Reputation = How much you stand-out + competence.</p><p>Think of your programming "heroes": they are very skilled and competent. <i>Yet</i>, they are constantly putting themselves in public by promoting themselves, sharing their thoughts, sharing their "wins", etc.</p><p>Do you think they have trouble landing new jobs? <i>Nope.</i></p><p>Does that mean you need to become a programming hero to get promoted and land that new job? Not at all.</p><blockquote><p>I'm simply pointing out that self-promotion, helping other people, getting involved in communities, networking with other professionals and building long-lasting relationships are all part of building your reputation.</p></blockquote><p>If you are always helping your manager, discussing your "wins" and asking about how your work has affected the company then you'll ensure that you're top of mind.</p><p>The fact is, most developers hardly talk to their managers about their work and how it's impacting the company.</p><p>Tip: Show an interest in your manager. Make their job easier by doing awesome work. And, ask about how your work is improving the company. <i>One-on-one meetings are a great time to ask about these things.</i></p><h2 id="Questions that others ask about YOU"><b>Questions that others ask about YOU</b></h2><p>Everyone is forming an opinion and view of who you are, how skilled you are, etc.</p><p>Here's a short list to get you thinking about what others are asking themselves about <b>YOU</b>:</p><ul><li><p>Are they kind?</p></li><li><p>Helpful?</p></li><li><p>Intelligent?</p></li><li><p>Do good work?</p></li><li><p>Produce results?</p></li><li><p>Learns quickly?</p></li><li><p>Good at mentoring and teaching others?</p></li></ul><p>Make sure that you can "check" all of those off!</p><p>If you are always complaining and have a poor attitude, then your peers will not see you in a good light.</p><p>On the other hand, if you aren't learning and growing then your peers will see you like a stagnant resource that will, over time, drag down the team!</p><h2 id="Navigating the stages of your career">Navigating the stages of your career</h2><p>Before looking at the specifics of how you can start to grow your reputation and grow in your career, you should get an idea of what general career stage you are at.</p><p>I use a simple framework to layout the common career path stages that most software developers will find themselves in.</p><p>The stages are:</p><ul><li><p>Coder</p></li><li><p>Junior Developer</p></li><li><p>Intermediate Developer</p></li><li><p>Senior Developer</p></li><li><p>Lead Developer</p></li><li><p>Tech Leader</p></li></ul><p>These stages are <b>not job titles.</b> They represent a developer's real experience and competence.</p><p>It's been said that someone with 10 years experience might, in practice, have repeated the same 1 year of experience over-and-over!</p><p>Let's take a look at these stages to get an idea of where you fit and where you might want to go in the future.</p><h3>Coder</h3><p>A coder is a hobbyist.</p><p>If you don't get paid professionally or work with a team of other developers, then you might be a coder.</p><h3>Junior developer</h3><p>A junior developer is entering the IT field as a paid professional and they work with a team of other professionals.</p><p>Are you a junior developer?</p><p>If you've been a professional developer for less than a year (as a very general figure) then you're probably a junior.</p><p>Take a look at the next stage to see if it resonates. If not, then you might still be a junior who's transitioning into becoming an intermediate developer.</p><h3>Intermediate developer</h3><p>An intermediate developer is a competent team member and contributor.</p><p>The telling sign I use for this stage is that <b>intermediate developers usually have a mental urge or "pull" to believe that they know everything they need to know.</b></p><p>Perhaps they feel like their views on how to best architect a system are "complete."</p><p>Perhaps they feel like Javascript is the only programming language they ever need and ever want.</p><p>Whatever it is, there is some degree of feeling like they've "found" the silver bullet or that their current view is finally "the one."</p><blockquote><p><b>The intermediate stage is like stepping into puberty for your career.</b></p></blockquote><p>For example, teens tend to begin believing that they know better than their parents.</p><p>They tend to experiment and be bold about what they believe.</p><p>They begin to tread a path of their own.</p><p>This is the intermediate developer. They are starting to think for themselves.</p><h3>Senior developer</h3><p>The senior developer is becoming very skilled and knowledgeable to the point that those around them are looking to them as a mentor and a "go-to".</p><p>They usually have some specialised or advanced programming knowledge and can build more complex systems using advanced techniques and patterns.</p><p>Seniors are confident in what they know due to their experiences. But they also have a grasp on the fact that there's <i>so much they don't know about.</i></p><p>The biggest telling sign that you are in this stage is whether or not your peers are constantly coming to you for advice and guidance. Are you mentoring others too? These are all signs of being a senior developer.</p><h3>Lead developer</h3><p>The lead developer is focused on providing high-level guidance to their dev team.</p><p>But more importantly, they are a bridge or connector between the development team and the other business-oriented departments in your organisation.</p><p>Are you leading a team of developers? Do you also have to communicate with non-technical managers or other departments about what the development team is working on, etc? If so, you're a lead developer.</p><h3>Tech Leader</h3><p>I hesitate to include this one, but I think it's helpful to see where your career could go in the future.</p><p>A tech leader has made a name for themselves as an expert in some specific area(s) and usually have a very targeted branding/positioning as to what they do well.</p><p>That might be a specific programming language, web security, front-end development with react, a developer mentor, or even a particular industry.</p><p>They could be community builders who have a following of people that look up to them as a direct or indirect mentor.</p><p>They could be thought leaders who champion some specific cause or idea.</p><p>They usually speak publicly about their area of expertise or the ideas that they champion.</p><p>In a nutshell, they are technology experts and very skilled communicators.</p><p>If that sounds like you, then you might be a tech leader.</p><h2 id="How to get to the next stage">How to get to the next stage</h2><p>I've written elsewhere about specific tips to move between each career step. For the moment, I want to highlight some more general pieces of advice that anyone can leverage and use to move forward.</p><h3>Stand-out</h3><p>You need to stand-out within your company if you want to land promotions and be a part of important and growth-inducing projects.</p><p><b>Find a gap within your team or company that could help solve some important problems your company is facing.</b></p><p>Practically speaking, if you are early in your career, just keep an eye out for whenever your peers seem surprised at some skill or way of doing things you have. This might indicate a gap that could be helpful to your organisation!</p><figure><img alt="Tulip standing out" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/21BebbVbTAiiI20dza4oac/a4a8fcfd76d42b38da278dc8a9f8449d/rupert-britton-l37N7a1lL6w-unsplash.jpg"><figcaption>Photo by Rupert Britton on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>For example, if you did something fancy with CSS that other developers notice and are impressed with, then that could indicate a gap.</p><p>For more seasoned developers, it should be more apparent what gaps need to be filled. And, the more experienced you are, the more you should naturally drift into a position of mentoring others and having a clear picture of what gaps need to be filled.</p><p>Once you are seasoned, you can use this principle and apply it to the global community - not just your internal company. Try to figure out where there is a need or where certain trends seem to be pointing.</p><p>The specific gap you fill doesn't matter so much. The point is that <b>you need to stand-out as a competent problem-solver who …</b></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607775961422/elXIChWIZ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into Horcruxing, here's a quick prologue on online security hygiene. You can skip to the  <a href="#double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Horcruxing section</a>  if it seems redundant.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-strong-online-security">Rules for Strong Online Security</h3>
<p>1.
<strong>Longer passwords (atleast 16 characters) are better than shorter ones</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; cutesamantha15101995 &gt; cutesamantha
</code></pre><p>2.
<strong>Randomized passwords are better than personally identifiable passwords</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; process-cancel-stingy-garnet &gt; cutesamantha15101995
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: </strong> <code>process-cancel-stingy-garnet</code> is technically a passphrase - basically an easy-to-remember password in comparison to randomized strings like <code>B6fSpxMj&amp;f6DU@5^k</code></p>
<p>3.
<strong>Have a <em>significantly</em> different password for each account</strong></p>
<p>Having the same password for different accounts is like using the same key for different locks. It beats the whole point of having multiple locks! Also, having different passwords but with only one easily guessable word different (like the ones below) still poses the same risk. The passwords should be <strong><em>significantly</em></strong> different.</p>
<pre><code>bounce-unfold-stunning-chute        process-cancel-stingy-facebook
symptom-untouched-unpaid-arena  &gt;   process-cancel-stingy-twitter
sediment-tweak-annually-koala       process-cancel-stingy-gmail
</code></pre><p>4.
<strong>Use 2FA/MFA wherever possible</strong></p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook offer a 2FA feature where you need the second factor only when you login from a new device or a new location, instead of needing 2FA every time. That's a rare combination of convenience &amp; security right there! 
Most other sites also offer some variation of 2FA.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use the  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp">andOTP</a>  (or any other) app's TOTP as the second factor since it cannot be spoofed or spied on lock-screen like the SMS OTP and does not require a mobile network or internet connection. You can also use Biometrics (finger print or face recognition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! How do I create a long password for each of the bazillion websites out there, <em>and</em> have them significantly different <em>and</em> remember them? Security seems like such a pain in the ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="enter-password-manager">[enter] <strong>PASSWORD MANAGER</strong></h3>
<p>A password manager helps you manage all your passwords in one place, either in the form of a browser extension, mobile app, or website. Good password managers will offer a browser extension and a mobile app with one-click auto-fill-login-page feature by removing the hassle of copy pasting or typing your login details. A few smart ones even detect phishing pages and warn you indirectly, by not showing the login details for such web pages.</p>
<p>They enable all the above measures for strong online security with ease. While I agree it takes some effort to set it up for the very first time. But, after that, it just flows like butter. </p>
<p><br>
For example, password generator in <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> lets you custom design your random password in different flavours.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770748804/m93T3kqUH.png?auto=compress" alt="BitWarden's password generator"></p>
<h3 id="yay-im-secure">YAY! I'm Secure!</h3>
<p>You meticulously move all your passwords and secrets to a trusted password manager. Finally, you can rest easy knowing that your digital life is truly secure. Or, is it?  <br></p>
<p><strong>What if </strong></p><ul>
<li>your master password (the password to your password manager) is compromised due to a security breach or you left it in plaintext on a post-it/ email/ notes app</li>
<li>someone gained temporary access to your unlocked system (computer or phone) when you stepped away to get that last coffee for the day and your password manager is still logged in for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer: you're <strong><em>screwed</em></strong>. The cost of putting all your eggs in one basket is that it could all go into oblivion in one fell swoop. How do you overcome this challenge now? </p>
<h3 id="double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Double Blind Passwords (aka Horcruxing)</h3>
<p>For all his faults, Voldemort did one good thing for us muggles. He gave us the concept of a horcrux. For the uninitiated, a horcrux is any object in which you store a piece of your soul, putting the proverbial eggs of your soul into different baskets, to gain quasi-immortality. </p>
<p><strong>The basic idea</strong>: You split your password into 2 parts - one which is stored in the password manager, and the other which is stored in your head (aka horcrux).</p>
<p>Basically, at any given point in time, you and your password manager know only a piece of the password. It's double-blind. In effect, just like You-Know-Who, you're splitting your password (soul) into pieces and storing them in different places.</p>
<h4 id="before">BEFORE</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="after">AFTER</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venus</span>


<span>horcrux: papel</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venuspapel</span>
</code></pre><p>The horcrux adds an additional layer of security that only you can unlock. It's a kind of 2FA. Again, the longer the horcrux the better. But, a simple word should also be fine as long as only you know the horcrux.</p>
<p>If it feels like too much effort, use a horcrux only for the most important logins - your social media, bank accounts etc. </p>
<h3 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<p>Security is never absolute. One can try to secure a system as tightly as possible, but never really say that it is fully secure (if you see someone claiming otherwise, it's mostly marketing bullshit). If we cannot make systems completely secure, the next best thing to do is to make them as secure as possible and a good way to do it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing">Defense In Depth</a> - basically make sure that even if one layer of security is breached, there exist other layers to mitigate further damage - which is what we've tried to achieve all along.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>1.
Use a good password manager </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use BitWarden (since it is open source and costs just $10 a year for the PRO features)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.
Use TOTP/ biometrics instead of SMS-based OTP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use andOTP (since it is open source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.
Use a horcrux (a double-blind password) for the most important logins</p>

<p>P.S. Keep in mind that horcruxing only works fine until you connect your brain to NeuraLink and accidentally upload your thoughts online for everyone to see. :P</p>

The GAFES<em> </em>were formed in 1986 as an elite quick reaction force specializing in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare. When the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, the GAFES received combat experience in the brutal fight with the leftist <em>EjÃ©rcito Zapatista de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional</em> (EZLN) in Chiapas. According to <a href="http://historic.edualter.org/material/ddhh/proc1.htm">reporting by Carlos Marin</a>, the army sent the GAFES to Chiapas to <strong>create paramilitaries and displace the population</strong> in order to break the support of the people for the EZLN, an approach which would be used against organized crime years later. In Ioan Grillo's book <em>El Narco</em>, he describes how the mutilated bodies of rebels captured by the GAFES were dumped along a riverbank in the Las Margaritas municipality with their ears and noses sliced off, the sort of spectacular violence that <em>Los Zetas</em> would later standardize in the Drug War.</p><figure><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-26-at-5.09.07-PM-1.png"><figcaption>2005 FBI memo about <em>Los Zetas</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the original members of <em>Los Zetas</em> are said to have been <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB499/DOCUMENT01-20050422.PDF">trained by the U.S.</a> at the notorious School of the Americas, although accounts vary about exactly who, where and when. Some say it was at <a href="https://www.kold.com/story/3394374/los-zetas-draw-concern-of-us-government/">Ft.

According to Lt. Col. Craig Deare (retired), the former Academic Dean at the intellectual center of gravity of U.S. defense policy in Latin America since 1997, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS), it was likely that more than 500 Mexican GAFES received training from U.S. special operations forces (SOF).</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2010/11/03/us-trained-cartel-terrorises-mexico/">reporting</a> in Al Jazeera:</p><p><em>Some of the cartelâ€™s initial members were elite Mexican troops, trained in the early 1990s by Americaâ€™s 7th Special Forces Group or â€œsnake eatersâ€� at Ft.

During the Reagan administration in the 1980s, the 7th SFG trained, supported and fought with some of the most brutal and repressive special operations and unconventional forces in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela.</p><figure><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-2.45.27-PM.png"><figcaption>A U.S. special forces Soldier assigned to 7th SF Group, oversees a group of Guatemalan Special Forces "Kaibils" conduct pistol marksmanship training Jan. 28 in Poptun, Guatemala (<a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/image/1749645/kaibil-us-special-forces-promote-security-through-partnership">DVIDS</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Between 1996 and 1999, <a href="https://www.jornada.com.mx/1998/08/16/mexico.html">3,200 soldiers</a>, including at least 500 GAFES, were reportedly trained by the 7th SFG in the U.S. to create elite "counternarcotics" forces for fighting on behalf of the post-Cold War U.S. national security agenda.</p><p>Conveniently framed as an ironic consequence of the corrupting influence of the cartels, the training from the U.S. special forces diffused into the service of one of Mexico's oldest drug trafficking organizations. In 1997, the same year that the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies was founded, Arturo GuzmÃ¡n Decena, a GAFE later known by the alias "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Guzm%C3%A1n_Decena">El Zeta-uno</a>", supposedly defected along with other elite Mexican soldiers to work for the Gulf cartel in Tamaulipas.

The Kaibiles and other Guatemalan security forces were trained by the U.S. in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare before, during and after Guatemala's 36-year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/guatemalan-army-waged-genocide-new-report-finds.html">genocide</a>.

According to <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Bay-Area-protesters-sentenced-in-Georgia-Jail-2796779.php">testimony</a> from Major Joseph Blair, a former instructor at the school, the changes were only superficial and an identical curriculum was taught from the exact same instruction manuals. Between 1999 and 2010, <a href="http://www.ghrc-usa.org/Publications/factsheet_kaibiles.pdf">3,555 Guatemalan soldiers</a>, many of them Kaibiles, were trained by the U.S. through WHINSEC and other programs.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-2.58.27-PM.png" width="1256" height="712"></p><p><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-10.11.53-AM.png" width="1462" height="944"></p><p><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-10.11.36-AM.png" width="1462" height="944"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/guatemalan-army-waged-genocide-new-report-finds.html">New York Times</a>; <a href="https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/s3fs-public/mos_en.pdf">CEH</a>;</figcaption></figure><p>The Kaibiles are taught to kill without mercy or thought.

Like the "snake eaters" of the U.S. 7th SFG, the Kaibiles kill to eat and live to kill. Their motto is: "<em>Si avanzo, sÃ­gueme. Si me detengo, aprÃ©miame.

The smallest children were killed by smashing their heads against trees and the sides of buildings, while older children were killed with a hammer. Adults were interrogated and tortured, one by one, and the women were raped by the Kaibiles. The Kaibiles also cut fetuses out of pregnant women. After the interrogation, the adults were also killed with a hammer and the corpses were dumped in a well. A few years after the massacre, one of the Kaibil officers who had supervised the atrocity, Pedro Pimental Rios, became an instructor at the School of the Americas. He was extradited from the U.S. in 2012 and sentenced to more than 6,000 years in prison for his involvement.</p><p>According to a declassified <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB32/docs/doc42.pdf">Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) memo</a> from 1994, intelligence sources described clandestine graves outside of a Guatemalan military facility. The memo described Guatemalan soldiers flying captives over the ocean before pushing them out of helicopters to their deaths, a technique also used in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/world/argentine-tells-of-dumping-dirty-war-captives-into-sea.html">Argentina</a>.

A <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a475840.pdf">2007 academic paper</a> outlined a new <strong>distributed operational model</strong> for command and control (C2) for Special Operations Command in the U.S. SOUTHCOM AOR based on the approach of the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). The authors recognized the USMC approach as, "better suited for counterinsurgency and non-combat environments, where the objectives are more ambivalent." According to the authors:</p><p><em>In standard military maneuver operations where missions such as â€œattack that position,â€� are clearly defined, the [conventional] definition of C2 is sufficient. However, in an ambiguous environment where SOF often operates, the mission (e.g., plan and execute UW [Unconventional Warfare]) is not as clearly defined. As a result, a special operator in the field must be able to operate with maximum authority, flexibility, and agility to respond to immediate changes emerging from dynamic situations. The USMC definition reflects precisely how SOCSOUTHâ€™s staff currently approaches C2 in its theater of operations.</em></p><p>Officers from the Colombian military studying at the <strong>United State Marine Corps Command and Staff College</strong> at the Marine Corps University quickly recognized the advantages of the U.S. approach.

<p>The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is very impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2">CineBench benchmarks</a>.
These scores were 1.6x higher than I got on my old Haswell desktop and 2x
higher than my new Tiger Lake laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">ray tracing API for Metal</a>
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX GPU ray tracing APIs.
So, I decided to pick up a Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive path tracing project,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>,
and to get it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we’ll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
then we’ll make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing
performance comparisons against the M1.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a> is an open source
interactive path tracer that I’ve been working on to learn the different ray tracing APIs,
and to provide an example or starting point for myself and others working with them
in other projects.
ChameleonRT provides backends for the GPU ray tracing APIs:
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/dxr">DirectX Ray Tracing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/vulkan">Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/optix">OptiX 7</a>.
Through the work discussed in this post, it also has a new
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/metal">Metal</a> GPU backend.
ChameleonRT also has an <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/embree">Embree backend</a>
for fast multi-threaded and SIMD accelerated ray tracing on CPUs through
<a href="https://www.embree.org/">Embree</a>, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">TBB</a>.
The rendering code in each backend is nearly identical and they produce almost pixel exact outputs,
with some possible small differences due to subtle differences in the ray tracing
libraries or shader languages.</p>

<p>ChameleonRT is different from popular ray tracing benchmark applications like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">CineBench</a>, <a href="http://www.luxmark.info/">LuxMark</a>,
and <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Benchmark</a>, in that ChameleonRT is
a minimal interactive path tracer. CineBench, LuxMark, and Blender Benchmark are excellent
for getting a full picture of what performance to expect from a production film
renderer, as they are production renderers. However, there’s a lot more going
on in a production renderer than just ray tracing to support the kind of complex
geometries, materials, and effects used in film; and the large code
bases can be challenging to quickly port to a new architecture or API.
ChameleonRT is the exact opposite, supporting just one geometry type,
triangle meshes, and one material type, the Disney BRDF.
The rest of the code is similarly written to achieve interactive path tracing performance,
though I have tried to balance this with how complex the code is to read.
For example, the renderers use iterative ray tracing instead of recursion,
support only a simple sampling strategy, and don’t support alpha cut-out effects.
The use of iterative ray tracing is valuable on both the CPU and GPU, but is
especially important on the GPU, as the
overhead of recursive ray tracing calls in the pipeline can have a significant performance impact.
Similarly, ignoring alpha cut-out effects allows the GPU renderers
to skip using an any hit shader (and the Embree on to skip needing an intersection
filter). The any hit shader (or intersection filter) would be called during
BVH traversal after a candidate intersection with a triangle is found.
In the case that the BVH traversal is hardware accelerated, this ends up
producing a lot amount of back and
forth between the fixed function traversal hardware and the shader cores to run the any hit
shader during traversal, limiting the hardware’s performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a path tracer? Path tracing is a technique in computer graphics for
rendering photo-realistic images by simulating the light transport in
the scene. It is a Monte Carlo technique, meaning that it randomly samples
light paths emitted from lights in the scene that reach the camera
by bouncing off objects in the scene. This is done by tracing the paths in reverse,
starting from the camera and tracing the path back through the scene.
A large number of light paths need to be sampled to produce a noise-free
image. Path tracing is not restricted to photo-realism, and is the
core rendering algorithm used in major film renderers, such as: Pixar’s Renderman,
Disney’s Hyperion, Autodesk’s Arnold, and Weta’s Manuka.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">Wikipedia</a> for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new ray tracing API in Metal will be familiar to those who’ve used inline ray
tracing in DirectX or Vulkan. For a good introduction to Metal’s API, check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">Discover ray tracing
with Metal</a> video from WWDC 2020,
and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal?language=objc">accompanying sample</a>.
Inline ray tracing allows applications to make ray tracing calls in any shader stage,
e.g., fragment/pixel shaders, vertex shaders, compute shaders, etc.
Inline ray tracing allows ray tracing effects, for example accurate reflections and shadows,
to be integrated into the regular rasterization pipeline.
Inline ray tracing can also be used from a compute shader to implement a standalone
path tracing based renderer. ChameleonRT is a standalone path tracer, and takes
the compute shader approach for Metal.</p>

<p>At a high-level, ray tracing in Metal proceeds as follows: you upload your
geometry data, build bottom-level primitive acceleration structures over them, then create instances
referencing those acceleration structures and build a top-level acceleration structure over
the instances.
To render the scene you dispatch a compute shader and trace rays against the top-level
acceleration structure to get back intersection results. The intersection results provide
you with the intersected primitive and geometry IDs, and if using instancing, the instance ID.
Your shader can then look up the geometry data for the object that was hit and shade it,
after which it can continue tracing the path.</p>

<p>At this time Metal only supports inline ray tracing, in contrast to DirectX and Vulkan, which
also provide support for ray tracing pipelines. Ray tracing pipelines are used
to implement standalone ray tracing renderers, and is the approach ChameleonRT
uses in its DirectX and Vulkan backends.
OptiX only supports ray tracing pipelines.
Ray tracing pipelines require the creation of a Shader Binding Table to
provide the API with a table of functions to call when specific objects
in the scene are intersected. The SBT can be difficult to setup and debug,
and is a common point of difficulty for developers learning these APIs.
For more information about the SBT, check out my post
<a href="https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways">“The RTX Shader Binding Table Three Ways”</a>.
However, the potential benefit of the SBT is that the GPU can reorder or group function
calls to reduce thread divergence. With inline ray tracing, the developer
must do this themselves, or do without
(check out another video from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10013/">WWDC20</a>
for information here).
Right now, ChameleonRT does not do any reordering to reduce divergence.</p>

<p>Those familiar with Metal may know of the previous
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing?language=objc">Metal Performance Shaders ray intersector</a>.
The new support for inline ray tracing improves on this by allowing the renderer
to move entirely to the GPU. The previous ray intersector worked by taking
batches of rays, finding intersections in the scene, and writing these results
back out to memory. Multiple compute shaders would need to be dispatched to
trace the primary rays and create shadow and secondary rays, then trace the shadow rays
and continue the secondary rays while filtering out paths that terminated.
This requires significantly more memory traffic and compute dispatches, introducing overhead
to the renderer. Such an approach is also not well suited to augmenting traditional
rasterization pipelines with ray tracing effects.
Approaches based on tracing and sorting rays and intersection information to extract
coherence are valuable for complex film renderers, and can be implemented efficiently using inline
ray tracing as well.
For example, <a href="https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/hyperiondesign.html">Disney’s Hyperion renderer</a>
uses sorting and batching extensively to
extract coherent workloads from an otherwise incoherent and divergent distribution of rays.
There’s also an excellent higher-level <a href="https://youtu.be/frLwRLS_ZR0">video</a> explaining how this
works.</p>

<p>The Metal ray tracing API is quite nice to work with.
It bears a lot of similarity to the other ray tracing APIs, but has been streamlined
to be easier to use.
For example, compare the code required to build and compact a BVH in
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/dxr/dxr_utils.cpp#L877-L977">DirectX</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/vulkan/vulkanrt_utils.cpp#L46-L214">Vulkan</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/metal/metalrt_utils.mm#L318-L396">Metal</a>.
OptiX’s API provides a similar simplification, here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/optix/optix_utils.cpp#L183-L244">BVH build in OptiX</a>
for reference.
It’s also nice to have templates and C++ style functionality in the shader language,
a feature Metal shares with OptiX, which uses CUDA for the device side code.</p>

<p>This simplicity also has some drawbacks. For example, while in DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
you have control over where the acceleration structure memory is allocated,
Metal makes this allocation for you. As a result, you cannot allocate the acceleration
structures on a <code>MTLHeap</code>, and so to make sure they’re available for your rendering
pipeline, you must individually mark them as used in a loop instead of a single <code>useHeap</code> call.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span></span><span>// Use our top level acceleration structure</span>
<span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>setAccelerationStructure</span><span>:</span><span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>atBufferIndex</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>// Also mark all mesh acceleration structures used, as they're indirectly</span>
<span>// referenced by the top level one</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mesh</span> <span>:</span> <span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>meshes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>useResource</span><span>:</span><span>mesh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>usage</span><span>:</span><span>MTLResourceUsageRead</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This can add some overhead if you have a lot of bottom level BVHs, as can be the
case in scenes with many instances.
It’d be nice to be able to allocate the acceleration structures on a heap, and replace this loop
with a single <code>[command_encoder useHeap:data_heap-&gt;heap];</code></p>

<p>The API is also simplified significantly by not including ray tracing pipelines and
only requiring a Shader Binding Table-esque
structure when implementing custom geometries or other operations that need
to happen …</p></div></div></div>

      The classic book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BASIC-Computer-Games-Microcomputer-David/dp/0894800523">
      <em>BASIC Computer Games</em></a>,
      published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing">Creative Computing</a>,
      inspired a generation of programmers.  The games were written by many people, and compiled by
      <a href="http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Ahl/DHAbio.htm">David H. Ahl</a>. The fabulous illustrations
      accompanying each game were done by
      <a href="http://www.bekerbots.com/">George Beker</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure.
      I've tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they'll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see
      a few oddities. That's part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines.
      The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter
      input.

      The table below includes both links to the pages of the book at
      <a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/">atariarchives.org</a>,
      and the source code for each game.  I obtained most of the source code from
      <a href="http://www.classicbasicgames.org/">classicbasicgames.org</a>, with the exception
      of Civil War and Super Star Trek, which I entered myself.  The descriptions mainly come

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_new_model_m.png"><p>Unicomp new Model M keyboard is the latest version of the classic and fabulous IBM Model M keyboard that came out earlier this year. This blog post is my unboxing and review of this timeless keyboard.</p><p>My favorite keyboard of all time was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM Model M keyboard</a>. Through out the 1980s and the 1990s I would exclusively use this keyboard. In fact as I type this blog post I can confirm I still have 3 of them in my garage back in London, England.</p><p>Ever since I moved to the USA, both at work and at home I have been using various keyboards by Apple. Though I have nothing bad to say about the Apple keyboards, after all they are cosmetically pleasing, of high build quality and work really well with all things Apple, I started really missing my IBM Model M. This is when I found out Unicomp have released a new Model M and I decided to buy one.</p><h2 id="who-are-unicomp">Who are Unicomp?</h2><p>When IBM decided to stop manufacturing keyboards, a company called Lexmark bought their equipment and all rights to their keyboards and continued making them. In turn Lexmark stopped manufacturing keyboards too and at that point some ex-IBM and ex-Lexmark staff got together, purchased all the manufacturing equipment and rights to continue manufacturing the keyboards (but of course without the IBM and Lexmark branding) and setup a new company called <code>Unicomp</code>. <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/">Unicomp</a> has since continued producing these keyboards for like the last 25 years.</p><h2 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h2><p>This is how it was delivered:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M box"></p><p>When the package arrived I could feel the keyboard moving inside the box, but when I opened the box I saw how well it was packed:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_open_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M opened box"></p><p>I took it out of its box and removed all packaging material it was wrapped in:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_out_of_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M Keyboard"></p><h2 id="review">Review</h2><p>As I looked at the keyboard, before taking it out of the box, I could immediately tell it was a Model M and its evolution. Super excited and impatient I took it out of the box. My first observation was that it comes with a USB (standard not USB-C) cable that is not removable. It felt lighter in weight than the original IBM Model M I had. Next I looked at its build quality and was overall impressed. The original IBM Model M does feel more robust but I could not fault this new Model M. All this was to be expected though, as I didn’t have my expectation set to receiving a keyboard that is made by 100% the same materials as the original Model M I had.</p><p>Having one of the newer macbooks with only USB-C ports, I set my new keyboard on my desk and plugged it in via a USB adapter and off I went looking for excuses to type so I can use my new keyboard.</p><p>I am thoroughly enjoying using this keyboard. Its typing feel and size are on par with the original Model M I had. I had forgotten how much more comfortable it is to type on Model M than an Apple keyboard. Comparing now, I can see that my hands are too big for the Apple keyboards so I would try to type in a cramped space to fit my hands in, as opposed to this Model M which is perfect for my hand size. This alone has resulted in me being able type faster, be more comfortable and make virtually no typing mistakes. As always I find the higher actuation point feel and the audible feedback the sound provided by the buckling springs with each keystroke incredibly pleasing. Comparing the sound of the buckling springs with the original IBM Model M, I would say the new Unicomp Model M is slightly quieter.</p><h3 id="how-well-does-it-work-with-macos">How well does it work with macOS</h3><p>When I went to place my order on Unicomp website they only had a windows version of the new Model M listed. Whilst that will work fine with macOS, it does have some features missing compared to a keyboard that has dedicated support for macOS, such as volume control, music play/stop/previous track /next track keys. Good news is I called Unicomp and spoke to Troy about this and he was kind enought to tell me I can place an order and request a custom configuration at a small fee to have the extra macOS features added. I did that and my keyboard has all the extra macOS keys functioning as expected. It even has the window key replaced with the macOS command key.</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_mac_keys.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M with macOS layout"></p><h3 id="unicomp-quality-of-service">Unicomp quality of service</h3><p>When you first visit Unicomp website, you get the sense that you just visited a website from 20 years ago with not the best user experience browsing or ordering. When you research Unicomp on the internet you won’t find much activity on social media or any form of marketing.</p><p>Please do not be put off by this and don’t judge them because of their dated look. The quality of service I received is one of the best I have ever received. When I called to find out more about the New Model M not only was the help I received exemplarity, but once I placed my order, even though it had the custom configuration of macOS support added was shipped within 24 hours of placing the order and the item received is fantastic in every possible way.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I am back again reunited with my old friend a Model M. I am enjoying using it so much after a gap of not having one that I am looking for excuses to use it more and more. So expect more <a href="https://www.softinio.com/">blogs</a> and <a href="https://softinio.substack.com/">newsletters</a> from me going forward, as this keyboard is a joy to use.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/NEW_M">Link to Unicomp Model M that I ordered</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Should web maps be centralized services?</p>

<p>
How many web applications or mobile apps do you use that have a map component? Rideshare apps display the location of drivers and passengers; ratings sites show the locations of restaurants; Craigslist and Wikipedia show contextual location for classifieds or encyclopedia articles. High quality, interactive maps are pervasive and simply fade into the background for end users.
</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a surge of new mapping applications. Beyond websites that <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">visualize the case count in different regions</a>, maps have become <b>critical computing infrastructure</b> for delivering health services.
</p>

<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Maps as Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>The New York City government uses Google Maps to help residents find a COVID-19 testing location near them.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/NYCCovidSites.png">
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Maps and Citizen Tech</h5>
        <p>The Taiwan government rationed face masks at pharmacies and published inventories via a public API; this enabled citizen developers, in combination with geocoding services and third-party basemaps, to create a variety of web and smartphone applications.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/Pharmacies.jpg">
    </p>
</div>

<p>
For a developer who wants to integrate a map into their application, the choices are almost always to use a <b>hosted, centralized map service</b>; developer map mindshare is dominated by multinational companies. Some hosted map examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The embeddable native maps on Google's Android or Apple's iOS/iPadOS/macOS/watchOS operating systems</li>
    <li>Google's commercial web map offering (Google Maps JavaScript API)</li>
    <li>Microsoft's recent release of Azure Maps and Amazon's AWS Location Service</li>
    <li>Commercial map GIS companies such as ESRI, MapQuest, CloudMade, HERE and Mapbox; free hosted maps like <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap Carto</a> or <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/">maps by Stamen Design</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>What is a basemap?</h4>

<p>Typical parts of a map application include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Translation from search tokens or addresses to locations (geocoding)</li>
    <li>Determining the place name or administrative division of a location (reverse geocoding)</li>
    <li>Finding directions between two locations (routing)</li>
    <li>Overlaying of domain-specific geographic features, such as COVID-19 testing sites</li>
    <li><b>Showing physical and cultural context</b> on maps, such as city names, nearby points of interest, and roads</li> 
</ul>

<p>It's this last component that we usually call a <b>basemap</b> - especially if it <b>displays map labels</b>, and is zoomable or <b>multi-resolution, implying the application of <i>cartographic generalization</i></b>.


</p><div>
    <div>
        <h5>Map Labels</h5>
        <p>A basemap is most useful for context if it displays map labels. Labels may be in a single language, but might display more than one language, alternate names, or transcriptions: for example, Romaji labels on maps of Japan.</p>
         
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/LabelScript.jpg">
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Generalization - More Art than Science</h5>
        <p>When the map scale is decreased - in this case by a factor of 2 - less relevant geographic features can be removed from the map. The ideal generalization <b>keeps the visual density of the map constant as scale is decreased</b>, even though the number of geographic features existing within those bounds increases exponentially.</p>
         
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/Generalize.jpg">
    </p>
</div>
<p>
Single-scale wayfinding maps you see in the real world are labeled and generalized by cartographers; multi-scale basemap services accomplish this in an <b>automated way</b>. The sophistication of computer programs to do this - especially at whole earth scale - can be grossly underestimated, even by experienced programmers. Good labeling and generalization are taken for granted, like good font rendering and typesetting - invisible when successful, glaringly flawed when unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>This also illustrates the key difference between a basemap and a dataset of geographic features, such as <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. <b>OSM is not a cartographic product; it does not attempt any generalization or ranking of features. </b> <a href="http://naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> is an example of a cartographic product - it include fields such as <code>scalerank</code> to assist in generalization, curated by human editors.
</p>
<p>
<b>In theory, basemaps are fungible</b> - the cartographic context required is similar among diverse applications. So why do developers - and as a consequence, the World Wide Web - gravitate towards a small handful of hosted map platforms?
</p>

<h4>Mapmakers: Victims of Lofty Expectations</h4>

<p>
    The basemap status quo is defined by the cutting edge commercial product, and right now that's Google Maps. <b>Users are accustomed to, and will demand, a seamless abstraction of the physical world.</b> Map panning and zooming should be instantaneous, so designers of a high performance cartographic system must take into account:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The completeness and quantity of the underlying geodata</li>
    <li>The arrangement and indexing of geodata to achieve low latency</li>
    <li>Tile schemes and partitioning for generalized data</li>
    <li>Protocols for fetching and caching those tiles over the network</li>
    <li>Choice of a rasterization API like Cairo or OpenGL and the flow of vertex data to them</li> 
</ul>
<p>
The desired end product is a videogame-like, sixty-frames-per-second experience, and map systems often make the same technical compromises as games: for example, a map system that smoothly resizes labels in real time may choose to precompute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function#Applications">signed distance fields</a> for text glyphs on the server and fetch them by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">codepoint ranges</a>. This works beautifully for languages that use at most a few hundred Latin characters, but navigating to places that use Han characters such as China or Japan will degrade performance. Thus a cartographic system demands holistic design around tradeoffs such as latency or localization capabilities.
</p>
<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Not Good Enough Anymore</h5>
        <p>Mapquest in the early 2000s required the user to click arrow buttons to pan and zoom; maps in 2020 are expected to respond instantly to mouse wheel scroll and finger pinch gestures.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/mapquest-2.png">
    </p>
</div>

<h4 id="cartography-commodity">Serving Maps: best left to BigCorps?</h4>
<p>
    Given the demanding technical requirements above, it's easy to be led into thinking <b>maps are too hard for individual developers to solve and should be outsourced to a third-party hosted service.</b> A cartographic system is very "full-stack" in nature, but the commoditization of some potential components, like PostGIS or HTTP accelerators, makes the overall task less daunting. Bigness isn't really a constraint; the OpenStreetMap dataset as XML is <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">about 100 gigabytes</a>. Let's estimate 10x expansion to make a cartographic product; that's still only a terabyte of data to put on a disk somewhere.
</p>
<p>
<b>Developers believe something is too hard, until it isn't.</b> Issuing of SSL Certs was in practice limited to a few Certificate Authorities until Let's Encrypt; Hosting of seekable video content was only done by big sites in concert with CDNs, but now we have the standardized, hardware-accelerated HTML <code>video</code> element and ubiquitous broadband. Email is a notable counterexample; you've been able to run your own Mail Transfer Agent since the beginning, but the Hobbesian underworld of spam and phishing drives users into the oligopoly of a few providers.
</p>

<p>Serving maps is hard but not insurmountable; I'll suggest a factor limiting the landscape of web maps is not data bigness or the speed of slinging geodata down tubes, but licensing and realities of the market.</p>

<h4 id="cartography-commodity">Intellectual Property, Fine Print</h4>
<p>Firstly, mapmaking businesses rightly assert copyright over their cartography. This far predates webmaps: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street">Trap Streets</a> are a longstanding practice on print maps. This is often true even if the map is built from open data such as OSM - the derivation of a cartographic product, and quality of output, is "secret sauce" to achieve product differentiation.
</p>
<p><b>Secondly, map serving easily admits a Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) business model.</b> Shrink-wrapped software, or creating a piece of software and "selling it in a box", has been out of vogue for decades, possibly over piracy concerns, or because it has less extractive potential on enterprise budgets. 
In addition to copyright, <b>Terms of Service for hosted maps often prohibit combination with other geographic services, exclude specific use cases, or forbid caching.</b> These contracts work against developers by inventing scarcity: even if you need a small subset of map tiles, they must be fetched and billed; don't scrape the data and put it in version control.</p>
<p>
<b>The freemium, ToS-constrained nature of hosted map services disincentivizes innovation.</b> Inability to swap out the Google Maps frontend means interesting problems like labeling and generalization can't be attacked with piecemeal incrementalism. This tips developer's scales toward <i>Buy</i> rather than <i>Build</i>, especially when the hosted pay-per-hit product starts out free, often as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader">loss leader</a> for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling">bundle</a> of geospatial services. These market realities leave some mapping use cases underserved by existing technology.
</p>

<h4>Map applications ought to outlive the SaaS business lifecycle</h4>

<p>Accessing a web map over the network isn't always practical. Maps may need to be displayed on air-gapped internal applications, or work offline without cell tower reception.</p>

<p>Also, websites and mobile applications are often built by organizations separate from their long-term maintainers (e.g. universities, museums, cultural institutions); ambitious visualization projects may be deterred by clients not wanting to foot a pay-per-hit subscription. An application depending on a hosted map service may be permanently disabled if the provider deprecates their API. <b>Hard dependencies on hosted services make software worse</b> - if your data visualization uses Google Maps, don't count on it still working in a couple years.</p>

            <h3>My Engineering Axioms</h3>

            <p>A few months back I gave a talk in which I shared a list of my personal engineering axioms – things that, over the years, I've come to think of as generally true and useful to have in mind when writing code, building things, and working with others.</p>

            <p>Axiom is a fancy word, but popping a few layers off the etymology stack we arrive neatly at the ancient Greek word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BE%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1">ἀξίωμα</a>, or "that which is thought fit or worthy". I like that, and consider each item on the list at least worthy of consideration.</p>

            <p>Of course they're <b>my</b> engineering axioms – things I believe to be useful based on my own experience. Your experience may well differ. Maybe you already knew about <a href="https://martinrue.com/zzuy-a-lesson-in-perseverance/">zero termination</a>, or have better tools than <a href="https://martinrue.com/give-yourself-more-playtime/">scissors to remove bugs</a> from your programs.</p>

            <p>In any case, I thought it would be fun to share the list here, with a few brief clarifications. Some things are pretty unsurprising, but hopefully others will generate some provocative thoughts and/or interesting disagreements.</p>

            <h4>1. Change is constant.</h4>

            <p>This one shouldn't be too controversial. Almost everything is always changing, including the rate of change itself. We need to acknowledge not only that our ability to respond to change is crucial, but that how well we do it (time, cost, quality, reliability) is often a dimension of our competitiveness.</p>

            <h4>2. Your product is an asset, but code is a liability.</h4>

            <p>Your product solves your customer's problem(s), and therefore is your asset. The code itself is the cost of creating the asset. The more code you have, the more it needs to be read, tested, changed, and understood. This is especially relevant when you consider axiom 1. Accept new code (and dependency on external code) conservatively. The best code is code you don't have to write.</p>

            <h4>3. Duplication is less costly than premature abstraction.</h4>

            <p>Until you have a high degree of confidence that your abstraction is going to pay for itself because it solves a real, abstract problem you really do have, don't do it. Wait and learn more. Until then, repeating code can help avoid dependency, which itself makes the code easier to change independently or delete. A premature abstraction creates complexity through dependency and indirection, and can become a bottleneck to your ability to respond to change.</p>

            <h4>4. Code should be easy to delete.</h4>

            <p>Write code to be removable, which in large part is the same as saying "decoupled". For sure not all code needs to be similarly removable, but minimising dependencies, having clear boundaries via well-defined interfaces, and having a thoughtful overall system design allows parts to be removed/changed more easily. I once heard someone use the expression "code spent", as an alternative to "code written" and I love that. I like the implication that removing code is reducing future cost.</p>

            <h4>5. Existing code exerts a powerful influence.</h4>

            <p>The very fact it's there suggests it's correct and necessary. Hopefully it is, but not always. We need to maintain both the confidence to change it, and the ability to reason about whether we should. Don't let the existence of code itself create doubt that it can't be removed. As per axiom 4, it should be easy to remove, and the system design should be good enough to enable us to understand whether we still need it.</p>

            <h4>6. Accidental complexity is one of the biggest risks.</h4>

            <p>Accidental complexity is complexity that can be avoided, and occurs due to things like poor design, bad decisions, and not prioritising an appropriate level of simplicity within a system. If simplicity is not a goal, accidental complexity is more likely to occur as a system grows, and will gradually negatively affect almost everything from changing the system to even being able to understand it. The 2006 paper <a href="http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf">Out of the Tar Pit</a> is a worthwhile read on this subject.</p>

            <h4>7. Technical excellence can be shadowed by bad personal skills.</h4>

            <p>Unless you're working completely alone, it's not just your ability to solve technical problems, to write good code, etc, that matters. To the contrary, they matter even less if you make the people around you unhappy and less productive. Just like learning to write good code, you have to learn "to people" good as well. Empathy is a big part of this, as is recognising that people are different – be caring, be understanding, help others and ask for help yourself, be nice. Be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>8. You are not your code. Be kind to the coder, not to the code.</h4>

            <p>Code is merely a moment in time that captured what we thought we knew about something. It's not you. You may have wrote it, but since that moment (even if it was 3 minutes ago) you've grown, but the code has not. A conversation about code, good or bad, should never be personal. Keep it professional. Talk about the code, or about the problem, but don't make it about the person who wrote it. Use "we" instead of "you". Sometimes I try to pretend I wrote the code someone else wrote, which helps me avoid accidentally sounding personal.</p>

            <h4>9. Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.</h4>

            <p>We all start somewhere, and the journey is a lot more joyful when you're surrounded by patient people who want you to succeed, rather than those who make you feel like you don't belong. If you struggle with this, it may be helpful to remember that the newbie programmer almost certainly does something better than you do – perhaps they're fluent in another language, or cook amazingly, or play a sport. Just imagine yourself in the reverse role. How would you like them to treat you, the total newbie? Again: be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>10. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</h4>

            <p>Knowledge and understanding of the problem, the domain, the customer, are all far more important than whatever the first 3 letters on your business card are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cISYzA36-ZY?t=85">Even if it does have a watermark</a>. Understand how something works from first principles, build a solid understanding, and authority will follow.</p>

            <h4>11. Teaching is a form of learning in disguise.</h4>

            <p>If you think you know something, try teaching it. Often the very act of trying to explain what you know to someone else forces you to formalise your own thoughts much more clearly. Writing things down seems to have a similar effect. I've lost count of the number of times I've begun explaining something only to find I don't quite understand it as well as I thought.</p>

            <h4>12. Lift the skills of people around you, not just yourself.</h4>

            <p>A great team is never a great because of one amazing person. It's a great team because everyone challenges each other and everybody grows together. When you learn something cool, share it – help the people around you get better. As they do the same, everybody benefits and nobody gets left behind. It's also far more fun. Secondary benefit: axiom 11.</p>

            <h4>13. The longer you wait the more you'll know.</h4>

            <p>I'm still learning this and trying hard to avoid my almost default desire to decide quickly. The truth is, the longer you delay non-essential decisions the more information you'll have to lean on when the time comes to make it. Of course you can't always procrastinate a decision, but often you can, and as a minimum you should at least consider whether not knowing the answer right now is actually OK.</p>

            <h4>14. A good type system is worth its weight plus some.</h4>

            <p>Having gone backwards and forwards through various static and dynamic languages over my career, I'm currently of the opinion that a good type system is worth its overhead. A good type system shouldn't carry all that much overhead. If the type system is designed well, it can almost feel like a dynamic language (via features like inference and flow analysis) while removing a whole class of issues that the compiler can handle far better and quicker than you can. Developments like ownership in Rust are a nice example of how this has gone even further than people would have imagined years back.</p>

            <h4>15. The right team of people trumps everything else.</h4>

            <p>Having a team of people who just want to work together and build great things makes a lot of other problems easier to deal with. The word "right" here is highly subjective and contextual, but at least anecdotally, empathy, respect, and friendship have been recurring elements of great teams I've been part of.</p>

            <h4>16. Stick to boring technology, unless there's a good reason not to.</h4>

            <p>Boring tech is often older and better understood. There's battle-hardened experience of how to use it effectively, better understanding of its failure modes, and it's easier to find people and resources on how to best apply it. I really like Dan McKinley's idea of <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation tokens</a>. You only get 3. Use them to adopt or build brand new stuff – ideally stuff that will make you better at your core competency – but any more than 3 and the risk of never reaching stability/maturity starts to grow.</p>

            <h4>17. Have the smallest team possible, but no smaller. Grow it carefully.</h4>

            <p>A play on a well-known quote, and your mileage may vary on this one. In my career so far, I've reliably seen smaller teams be more effective than larger ones. There's a balance to be found, for sure, which depends on the magnitude and complexity of the problem you're solving. That said, smaller teams benefit from less communication overhead, less room for miscommunication, and more space for everyone's voice to be heard. In a smaller team, it also feels more personal, and I feel more responsible, and I like that.</p>

            <h4>18. Rest.</h4>

            <p>I'm happy to see the gradual de-sexification of …</p></article></div>

      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

This could make it easier for healthcare providers to estimate the expected clinical picture.</p><p>This study, conducted in eleven hospitals, has now been published in the scientific journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Felifesciences.org%2Farticles%2F63195&amp;t=ODVmZTcxNzVlYWE5OTc2ZDk3ZDc3MWNkN2ZkZWQ5MmUwZjY2NmE5ZSxPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608871560"><i>eLife</i></a>.</p><p>In patients presenting to hospitals with a COVID-19 infection, full blood count analysis (hemocytometry) are commonly performed at the emergency department and during hospitalization. COVID-19 is accompanied by specific changes in the circulating blood cells that are analyzed by a full blood count. These changes in the blood cells, especially those that can be identified using new techniques, are used to create an algorithm with a predictive value. The developed algorithm appears to predict the course of COVID-19 better than the value of the individual blood cells, as used so far. The reliability increases to 93% after six days.</p><h2><b>Predicting disease progression</b></h2><p>Using data generated by full blood count measurements, the researchers wanted to know whether it is possible to predict whether a hospitalized COVID-19 patient will become seriously ill and needs treatment at the Intensive Care. For this purpose, they examined the data of 982 adult patients in eleven different hospitals across Europe. And this turned out to be possible: specific changes in the circulating blood cells of COVID-19 patients proved to be of use as indicators whether a serious course of events was expected. New laboratory techniques make it possible to detect whether immune cells in the blood are activated and it turned out that especially these activated cells were more present of COVID-19 patients with a severe course, including during the early course of the disease. In a second study population the researchers were able to confirm the value of the prognostic score.</p><h2><b>Cheap and available</b></h2><p>Internist-infectiologist and principal investigator André van der Ven of Radboud university medical center explains: “A full blood count is a fully automated, inexpensive, immediately available measurement and one of the most requested laboratory determinations in the world. Full blood count measurements are also routinely requested from COVID-19 patients who present to the hospital. By using certain techniques, the character of certain blood cells can be better determined and by using these new techniques, we have been able to develop a reliable prognostic score. This score gives a good insight into whether a serious course of events can be expected and can help healthcare professionals to make treatment decisions”.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radboudumc.nl%2Fen%2Fnews-items%2F2020%2Ffull-blood-count-covid-19-patients-predict-disease-severity&amp;t=ZWY2OGZiMTFjYzBmNDg5ZTljM2QyMzcwZmI5ODU0NWM2Mjk2MmVmOSxPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608871560">Radboud University Medical Center</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“A novel haemocytometric COVID-19 prognostic score developed and validated in an observational multicentre European hospital-based study”, <i>eLife</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.7554%2FeLife.63195&amp;t=MTk2ZjFhOWZhOGMxNTYyOWZjZjdiZjU0OTJmOGU4NDBlOWU0ZTFmNixPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608871560">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63195</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632175500576653312/blood-test-covid19-infection-prediction">Novel blood test predicts which COVID-19 patients will develop severe infection</a></p>

				<p>Soy is the main ingredient in our cheese. Surprisingly often, we get asked some version of this question: "Isn't soy bad for the environment?"</p><p>The short answer is: No, quite the contrary.</p><p>The rest of this post is devoted to the long answer.</p><p>Since we started working on <a href="https://yeticheese.com/">Yeti Cheese</a>, we realized that there's a lot of misinformation around soybean. Over and over, we read and hear stuff about soy that is just plain wrong from people that otherwise seem smart. I wonder who might be behind this? <em>*cough* meat and dairy lobbies *cough*</em></p><p>A lot of this misinformation is around environmental concerns. This belief originates from the fact that soy is a major driver of deforestation, especially in the Amazon and neighboring regions in South America. Which is true. But that's not the end of the story. What is often left out is that the vast majority of soy is grown to be used as animal feed. There are different estimates to what this number exactly is, but most are upwards of 90%.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg" alt="" width="993" height="1121" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg 993w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Break-down of soybean usage based on USDA data.</figcaption></figure><p>As the above diagram shows, the USDA reports that only 6% of soy are used as food for humans (e.g. as tofu or Yeti Cheese 😝). The rest is used either directly as animal feed, or processed to soy cake (also called soy meal) and then given to cows, pigs and chickens.</p><h3 id="but-what-about-soy-oil">But what about soy oil?</h3><p>The astute reader will now raise a remark about soy oil. After all, 19% of the processed soybean is made into oil which is consumed mostly by humans. Soy oil is one of the most used oils globally, but only because it is cheaply available as a by-product of soy cake production. Soy cake has great nutritional values and almost no fat (which has been separated into the soy oil) and is therefore sought after as livestock feed. Hence, soy cake is the main driver of soy demand, and not soy oil. There's nothing unique about soy oil, and it can easily be substituted with other plant-based oils.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg" alt="" width="853" height="636" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg 853w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Soy oil vs soy meal. Pretty clear why soy oil is separated from soy before feeding it to animals. Source: <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/">nutritionalvalue.org</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="soy-is-one-of-the-best-food-sources">Soy is one of the best food sources</h3><p>In summary, people think that soy is bad for the environment because it is grown in insane quantities for the livestock agriculture industry. It's clear that shifting the population to a plant-based diet will reduce the demand for soy dramatically. This shift will also make free a lot of land where wild vegetation and biodiversity can be restored, capturing loads of carbon in the process.</p><p>So no, soy is not bad for the environment. Quite the contrary: It's one of the best food sources we have available on this little blue planet of ours.</p><h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3><p><a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(09)00966-2/fulltext">Clinical studies show no effects of soy protein or isoflavones on reproductive hormones in men: results of a meta-analysis</a></p><p><a href="https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/soy">Soy Agriculture in the Amazon Basin</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="fd6c">As part of the DataOps team at RealScout, I recently worked on a project to tackle infrastructure issues that plagued us for some time. We struggled with ongoing maintenance in keeping our Amazon ECS clusters up to date on the latest AMIs. Our instances, in particular, use the ECS-optimized AMIs. These AMIs include ECS container agents that are responsible for keeping instances registered and managing tasks within the cluster.</p><p id="3ab4">New AMIs are regularly released and include updated ECS container agents along with any other OS or security updates. However, the steps to upgrade instances to the latest AMI while avoiding disruptions to running tasks were extremely manual and tedious. The lack of automation hindered timely AMI updates to our EC2 instances. We observed that the more out of date agents became, the more likely they were to get disconnected. Instances would enter a zombie-like state, no longer picking up tasks.</p><p id="efc0">This resulted in major disruptions to our infrastructure that impacted our entire data ingestion pipeline. This article describes our solution to automate the AMI upgrades to our cluster without any downtime. Challenges that we encountered along the way are also addressed here.</p><p id="4416"><strong>Our Infrastructure</strong></p><p id="345f">At a high-level, our infrastructure consists of EC2 instances in an ECS cluster. The EC2 instances are part of an Auto Scaling group to maintain our required capacity. We use CloudFormation to manage and provision our AWS resources consistently across our stacks.</p><p id="8d05"><strong>Our Old Process</strong></p><p id="2672">Our old process involved a series of steps performed within the AWS console. We first created a CloudFormation change set with the new AMI and executed it. This would update the template for our stack.</p><p id="c32a">Before applying the new AMI updates to the instances themselves, we needed to ensure running tasks did not get disrupted. To do so, each ECS instance is set to a state of “DRAINING.” This prevents the instance from picking up new tasks while allowing running tasks to complete. Once the instances are completely drained, we terminate the instances. We then let the Auto Scaling Group bring up new, updated instances with the latest AMI version defined in the CloudFormation template.</p><p id="3587"><strong>Our Goal</strong></p><p id="107a">We wanted to automate, as much as possible, the task of upgrading the AMI on our cluster instances with no downtime. The system needed to replicate our manual steps to terminate and bring up new instances. All running tasks should run to completion without interruption.</p><p id="47a9">We also wanted to incorporate metrics and monitoring of the ECS cluster. We know that the latest AMI versions would also include the latest agent as well. In the past, we occasionally encountered agents getting disconnected and remaining disconnected, preventing task placements on instances. We wanted peace of mind that should this scenario creep up, it would be resolved in a timely manner.</p><p id="2b37"><strong>Our Implementation</strong></p><p id="4821">We wrote a Lambda, using the boto3 SDK with the appropriate APIs for each AWS resource. Aside from the Lambda, several other AWS resources were used:</p><ul><li id="5997">SNS — the Lambda subscribes to two SNS topics: one is an AWS defined topic where AMI updates are published. The other is an SNS topic we set up to publish our own series of events.</li><li id="abfe">CloudFormation — used to define all resources within our stack. It also defines IAM roles and permissions for each resource.</li><li id="a688">CloudWatch Event — essentially, a scheduler used to trigger our Lambda every 15 minutes, where we then perform some basic health monitoring. This includes checking whether an instance is running the latest AMI and initiates a termination if not.</li><li id="1bb7">CloudWatch Alarm — we set up an alarm to monitor CPU usage across our instances. It publishes to our SNS topic anytime CPU usage drops below 10%. We use this to determine when our instance is idle and therefore, no longer running any tasks.</li><li id="fe86">Auto Scaling Group — our EC2 instances are part of an auto scaling group. The auto scaling group is responsible for maintaining our required capacity. It automatically provisions new instances as needed to meet capacity.</li><li id="0448">LifeCycle Hooks — as its name implies, these allow us to hook into the lifecycle of an EC2 instance. It lets us pause a termination event and run some custom actions before resume termination.</li></ul><p id="fbef">High-level descriptions along with some code snippets are provided below to describe the three main functions of the Lambda.</p><p id="d81f">1) When a new AMI is available, we update our CloudFormation template to include the new version. We subscribe to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS-AMI-SubscribeTopic.html" rel="noopener">Amazon ECS-optimized AMI</a> topic to receive update notifications. Once our Lambda receives an event that a new AMI is published, it creates and executes a change set for our CloudFormation template. We notify our team of the new AMI and when the change set gets executed via DataDog and Slack integrations. At this point, the only actual change is only to our CloudFormation template. We do not apply the change to the instances yet.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3108/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png" width="1554" height="422" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Updating CloudFormation template with new AMI</figcaption></figure><p id="1b15">2) Our next step performs a couple of health checks. We configure a CloudWatch event that runs every 15 minutes to check for any EC2 instances with disconnected agents. Since it is possible for agents to periodically get disconnected for various reasons and reconnect on their own, we implemented a check to detect agents disconnected for longer than 30 minutes. Instances disconnected for longer than our grace period are terminated. The auto scaling group then brings up a new, healthy instance. This does rely on some higher-level architecture to reschedule any ECS tasks that are killed as a result of this, so consider that for your own setup.</p><p id="ccfd">The second health check verifies if all instances are running on the latest AMI as specified in our CloudFormation template. Since we immediately update our template when a new AMI is published, our scheduled health check detects any instances not on the AMI within a 15 minute interval at most. To kick off this chain of events, we simply terminate the out-of-date instances, and again, rely on the auto scaling group to bring up new instances containing the latest AMI.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1682/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png" width="841" height="240" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Check for outdated instance AMIs and agent health</figcaption></figure><p id="3088">3) The final step is where the bulk of the work is in our Lambda. The importance here, however, is that we ensure instances are gracefully terminated. A lifecycle hook plays a major part in doing so. We set up a life cycle hook that subscribes to an SNS event when an instance is terminating. The hook allows us to pause the termination and perform a series of actions before completing the instance terminations.</p><p id="31bb">Once a termination is detected, we set the status of each instance to DRAINING. We then re-publish an event to request termination again for the instance. This new termination request event will trigger our Lambda again. This time, we check for any running tasks on instances marked as DRAINING.</p><p id="3220">For any instances that are still draining, we set a CloudWatch alarm to check when the instance becomes idle, indicating it is no longer running any tasks. This is slightly different than similar implementations where an event is re-published (i.e, continues to loop) to check for running tasks. This introduces an additional AWS resource to the layer. Since we occasionally have some very long running tasks (e.g, 12 hours), we decided to go with using an alarm to detect CPU usage to determine when the instance was likely drained. If the CPU usage on an instance drops to less than 10%, the CloudWatch alarm triggers an event, where we then check again if all tasks are complete. This approach cut out wasteful, continuous looping for very long running tasks.</p><pre><span id="869f">cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(<br> AlarmName=f"Check_Idle_{instance['ec2InstanceId']}",<br> AlarmDescription='Instance pending termination appears idle (&lt;= 10%)',<br> AlarmActions=[topic_arn],<br> MetricName='CPUUtilization',<br> Namespace='AWS/EC2',<br> Statistic='Average',<br> Dimensions=[{'Name': 'InstanceId', 'Value': instance['ec2InstanceId']}],<br> Period=60, # seconds<br> EvaluationPeriods=1,<br> Threshold=10,<br> ComparisonOperator='LessThanOrEqualToThreshold',<br> TreatMissingData='breaching'<br>)</span></pre><p id="0bfe">Once instances no longer have running tasks, we allow the termination to complete:</p><pre><span id="ba48">asg.complete_lifecycle_action(<br> LifecycleHookName=msg['LifecycleHookName'],<br> AutoScalingGroupName=msg['AutoScalingGroupName'],<br> LifecycleActionResult='CONTINUE',<br> InstanceId=instance['ec2InstanceId'])</span></pre><p id="dc64">Our implementation was influenced by AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automatically-update-instances-in-an-amazon-ecs-cluster-using-the-ami-id-parameter" rel="noopener">example</a> implementation. The main tweak we made was using CloudWatch alarms to notify when an instance has completed all running tasks.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3680/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png" width="1840" height="762" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Using a lifecycle hook to gracefully terminate instances</figcaption></figure><p id="08aa"><strong>Challenges along the way</strong></p><p id="8a4e">One of the biggest challenges was the various AWS resources needed (on top of our existing AWS resources) to fully automate the instance upgrades. The complexity of configuring each component in the CloudFormation templates, along with proper IAM roles and permissions was a big task. Wading through the AWS documentation and understanding how to hook up the APIs to communicate with each resource was also a big undertaking. Through a bit of trial and error, we were able to get all pieces working together.</p><p id="4686"><strong>Results</strong></p><p id="b9ef">Since our implementation, we have observed that new Optimized ECS AMIs are generally released about two or three times a month. For us, it is a great feeling each time to see a Slack notification alerting our team of a new AMI quickly followed by a notification of the AMI update to our CloudFormation template. The template update itself occurs within 2 minutes of a newly published AMI. And from there, the rolling upgrade gets initiated in less than 15 minutes, making us very happy campers! On top of that, the additional scheduled monitoring gives us confidence that our container agents are healthy and connected as expected. Needless to say, our efforts were rewarded with a much more resilient system and time saved cumulatively each month!</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>13</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s not a clickbait title, but I understand why it looks that way.</p>



<p>I’ve made my thoughts about the 10x developer trope <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/06/listening-7-deliberate-appreciation/">extremely clear</a>. I think that someone who produces 10x as much code as someone else has left a wake of destruction that will slow down other developers. I don’t think 10x counts if you achieve it by slowing down everyone else. I think 10x has to take into account how you impact other people.</p>



<p>And <em>that,</em> paradoxically, suggests a path for how to become a 10x developer: empower and enable other people such that nine additional developers’ worth of work gets done. You can do that by making nine other developers’ workflows 2x smoother. You can also do that by making 18 other developers’ workflows 50% smoother, or 90 other developers’ workflows 10% smoother.</p>

<p>At some point, your biggest gains in your X are gonna be in improving the ecosystem for other developers. On occasions when I have succeeded at that, from <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">driving workplace changes</a> to <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/category/teaching/">teaching computer science classes</a>, I have noticed that I’m using one or more of three techniques. So I thought I’d list them here.</p>



<h3>First, establish the motivation.</h3>



<p>Learning is work. Sometimes, it’s boring or difficult work. Folks don’t undertake that kind of work unless they understand why they should. That’s not as simple as <em>telling</em> them why. Understanding comes from engaging with the material.</p>



<p>Suppose you want to make a major code change that affects your team’s workflow. If you blaze forward and do that without buy-in, the team will resent it (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">as we’ve discussed in more detail here</a>). So I recommend starting with individual conversations about the reasons for the change:</p>



<blockquote><p><span>What is bothering you about your team’s current workflow that motivates you to push your solution? Are you annoyed at having to write the same code over and over in different places? Are you tired of trying to poke your way around an opaque tool? Are you losing track of things that cost you time and money? Before you&nbsp;</span><em>push</em><span>&nbsp;your solution,&nbsp;</span><em>pull</em><span>&nbsp;your coworkers to it by making sure they feel the pain that you feel.</span></p><p>Before I do a major refactor, I’ll deliberately pair program with key people on my team on the kind of problems that my refactor would solve. I want them to experience the pain firsthand; I want to hear them say ‘oh my&nbsp;<em>god&nbsp;</em>this is annoying.’ After I have that admission of pain from a critical mass of people on my team, I’ll propose my solution, and I’ll offer to spearhead the refactor. I will craft a concise explanation of how our workflow changes after the refactor, and I’ll point out why I think the new way is nicer for us than the way we’re doing it now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ‘negative testimonials’ about the old way, which I can whip out to capture the attention and agreement of others on my team. This approach allows me to muster support for my refactor and then, in spearheading the refactor, look like I’m taking one for the team.</p><p>Imagine the same scenario, same refactor, but instead of socializing my solution, I go off on my own, do the refactor, and push. My team didn’t understand the pain that the refactor solved, so all they’re seeing is the pain of learning the&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;way to do things. To them, it looks like I made a unilateral decision that screwed them over—the&nbsp;<em>opposite</em>&nbsp;of what a team player would do. Keep in mind, in both circumstances, I wrote the&nbsp;<em>same code</em>. The only difference is how I introduced it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In effect, even the right code changes need to be <em>sold</em>. </p>



<p>How do we know what the right code changes are? This one is tricky, but one guiding principle has helped me out a lot:</p>



<h3>Look for bonehead solutions to convoluted technical issues.</h3>



<p>Michael Feathers talks a great deal about technical simplification options in his various discussions on edge-free programming (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">here’s a more detailed look at some of those principles)</a>. But for exemplary purposes, here are a few simple solutions to complex problems that I’m especially proud of:</p>



<ul><li>I solved a thorny issue with a sometimes camouflaged, sometimes unreliable delete button by ripping it out (<a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/mobile/pull/345">Here’s the PR if you want more details</a>)</li><li>I resolved the issue of a laggy metronome in React-Native, where computationally expensive operations can result in delays for scheduled tasks. The app happened to also need to play back tracks at various multiples of their original speed. So I recorded a sound file of a metronome at 120 BPM, calculated what speed to play it by dividing the BPM the musician requested by 120, and wrote one method that shelled out to <code>expo-av</code> to play accurate-to-tempo sound files for both the metronome and the backtracks.</li><li>I resolved an issue of regulating how often a person should be allowed to log their mood by realizing the issue was fake (assumed foil to “let’s make sure they log it at least this often”) and letting them log as often as they want (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">more details here</a>).</li></ul>



<p>Each of these solutions made the code cleaner and eliminated<em> </em>multiple problems with the product. But they were not genius solutions. In fact, they were easy to miss precisely because complex problems don’t scream “I have a bonehead solution.”</p>


	
	


<p><strong>One drawback: </strong>the tech industry generally rewards churning out tons of code <em>over</em> elegant solutions. Chen Lin recently <a href="https://twitter.com/votecapgood/status/1337920511095918592">tweeted about</a> his experience with this at Uber. Chen is responding to <a href="https://twitter.com/mountain_ghosts/status/1337552024821510144">this commentary</a>, which starts out salty but goes on to articulate a rarely-discussed element of how the tech industry functions: tech executives <em>have</em> to make their work appear innovative in order to secure VC funding. So they’re forced to artificially “make it innovative” by filing patents or hopping on the latest trends. In the case of Uber and iOS development, that imperative <a href="https://twitter.com/StanTwinB/status/1336890442768547845">burned them badly</a>.</p>



<p>Academia is similar: <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/watt-jeremy.html">Dr. Jeremy Watt</a>, author of <em><a href="https://github.com/jermwatt/machine_learning_refined">Machine Learning Refined</a></em>, articulates how academics <em>have</em> to make their work appear novel in order to get published, and they have to get published to keep their jobs, so they’re forced to artificially differentiate similar concepts—to convolute rather than simplify.</p>



<p>There’s a great <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552576454021120">explanation from Mekka Okereke</a> about how to counteract some of this as an engineer. It shares a lot with our “first establish the motivation” approach—namely, by starting from the <em>problem</em>, not the solution.</p>



<p><strong>Also, a giant caveat: </strong>This solution is not always there. Sometimes the solution just has to be clever, or complicated, or messy. Sadly I can’t give you an ironclad heuristic for how to find them or how to confirm their existence. I can tell you this: in most cases where I have found them, I have found them by popping <em>up</em> a level from the implementation level to the design level. </p>



<p>Also, this recommendation applies specifically to technical solutions: it does not apply, for example, to racism or fascism. The problems we’re talking about here are de facto circumscribed by the scope of an application. When we’re talking about a generational cultural, political, and structural phenomenon, “just rip out X” doesn’t work.</p>

										<figcaption>Nor does one simply solve [insert insidious social issue here].</figcaption>
					</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>White supremacy culture in tech alone is so insidious and multifaceted that I’ve got <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/02/07/the-price-of-whiteness-in-tech/">an ongoing series</a> about reimagining different parts of tech through a not-white-supremacist lens. But also, listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1249908489826099201">Marco Rogers about this caveat</a>. He knows more things than I do.</p>



<p>ANYWAY, anyway, anyway. </p>



<p>So we’ve talked about selling our changes, and we’ve talked about making changes that reduce the scope of complexity. Naturally, the third thing I find myself doing, is selling new knowledge <em>by</em> reducing the scope of complexity. Here we go:</p>



<h3>Try to spread intuition with as few prerequisites as possible.</h3>



<p>One of my Mobile Software Development students asked me what frameworks he should consider for testing a Python app he’s working on. Here’s what I said:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>In Python there are two leading options: unittest and pytest. Both work fine. When I’m working on teams, I tend to go with pytest because the output is a little nicer.&nbsp;</p><p>But…when I’m&nbsp;<em>teaching</em>&nbsp;Python, I don’t use a testing framework at all. I write methods that call the method I’m testing, and then I use Python’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp" target="_blank">built in assert keyword</a>&nbsp;to check the state of the modified objects or return values. Reason being, I don’t want to jump into the complexity of all the different stuff you can use to test until students understand&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we test. I try to use the minimum toolset that gets the point across.</p></div></blockquote>



<p><br>One of the big things that educational approaches manage to screw up, in my view, is to introduce prerequisites that make the topic in question <em>harder</em> instead of <em>easier</em>. Fluent Forever founder Gabriel Wyner <a href="https://youtu.be/bPVeIHcgfTs?t=74">articulates how language learning often depends on translation</a>—which is a whole, separate, <em>difficult</em> skill. So when I’m trying to help someone build intuition, I’ll try to eliminate as many dependencies as possible. </p>



<p>I’ll show you an example for teaching testing in Python. I pulled this example out of a notebook that I share with my <a href="https://www.emergentworks.org/">Emergent Works</a> and <a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode">Justice Through Code</a> mentee. She was working on writing a Sudoku solver. Of course, to solve a Sudoku, it helps to know when a Sudoku is solved. </p>



<p>Suppose we start with a similar but simpler puzzle; each row and each column must each possess one copy of each number, like this:</p>



<pre><code>puzzle = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [2, 1, 4, 3],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
]</code></pre>



<p>This is a valid puzzle, albeit smaller than your typical 9 x 9. </p>



<p>It shows a way of <em>representing</em> our problem space—a list of lists. We could make a <code>Puzzle </code>class for this, with all kinds of methods on it. I’m not doing that yet. I’m doing the <em>minimum thing</em> that gets the point across: we need a way to represent our data. Here is a way to represent our data with minimal dependencies and indirection. </p>



<p>We’re gonna do the same thing for the test, no test framework involved (yet!):</p>



<pre><code>def valid_puzzle(puzzle):
    try: 
        # Python is duck-typed, so …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content"><p><code>jq</code> is a command line tool for parsing and modifying JSON. It is useful for extracting relevant bits of information from tools that output JSON, or REST APIs that return JSON. Mac users can install <code>jq</code> using homebrew (<code>brew install jq</code>); see <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/">here</a> for more install options.</p>
<p>In this post we'll examine a couple "real world" examples of using <code>jq</code>, but let's start with...</p>
<h2 id="-code-jq-code-basics">
    <a href="#-code-jq-code-basics">
      
    </a>
    <code>jq</code> Basics</h2><p>The most basic use is just tidying &amp; pretty-printing your JSON:</p>
<pre><code>$ USERX=<span>'{"name":"duchess","city":"Toronto","orders":[{"id":"x","qty":10},{"id":"y","qty":15}]}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"city"</span>: <span>"Toronto"</span>,
  <span>"orders"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>10</span>
    },
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>15</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>I like this pretty-printing/formatting capability so much, I have an alias that formats JSON I've copied (in my OS "clipboard") &amp; puts it back in my clipboard:</p>
<pre><code><span>alias</span> jsontidy=<span>"pbpaste | jq '.' | pbcopy"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'.'</code> in the <code>jq '.'</code> command above is the simplest jq "filter." The dot takes the input JSON and outputs it as is. You can read more about filters <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters">here</a>, but the bare minimum to know is that <code>.keyname</code> will filter the result to a property matching that key, and <code>[index]</code> will match an array value at that index:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.name'</span>
<span>"duchess"</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 10
}
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>[]</code> will match <em>each</em> item in an array:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[].id'</span>
<span>"x"</span>
<span>"y"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Filtering output by value is also handy! Here we use <code>|</code> to output the result of one filter into the input of another filter and <code>select(.qty&gt;10)</code> to select only orders with <code>qty</code> value greater than 10:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[]|select(.qty&gt;10)'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 15
}
</code></pre>
<p>One more trick: filtering by <strong>key</strong> name rather than value:</p>
<pre><code>$ ORDER=<span>'{"user_id":123,"user_name":"duchess","order_id":456,"order_status":"sent","vendor_id":789,"vendor_name":"Abe Books"}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$ORDER</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
{
  <span>"user_id"</span>: 123,
  <span>"user_name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"order_id"</span>: 456,
  <span>"order_status"</span>: <span>"sent"</span>,
  <span>"vendor_id"</span>: 789,

    A Usecase: Debugging Some Prometheus Metrics</h2><p>I have a prometheus metric showing up locally that doesn't look quite right:</p>
<pre><code>async_task_total{task_name="/Users/duchess/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/web/page/globals.go(189):(*GlobalsPopulator).Populate"} 6
</code></pre>
<p>The fact that the <code>task_name</code> value is a <em>filename</em> is a red flag–<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels">it's bad to have labels with high cardinality</a> and I'm not sure how many of these there are. I want to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do these <code>task_name</code> labels look like in production?</li>
<li>How many unique values are there for these labels?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
    <a href="#1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
      
    </a>
    1. Getting the label values in production</h3><p>At my company there is a <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> tool we'll call <code>pquery</code> that allows prometheus metrics to be queried from the command line, and it outputs JSON–how conventient! I use this tool in the following examples. You don't have this tool, but fear not: <a href="https://learndevops.substack.com/p/hitting-prometheus-api-with-curl">this wonderful post</a> explains how to query prometheus using <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> which is essentially what <code>pquery</code> does.</p>
<p>Using <code>pquery</code> we can view prometheus metrics from our various clusters. But even if we filter for this exact metric name, it's more data than we can easily look at. We'll use <code>wc -l</code> (wordcount: count lines) to get a rough idea of how much data we're working with:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | wc <span>-l</span>
316117
</code></pre>
<p>316,117 lines of JSON! Oof! We want to iterate over the metrics. But what jq filter do we need to access the array of metrics? I find <code>head</code> useful for figuring out what the top level keys are for a large json structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | head -n 20
{
    <span>"data"</span>: {
        <span>"result"</span>: [
            {
                <span>"metric"</span>: {
                    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,
                    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"instance"</span>: <span>"10.55.55.55:9393"</span>,
                    <span>"job"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"kubernetes_pod_name"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-b446b7ccd-6mls6"</span>,
                    <span>"namespace"</span>: <span>"noweb"</span>,
                    <span>"netpol"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"node_name"</span>: <span>"gke-production-04-3455c6df-j526"</span>,
                    <span>"release"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"task_name"</span>: <span>"/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/core/user/user.go(67):GetAccountDetails"</span>
                },
                <span>"value"</span>: [
                    1600981630.344,
                    <span>"2"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>jq 'keys'</code> if you just want the key names:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'keys'</span>
[
  <span>"data"</span>,
  <span>"status"</span>
]
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway we can see from above that <code>.data.result</code> is the "filter" path for the metrics themselves. Let's get the <strong>first result</strong> (<code>[0]</code>) of this array so we can see what one metric looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'.data.result[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"metric"</span>: {
    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,
    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
    <span>"instance"</span>: <span>"10.55.55.55:9393"</span>,
    <span>"job"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
    <span>"kubernetes_pod_name"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-b446b7ccd-6mls6"</span>,
    <span>"namespace"</span>: <span>"noweb"</span>,
    <span>"netpol"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
    <span>"node_name"</span>: <span>"gke-production-04-3455c6df-j526"</span>,
    <span>"release"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
    <span>"task_name"</span>: <span>"/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/core/user/user.go(67):GetAccountDetails"</span>
  },
  <span>"value"</span>: [
    1600981906.069,
    <span>"2"</span>
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Oops! That <code>app</code> value (<code>toodle-app-alpha</code>) indicates a mistake: I'm only interested in results from the <code>toodle-app</code> app, <em>not</em> from other apps that may also emit this metric (such as the <code>alpha</code> deployment we see here). We could <code>select</code> for this using jq, but <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/"><code>promql</code> already lets us filter by metric names</a> so we'll do that instead: <code>pquery 'async_task_total{app="toodle-app"}'</code>.</p>
<p>We're interested in the <code>task_name</code> value in the <code>metric</code> object, so let's pluck that from <strong>each</strong> item in the array above:</p>

          <p>
We're pretty deep into the whole COVID thing. Where I am in the world, we've been in some variation of lockdown for nine months now. It has meant a lot of changes to my working life, but one of the larger changes to my workflow is that there's no longer a giant whiteboard mounted directly behind me. "Diagrams as code" tools such as <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> and <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a> have gone some way towards filling the void, and I'll examine how far they go in helping me communicate software architecture.
<span id="continue-reading"></span></p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">Why did I like the whiteboard so much?&nbsp;<a href="#why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much" aria-label="Anchor Link For: why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">
    
</a></h2>
<p>I think the main thing here is the speed of iteration. When scribbling out an architectural idea, there's usually a bit of back and forth. As long as the diagram is on the whiteboard still, it's easy to erase a few lines here and there and add a few elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the drag and drop functionalities of tools such as <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">LucidChart</a> or <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Draw.io</a> can work for this. With that said, I've suffered the indignity of a stray arrow magnetising itself to the wrong box. It's not the worst thing to happen, nor the hardest thing to fix, but I felt I could go faster. </p>
<h2 id="heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">Heaping praise on diagrams as code<a href="#heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code" aria-label="Anchor Link For: heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Being able to delegate how the diagram looks to something else is a boon for my productivity. I know that I can smash out a diagram in Mermaid syntax and the diagram will look pretty good. Don't get me wrong - no graphics design awards are coming my way, but by and large, the diagram is correct and looks clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a simple example that I wrote with Mermaid. Take the following scenario. Service A schedules a task to run at some point with an external service - think of some kind of process that can't be immediately actioned, such as a scheduled task. We're immediately told whether task scheduling worked. If all goes well, the job is eventually delegated to a worker, which carries out it's assigned task. Once that's done, the worker dispatches a webhook notification to service B, allowing us to do whatever further processing logic we need to. Now, I want to describe that using Mermaid syntax. This is what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>sequenceDiagram  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service A  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service Worker  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service B  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service A -&gt;&gt;+ External Service: createJob(notifyEndpoint, jobParameters)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service -&gt;&gt;+ Service A: jobScheduleStatus(id, status)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service --&gt;&gt;+ External Service Worker: startProcessingJob(id)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service Worker -&gt;&gt;+ External Service Worker: processJob(id)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service Worker -&gt;&gt;+ Service B: dispatchWebhookToNotifyEndpoint(notification)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service B -&gt;&gt;+ Service B: handleWebhook(notification)
</span></code></pre>
<p>And that produces a diagram that looks something like this<sup><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> :</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/practices/fill-void-physical-whiteboard/mermaid-diagram-20201218194918.png" alt="Visual Diagram for the above Mermaid Sequence Diagram code"></p>
<p>The sequence diagram allows me to express this chain of events tersely in code, but richly in the diagram. I'm able to quick and easily represent operational quirks. For instance, the initialisation of job processing is asynchronous. It doesn't occur immediately, but at some unspecified time in the future. In the diagram, I can express that with a dashed line, and in the code for the diagram, that's as easy as <code>--&gt;&gt;+</code>. Sequence numbers make it easy for me to discuss the diagram with other people, as we can refer to steps by their number. And to add them in was as easy as including a parameter when generating the diagram:&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code><span>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"theme"</span><span>: </span><span>"default"</span><span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"sequence"</span><span>: {&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"showSequenceNumbers"</span><span>: </span><span>true&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now all the example is perhaps not the most powerful use case. It's a little simple, and it's not tricky to put together a diagram that looks like this with a GUI. In reality these diagrams have a fair bit more going on.</p>
<p>But putting it together in code feels a lot faster for me. The diagram is unsullied by my clumsiness at getting arrows to magnetise to the right box in a WSYWIG web GUI. And this whole thing took me two or three minutes to write - I spent more time coming up with the scenario. I can take the generated image and put it in a ticket, or a slack message, and use it as a visual aid for communicating my thought processes.&nbsp;Even though architectures are more complex in reality, I don't feel like a sense of not being able to express them using these tools.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that I'm more likely to be able to evolve this diagram over time. It doesn't rely on me preserving a whiteboard for all eternity. I can come back later, and make a quick tweak or edit, based on feedback or what have you. I write code every day, so as a method of building something - I'm used to it. Should I make a mistake, or if I want to make some tweak somewhere, I can do that without much fuss. I could even commit these into source control if I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to construct diagrams whilst sustaining speed, correctness and clarity are pretty much all I need. If I want to make a particularly pretty diagram (maybe it's for external eyes) I'd use the drag and drop tools. The more complex autogenerated diagrams tend to have a few visual quirks. But where I want the diagram to be evolvable, these tools fill the niche well. The hosted services that provide diagramming as a service see the value in these tools. For example, LucidChart supports its own flavour of syntax, and Draw.IO supports PlantUML and Mermaid syntax.</p>
<h2 id="but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">But does it replace a whiteboard?<a href="#but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard" aria-label="Anchor Link For: but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Ish. Scribbling on a whiteboard feels faster still - at least for initial construction. And the back and forth with people when etching on a board feels easier.</p>
<p>But, I've gotten faster generating diagrams from code. The syntax for mermaid and PlantUML is pretty simple and easy to remember after a spot of practice. And in a way, it feels accessible in a different way to a whiteboard. We don't have to be in the same room to collaborate. The escape hatch here is that we can always switch to using the WSYWIG to construct the diagram instead. It's slower, but if someone's not up to speed with the syntax and it's not worth them getting up to speed, it's an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And beyond that, it lets me get a head start on any artefacts we need for documentation. Producing a quick diagram in the planning phases of a ticket that I can evolve later into something more formal is a big win for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="calling-it">Calling It<a href="#calling-it" aria-label="Anchor Link For: calling-it">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Constructing diagrams as code does not replace everything a whiteboard does for me. But it's fast enough, it's easy to get started, and it makes it easy to involve remote people. If everyone knows the syntax, remote collaboration is easy, and you've still got the escape hatch of WSYWIG tools, though they feel slower to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that a quick sequence diagram, to help communicate a mental model of a solution can grease the wheels of progress a great deal.</p>

In the computer vision landscape today there are many custom object detectors that recognize objects from farm animals to phone defects. </p><h3 id="the-coco-dataset">The COCO Dataset</h3><p><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/coco-dataset/">The COCO dataset</a> is the gold standard benchmark for evaluating object detection models. The COCO (<a href="https://roboflow.com/formats/coco-json">Common Objects in COntext</a>) dataset contains over 120,000 images for training and testing, with 80 object class labels that are commonly observed in everyday life.

Recently, the YOLO name and architecture have been picked up recently by a number of computer vision researchers.</p><p><strong>YOLOv4 - </strong>Early this spring, <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB">AlexyAB</a> formalized his fork of the Darknet repo, publishing the state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">YOLOv4 model</a>. YOLOv4 was considered one of the best models for speed and accuracy performance, but did not top EfficientDet's largest model for overall accuracy on the COCO dataset.</p><p><strong>YOLOv5 - </strong>Shortly after the release of YOLOv4, Glenn Jocher (Github moniker <a href="https://github.com/glenn-jocher">glenn-jocher</a>) published his version of the YOLO model in PyTorch as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a>. Comparing how YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models stacked up against each other was nuanced – we wrote a bunch on the <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"></a><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/">YOLOv4 vs</a>.<a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"> YOLOv5 </a>debate here.</p><p>The YOLOv5 PyTorch training and architecture conversion was the most notable contribution, making YOLO easier than ever to train, <em>speeding up training time 10x relative to Darknet</em>. </p><p>One of the main reasons Scaled-YOLOv4 is implemented in the YOLOv5 PyTorch framework is, no doubt, the training routines. Glenn Jocher notably gets a shoutout in the Acknowledgments of Scaled-YOLOv4.</p><p><strong>PP-YOLO - </strong>This summer, researchers at <a href="https://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> released their version of the YOLO architecture, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/pp-yolo-beats-yolov4-object-detection/">PP-YOLO, surpassing YOLOv4 and YOLOv5</a>.

They consider a few CSP-ized CNN backbones in their network, ResNet, ResNeXt, and the traditional Darknet backbone.</p><h3 id="csp-izing">"CSP-izing"</h3><p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08036">Scaled-YOLOv4</a> paper the authors often write that they "CSP-ized" a given portion of the network. To CSP-ize means to apply the concepts laid out in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929">Cross-Stage Partial Networks</a> paper, written by <a href="https://github.com/WongKinYiu">WongKinYiu</a>. The CSP is a new way to architect convolutional neural networks that saves on computation for various CNN networks - up to 50% (for the Darknet backbone in FLOPs).</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-tiny-model">Scaling the YOLOv4-tiny model</h3><p>The YOLOv4-tiny model had different considerations than the Scaled-YOLOv4 model because, on the edge, different constraints come into play, like memory bandwidth and memory access. For the YOLOv4-tiny's shallow CNN, the authors look to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">OSANet</a> for its favorable computational complexity at little depth.</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-csp-models">Scaling the YOLOv4-CSP models </h3><p>To detect large objects in large images, the authors find that it is important to increase the depth and number of stages in in the CNN backbone and neck. (Increasing the width reportedly has little effect.) This allows them to first scale up input size and number of stages, and dynamically adjust width and depth according to realtime inference speed requirements. In addition to these scaling factors, the authors also adjust the configuration of their model's architecture in the paper.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png 695w"><figcaption>YOLOv4-P5/P6/P7 architectures (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="data-augmentations">Data Augmentations</h3><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-in-yolov4-c16bd22b2617">Data augmentation in YOLOv4</a> was one of the key contributions to YOLOv4's impressive performance. In Scaled-YOLOv4, the authors train on a less augmented dataset first, then turn up the augmentations for fine-tuning at the end of training. They also use "Test Time Augmentations," where a number of augmentations are made on the test set. Predictions are then averaged across those test augmentations to further boost their non-real time results. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-results">Scaled-YOLOv4 Results</h2><p>Evaluations show that the Scaled-YOLOv4 models set the standard for both large and small object detection models.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png 650w"><figcaption>Scaled-YOLOv4 results, inference speed on the X-axis and COCO average precision on the Y-axis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The language in the Scaled-YOLOv4 paper speaks for itself:</p><blockquote>We can see that all scaled YOLOv4 models, including YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv4-P5, YOLOv4-P6, YOLOv4- P7, are Pareto optimal on all indicators. When we compare YOLOv4-CSP with the same accuracy of EfficientDetD3 (47.5% vs 47.5%), the inference speed is 1.9 times [that of EfficientDetD3]. When YOLOv4-P5 is compared with EfficientDet-D5 with the same accuracy (51.4% vs 51.5%), the inference speed is 2.9 times [that of EfficientDet-D5]. The situation is similar to the comparisons between YOLOv4-P6 vs EfficientDet-D7 (54.3% vs 53.7%) and YOLOv4-P7 vs EfficientDet-D7x (55.4% vs 55.1%). In both cases, YOLOv4-P6 and YOLOv4-P7 are, respectively, 3.7 times and 2.3 times faster in terms of inference speed. </blockquote><p>And notably for YOLOv4-tiny:</p><blockquote>In addition, if one uses TensorRT FP16 to run YOLOv4-tiny on general GPU RTX 2080ti, when the batch size respectively equals to 1 and 4, the respective frame rate can reach 773fps and 1774fps, which is extremely fast.</blockquote><p><strong>If you want to push the ceiling for performance or speed for your object detection task, Scaled-YOLOv4 is the new place to look.</strong></p><p>The authors provide myriad ablation studies and many more research insights than we have written here.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-10-01">Android Security Bulletin of October</a>, the vulnerability <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0423">CVE-2020-0423</a> was made public with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In binder_release_work of binder.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-overview-of-binder">A Brief Overview of Binder</h3>
<p>Processes on Android are isolated and cannot access each other's memory directly. However they might require to, whether it's for exchanging data between a client and a server or simply to share information between two processes.</p>
<p>Interprocess communication on Android is performed by <strong>Binder</strong>. This kernel component provides a user-accessible character device which can be used to call routines in remote process and pass arguments to it. Binder acts as a proxy between two tasks and is also responsible, among others, for handling memory allocations during data exchange as well as managing shared object's lifespans.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Binder's internals, we invite you to read articles on the subject, such as <a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/binder-transactions-in-the-bowels-of-the-linux-kernel">Synacktiv's "Binder Transactions In The Bowels of the Linux Kernel"</a>. It will come in handy to understand the rest of this post.</p>
<h3 id="patch-analysis-and-brief-explanation">Patch Analysis and Brief Explanation</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f3277cbfba763cd2826396521b9296de67cf1bbc#diff-8aa818b39daaf6497eaab2ec0b404bcabf43616362fe9551ed7dd2278682af08">patch</a> for CVE-2020-0423 was upstreamed on October 10th in the Linux kernel with the following commit message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>binder: fix UAF when releasing todo list</p>
<p>When releasing a thread todo list when tearing down
a binder_proc, the following race was possible which
could result in a use-after-free:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thread 1: enter binder_release_work from binder_thread_release</li>
<li>Thread 2: binder_update_ref_for_handle() -&gt; binder_dec_node_ilocked()</li>
<li>Thread 2: dec nodeA --&gt; 0 (will free node)</li>
<li>Thread 1: ACQ inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 2: block on inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 1: dequeue work (BINDER_WORK_NODE, part of nodeA)</li>
<li>Thread 1: REL inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 2: ACQ inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 2: todo list cleanup, but work was already dequeued</li>
<li>Thread 2: free node</li>
<li>Thread 2: REL inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 1: deref w-&gt;type (UAF)</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem was that for a BINDER_WORK_NODE, the binder_work element
must not be accessed after releasing the inner_proc_lock while
processing the todo list elements since another thread might be
handling a deref on the node containing the binder_work element
leading to the node being freed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gives a rough overview of the different steps required to trigger a Use-After-Free, or UAF, using this bug. These steps will be detailed in the next section, for now let's look at the patch to understand where the vulnerability comes from.</p>
<p>In essence, what this patch does is to inline the content of the function <code>binder_dequeue_work_head</code> in <code>binder_release_work</code>. The only difference being that the <code>type</code> field of the <code>binder_work</code> struct is read while the lock on <code>proc</code> is still held.</p>

<p>Before this patch, it was possible to dequeue a <code>binder_work</code> struct, have another thread free and reallocate it to then change the control flow of <code>binder_release_work</code>. The next section will try to give a more thorough explanation as to why this behavior occurs and how it can be triggered arbitrarily.</p>
<h3 id="in-depth-analysis">In-Depth Analysis</h3>
<p>In this section, as an example, let's imagine that there are two processes communicating using binder: a sender and a receiver.</p>
<p>At this point, there are three prerequisites to trigger the bug:</p>
<ol>
<li>a call to <code>binder_release_work</code> from the sender's thread</li>
<li>a <code>binder_work</code> structure to dequeue from the sender thread's <code>todo</code> list</li>
<li>a free on the <code>binder_work</code> structure from the receiver thread</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's go over them one by one and try to figure out a way to fulfill them.</p>
<h4 id="calling-binder_release_work">Calling <code>binder_release_work</code></h4>
<p>This prerequisite is pretty straightforward. As explained earlier, <code>binder_release_work</code> is part of the clean up routine when a task is done using binder. It can be called explicitly in a thread using the ioctl command <code>BINDER_THREAD_EXIT</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>// Userland code from the exploit</span>

<p><code>binder_ioctl</code> will then reach the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/13abe236365485368755fb76c57a67a9b1f640d8/drivers/android/binder.c#5038"><code>BINDER_THREAD_EXIT</code></a> case and call <code>binder_thread_release</code>. <code>thread</code> is a <code>binder_thread</code> structure containing information about the current thread which made the <code>ioctl</code> call.</p>

<p>These functions are used in different places in the code, but an interesting code path is the one starting in <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/13abe236365485368755fb76c57a67a9b1f640d8/drivers/android/binder.c#2524"><code>binder_translate_binder</code></a>. This function is called when a thread sends a transaction containing a <code>BINDER_TYPE_BINDER</code> or a <code>BINDER_TYPE_WEAK_BINDER</code>.</p>
<p>A binder node is created from this binder object and the reference counter for the process on the receiving end is increased. As long as the receiving process holds a reference to this node, it will stay alive in Binder's memory. However, if the process releases the reference, the node is destroyed, which is what we will try to achieve later on to trigger the UAF.</p>
<p>First, let's explain how the binder node and the <code>thread-&gt;todo</code> list are related
in the call to <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/13abe236365485368755fb76c57a67a9b1f640d8/drivers/android/binder.c#2553"><code>binder_inc_ref_for_node</code></a>.</p>

<p>2020-12-20</p>


<p>About two years ago, I wrote a quite complicated diff tool in Clojure.<br>
It was complicated enough that I struggled to fit the algorithm in my head and the inputs were large enough that I had to make some efforts to improve performance.</p>
<p>About half a year later, I started learning Rust, ported the current state of the Clojure program into Rust, was very happy with the change<sup><a href="#hooked-on-rust">1</a></sup> and continued exclusively with Rust.<br>
While working on that project, I've developed some opinions about the two languages, especially about error handling and performance:</p>
<p>I think that these are areas where Rust excels, while they are among the weaker spots of Clojure<sup><a href="#not-hating-on-clojure">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To put my experience in context:
I had a bit more than one year of experience in Clojure when I moved to Rust.
The diff tool was by far the largest Clojure program I've ever written, and it was only about 3000 lines.<br>
When I started writing Rust, reimplementing the existing Clojure code was among my first Rust code.
I've continued learning Rust since then and have mostly stopped writing Clojure.<br>
If things have changed in Clojure recently, please let me know and I'll update the article.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling"><a href="#error-handling" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling">🔗</a>Error Handling</h2>
<p>The error handling requirements in this project were not very complicated.
All errors just needed to be logged and returned to the user.<br>
The only slightly unusual requirement was that parsing and validation logic should show all errors for each row in both uploaded excel files
(instead of just the first error) so I had to accumulate errors.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-clojure"><a href="#error-handling-in-clojure" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-clojure">🔗</a>Error Handling in Clojure</h3>
<p>Error handling in Clojure is not opinionated.<br>
<a href="https://lispcast.com/clojure-error-messages-accidental/">Similar to error messages</a>
, what error handling idioms exist in Clojure seem to me to be largely accidental or inherited from Java.</p>
<p>The standard library mostly supports <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/ex-info">exceptions</a>.<br>
There are some libraries that support returning error values instead of throwing exceptions like the error handling library <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure"><code>failjure</code></a>.<br>
Others, like the parsing library <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse"><code>instaparse</code></a>, return their own custom error values<sup><a href="#insta-result">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I used failjure to help accumulate errors in a nicer way (and because it appealed to my Haskell-influenced taste).</p>
<p>Let's look at a Clojure function from my diff tool that uses <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure#attempt-all">attempt-all</a> to parse and validate the input data.
If any errors occur, all errors are aggregated into a string:</p>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>parse
  </span><span>[country-mapping data]
  #_"</span><span>   👇 the attempt-all function exits early 
           if any binding returned a failure</span><span>"

                         list of failures concatenated into a string</span><span>"
                   (</span><span>fail/fail
                    </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>[msg (</span><span>str

                                  ::spec/rule</span><span>
                                  parse-result)]

                         </span><span>(</span><span>log/warn

                         failure))))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The identifier-expression pairs in the square brackets use the same syntax as Clojure's <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/let"><code>let</code>-form</a>
which makes it look familiar.</li>
<li>I can optionally add an error handling function to the very end, which is helpful to, e.g., log the argument of the function, as I did here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't see which functions can actually fail. I have to read them to find out.</li>
<li>Since the Clojure ecosystem doesn't have a uniform error handling style, I have to manually convert exceptions or other errors like <code>instaparse</code> error values to <code>failjure</code> errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
Since Clojure is a Lisp, it's possible to use most kinds of error handling and make it look fine, if you really want to.
The most pragmatic solution in most cases will be to use exceptions.</p>
<p>I found that readability could suffer when using less explicit error handling, especially in a dynamic language.</p>
<p>Due to the freedom of choice in error handling approacher, I was tempted to experiment more than with a more opinionated language.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-rust"><a href="#error-handling-in-rust" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-rust">🔗</a>Error handling in Rust</h3>
<p>Rust is quite opinionated about error handling.
The Rust community has worked on developing and improving common idioms, some of which were incorporated into the standard library, thereby improving the baseline error handling.</p>
<p>There's no improvement without change though, and the frequent changes have been a source of complaints.
While backwards compatibility was never broken, people that wanted their code to be idiomatic had to update it anyway.
Old tutorials and guides have therefore also become outdated.</p>
<p>There are lots of good, up-to-date articles about error handling in Rust<sup><a href="#rust-error-handling-links">4</a></sup>, which help learn the current idioms.</p>
<p>In Rust, functions that can error return the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html"><code>Result</code></a> type<sup><a href="#panic-ref">5</a></sup>.<br>
There are several libraries that make creating your own errors or handling errors from libraries easier, but they (mostly) just use the types from the standard library instead of introducing new stuff that's incompatible with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Let's look at the same function as before, but this time in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(
    </span><span>workbook</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Workbook,
    </span><span>country_mapping</span><span>: CountryMapping,
) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Rule&gt;&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> range = workbook
        .</span><span>worksheet_range</span><span>("</span><span>Rules</span><span>")

<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard library, every Rust library I've ever seen and my own application code is always using the same <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result</code></a> type, which keeps things pretty compatible.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html">The <code>?</code> operator</a> makes fallible functions visible but keeps it succinct.<br>
It also automatically converts error types where possible, which reduces the need for manual type conversion.</li>
<li>The error type I'm using here from the library <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/index.html"><code>anyhow</code></a> supports a <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/trait.Context.html"><code>.context</code></a> method, which gives otherwise unhelpful low-level errors the necessary context.<br>
This is usually done in exception-based languages by catching, wrapping and rethrowing, but this looks a lot more pleasant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to keep the error types compatible, which I accomplish in this case by not distinguishing between different error types at all<sup><a href="#anyhow-usecase">6</a></sup>.<br>
I still have to return a single error value, which means I have to manually and verbosely convert the list of errors into a single one - in this case a newline-delimited string.</li>
<li>If I want to log something when this entire function returns an error or add some <code>.context</code> to it, I would like to have the equivalent of a <code>try/catch</code>-block around the entire function body.<br>
This doesn't exist yet<sup><a href="#try-blocks">7</a></sup>, the current best practice seems to be do move the entire body into an inner function or lambda.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
In Rust, you will use the <code>Result</code> type and you will like it<sup><a href="#and-you'll-like-it">8</a></sup>.<br>
The main design decisions are whether you use some of the helper libraries and how you design your error types.</p>
<p>Designing the error types can be a challenge though, especially because it's a bit different than designing e.g. Java exception hierarchies.<br>
I was lucky that keeping up to date with the evolving error handling idioms wasn't too hard for me as I was not under time pressure and often worked in my spare time with learning as my primary objective.
It might have been painful for teams maintaining bigger production systems.<br>
The large number of error handling tutorials and articles should hopefully make it easier to learn now than it was a few years ago.</p>
<p>The learning curve aside:
To me, Rust's error handling feels like part of the secret sauce that makes it the most promising language for correctness that I know of.</p>
<h2 id="performance"><a href="#performance" aria-label="Anchor link for: performance">🔗</a>Performance</h2>
<p>The part of the program that caused performance issues was the diff algorithm and, to a slightly lesser extent, a data normalization step before that.<br>
The type of performance problems I had were mostly being CPU bound, having to generate and compare a lot of temporary data.
The large amount of data also often caused memory issues in both languages.</p>

December 21, 2020 | https://www.cortex.dev/post/reproducible-machine-learning-pipelines-with-metaflow-and-cortex | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cortex.dev/post/reproducible-machine-learning-pipelines-with-metaflow-and-cortex">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4>From training to deployment with Metaflow and Cortex</h4></p><div content-type="article"><p>If we were to design an optimal machine learning pipeline, it would be:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scalable</strong>. As workloads increased, it would scale up without issue.</li><li><strong>Reproducible</strong>. We would be able to draw a line from any model to its data.</li><li><strong>Configurable</strong>. It wouldn’t lock us into particular frameworks or tools.</li></ul><p>Typically, pipelines will tradeoff in at least one of these areas. A pipeline might be scalable, but will rely on a platform that puts limits on data scientists. Or, a pipeline will be completely configurable, but will also be glued together by a mess of ad hoc code and will be impossible to reproduce.</p><p>In this piece, I want to introduce a way to build this kind of ideal pipeline without any tradeoffs. To do this, we’ll be using <a href="https://metaflow.org/" target="_blank">Metaflow, the open source data science framework from Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">Cortex, our open source deployment platform for machine learning</a>. </p><p>Let’s start by defining our pipeline.</p><h3>Defining a pipeline in Metaflow</h3><p>Metaflow is a data science framework that provides a single API for managing different pieces of the infrastructure stack. It places an emphasis on scalability, reproducibility, and usability.</p><div><p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV5VGddmP24" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></div><p>At a high level, Metaflow allows us to define pipelines as DAGs, called “flows,” in which data undergoes a sequence of transformations called ”steps.” These steps persist transformed data as “data artifacts,” which are accessible by subsequent steps throughout the flow. </p><p>For example, say we had a training flow that loaded data (probably produced by another flow), trained multiple models with different strategies, evaluated the different models, and saved the top performer:</p><p>This is just a snapshot of our full pipeline, which I’ll be adding to in the next section, but even with just this snippet we have a repeatable training pipeline that can scale to run on many machines. We also have, thanks to Metaflow’s Client API, a way to version, audit, and reproduce these training runs.</p><p>For example, to instantiate a given step from a previous flow, we can simply pass in the flow name, run id, and step name to the Metaflow Client:</p><p>To access an artifact from a particular run, the logic is very similar:</p><p>This means that every time a flow is executed, Metaflow automatically versions and records it using a standard taxonomy. As a result, we can trace any given model’s lineage from raw data to final export. </p><p>There is much more to Metaflow, and I’d encourage you to check out their <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">documentation</a> to learn more, but as an introduction, this should serve to get us started. </p><p>Now, let’s talk a bit about triggering deployments in Metaflow.</p><h3>Deploying models with Cortex</h3><p>In this section, I’m going to take our training flow from before and add a step for deploying our model as a production API on AWS. To do this, we’re going to use Cortex.</p><p>Cortex is a deployment platform for machine learning. On the surface, it provides simple interfaces for building prediction services, deploying them to production, and managing an inference cluster. </p><p>Under the hood, Cortex automates all of the cloud infrastructure needed for inference—autoscaling, GPU/ASIC support, load balancing, prediction tracking, etc—and implements a automated deployment process in which model serving code is packaged, versioned, and deployed to the cluster.</p><p>We can trigger a deployment using Cortex’s Python client within our training flow like this:</p><p>You’ll notice the client includes a deploy() method, which takes a configuration object for defining our API. This configuration works with the Metaflow client to extract the location of the model, and the metadata of the flow for logging purposes. Now, when we audit our deployments, we can connect it all the way back to the run that produced it, extending our lineage from data to deployment.</p><p>The configuration object also references a predict.py script, which is where the actual prediction service is defined. A Cortex predictor looks like this:</p><p>The structure is very simple. We initialize our model in the init() function, which runs on initial deployment, and we generate predictions in the predict() function. Similar to steps in Metaflow, these Python methods can contain whatever logic you want to implement.</p><p>Now, when we run the flow, the model will be trained, evaluated, and deployed to production with zero downtime or extra configuration needed. </p><p>Because Cortex provides native support for A/B testing and traffic splitting, we can even run complex deployment strategies without breaking Metaflow’s lineage.</p><p>For example, if after selecting a best model, we wanted to test how the model performed in different formats—say ONNX vs TensorFlow—we could export two versions of the model, deploy them both in an A/B test, and log their performance. Because our training flow is connected to our deployment, we can then pass this information back and forth between Cortex and Metaflow without issue.</p><h3>An easier path to production machine learning</h3><p>Over the years, a number of end-to-end data science platforms have been released, and most of them fall into the same traps:</p><ul role="list"><li>Providing a smooth interface, with zero transparency into what’s happening under the hood, killing reproducibility and auditing.</li><li>Solving one part of the stack well, like training, but “bolting on” under-developed solutions for other parts, like deployment.</li><li>Locking data scientists and machine learning engineers into a narrow stack by only supporting specific frameworks and integrations.</li></ul><p>The result is a platform that makes production machine learning easy—if you stay strictly within the confines of the system. When you have a diverse set of problems to solve, however, this is difficult to do.</p><p>Metaflow and Cortex represent a fundamentally different, human-centric approach. The emphasis is not on providing a magic solution to a narrow set of problems, but on providing an easy interface for building solutions to any problem.</p><p>If you’re interested in digging into either platform, check out the links below:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Metaflow documentation: </strong> <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">https://docs.metaflow.org/</a></li><li><strong>Metaflow GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow</a></li><li><strong>Cortex documentation: </strong><a href="https://docs.cortex.dev/" target="_blank">https://docs.cortex.dev/</a></li><li><strong>Cortex GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex</a></li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<pre>Hi,

I saw your recent discussion on running Project Oberon on RISC-V. I've been
working on a RISC-V port for the last few months, which might be
interesting to you. A port of Project Oberon to RISC-V (i.e. a RV32IM
compiler and a port of the rest of the system), as well as an emulator that
can run it, can be found in these repositories:

<a href="https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv">https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv</a>
<a href="https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv-emu">https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv-emu</a>

If you just want to try it, there's a disk image included with the emulator.

To my knowledge, this RISC-V port is more complete than others that I have
found: the compiler can compile the Oberon system as well as itself, and
the system runs well in the emulator. It lacks support for REALs and
interrupts at the moment, but most programs are able to run without them.

The port is built on top of several other Oberon-related projects, which
I've credited in oberon-riscv's readme.

I'm planning to make it run on an FPGA in the future too, although that
will have to come after the holidays.

Kind regards,
Rikke

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The Volta team is thrilled to announce that Volta 1.0.0 is now available! Volta is a fast, reliable utility for declaring your JavaScript <a href="http://calculist.org/blog/2020/12/21/tac/">Toolchains as Code</a>. In much the same way that Infrastructure as Code frees teams from manually managing their server infrastructure, <strong>Volta takes the hassle out of installing and coordinating JavaScript tools</strong>—such as Node, package managers, and package binaries—so that you can focus on creating awesome software.
<!--more--></p>



<p>The 1.0.0 release means that Volta is ready for general use in projects of all sizes. The new features included in version 1.0.0 are the last pieces in a string of work—begun with Volta 0.9.0—to make the most common tools work seamlessly with the benefits that Volta provides.</p>

<p>At the same time, 1.0.0 means more than, “we implemented some high-impact functionality and finally closed some long-standing issues.” From the beginning, Volta was built to empower engineers and engineering teams to build amazing JS applications without having to worry about their environment or tooling. For individual engineers, Volta unobtrusively makes sure your tooling is aligned with the needs of your project, allowing you to stay focused on your work. For engineering teams, Volta allows you to manage your infrastructure decision-making centrally without slowing down individual team members. When the team decides to change versions of Node, for example, that doesn’t require explicit effort on the part of each developer. With version 1.0.0, we believe Volta delivers on the promise of making tool management disappear.</p>

<p>Last, version 1.0.0 represents a commitment to stability. As we continue to add new features and support for more tools, we are committed to doing so in a backwards-compatible way. You can be confident that new releases won’t break your workflows or scripts.</p>



<h2 id="support-for-npm-link">Support for <code>npm link</code></h2>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.volta.sh/2020/10/22/announcing-volta-090/">release of Volta 0.9.0</a>, we added support for installing tools directly with your package manager while still taking advantage of the benefits that Volta provides. We have extended that support to include linking your local packages with <code>npm link</code>, even across different npm versions. Additionally, if you try to link two projects that are using different Node versions, Volta will alert you that there might be incompatibilities that cause unexpected behavior.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-upgrading-global-packages">Support for upgrading global packages</h2>

<p>You can now upgrade your installed global packages directly with your package manager, using <code>npm update -g</code> or <code>yarn global upgrade</code>. Volta will make sure that the package manager can locate all of the packages so that they can be upgraded to their latest versions.</p>



<p>While we believe that Volta 1.0.0 achieves the goals for the project, that doesn’t mean that we are done! Active development will continue on Volta: adding new features, support for new tools, and fixing any bugs that crop up. A few items on our near-term roadmap include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Native builds for Apple M1 devices</li>
  <li>Support for using <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/"><code>pnpm</code></a> as your package manager</li>
  <li>Improvements to <code>volta list</code>, making it easier to visualize the state of your tools</li>
</ul>



<p>To try Volta for the first time or upgrade your existing installation, follow the instructions on our <a href="https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started">Getting Started</a> page!</p>

<p>Finally, this release is the culmination of more than two years of work from a whole host of contributors. It wouldn’t have been possible without all of your ideas, feedback, bug reports, code, and encouragement. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone in the community for your support.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>But I made it there in the end and created a toy chess engine (<a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">healeycodes/andoma</a>) that I am proud of. It can play a game of chess and solve simple chess puzzles like mate-in-two or mate-in-three. It has a slim UCI interface which means it can be hooked up to lichess.org via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a> — a bridge between the lichess API and chess bots.</p>
<p>The first speed bump in its development was grasping the computational the complexity of chess — how fast, and wide, the search tree grows. When a chess game starts, white can open in twenty different ways and black can respond in twenty different ways also. After the first full turn, there are 400 variations possible. After the third full turn, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number#Shannon's_calculation">over 119 million</a>.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon calculated that there are around <code>10^120</code> possible games of chess in his seminal paper <em>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</em> in 1950. In <em>Rage Against the Machines</em>, Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rage-against-the-machines/">quotes</a> Diego Rasskin-Gutman, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are more possible chess games than the number of atoms in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given unlimited resources, it actually doesn’t take many lines of code to calculate every legal variation of chess. Here, the Python package <a href="https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-chess</a> is used for board representation and legal move generation.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> chess <span>import</span> Board<span>,</span> Move<span>,</span> STARTING_FEN

<p>This program throws a <code>RecursionError</code> and prints <code>59691</code> — the number of different positions the search tree contained when it crashed. All we need to fix this, is another universe to run the program in.</p>
<p>Given that there are computational limits to abide by, as well as the time control rules of chess, improvements over a naive brute force search must be made.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" aria-label="evaluation permalink"></a>Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to search for good positions, it is necessary to understand what makes a good position <em>good</em>. The most simplistic way of describing a position’s strength is to compare the total value material of each side.</p>
<p>Tomasz Michniewski, author of the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function">Simplified Evaluation Function</a>, defined some values that are “designed specifically to compensate for the lack of any other chess knowledge”. This is perfect for me — a beginner chess player.</p>
<p>This snippet sums the material on the initial board using Michniewski’s piece values.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> chess

piece_values <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    chess<span>.</span>PAWN<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>

white_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
black_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<span>for</span> square <span>in</span> chess<span>.</span>SQUARES<span>:</span>
    piece <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>piece_at<span>(</span>square<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> piece<span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>
    <span>if</span> piece<span>.</span>color <span>==</span> chess<span>.</span>WHITE<span>:</span>
        white_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        black_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Michniewski also provides <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Piece-Square_Tables">piece-square tables</a>, which alter the value of a piece depending on which square it sits on. For example, it’s better for pawns to progress up the board and it’s better for knights to be near the center of the board.</p>
<p>The bonus of a square may be positive, neutral, or negative. The piece-square tables are presented from White’s POV and must be mirrored for Black.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># a knight's bonuses depending on square
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,
-40,-20,  0,  0,  0,  0,-20,-40,
-30,  0, 10, 15, 15, 10,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 15, 20, 20, 15,  5,-30,
-30,  0, 15, 20, 20, 15,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 10, 15, 15, 10,  5,-30,
-40,-20,  0,  5,  5,  0,-20,-40,
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,</code></pre></div>
<p>For the king, Michniewski provides two tables — one for the middle game and one for the end game. He defines the end game as being either if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both sides have no queens or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every side which has a queen has additionally no other pieces or one minorpiece maximum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evaluation of a chess board is one of the things that’s kept me interested in chess engines. Evaluation rules are easy to add and take away. I refactored the code from Go to Python to be able to prototype different rules faster.</p>
<p>After piece-square tables, one might look at pawn structure, mobility, center control, connectivity, trapped pieces, king safety, space, tempo, and other patterns (this list is taken from the Chess Programming Wiki’s <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation">Evaluation</a> page).</p>
<h2 id="searching-with-minimax"><a href="#searching-with-minimax" aria-label="searching with minimax permalink"></a>Searching With Minimax</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> is a search algorithm that finds the next optimal move by minimizing the potential loss in a worst case scenario. Chess is a game of perfect information — by looking at the board it’s possible to know exactly what an opponent is capable of. However, this search for moves is limited by the evaluation function and the depth that computing resources are able to reach.</p>
<p>The search space is a tree of legal moves which grows exponentially at every level (the average branching factor is around 35). By the time the tree is explored, the path to many future boards is known as well as which path restricts the opponent’s possible gains the most.</p>
<p>The leaf nodes of the tree return the evaluation of their current state. Non-leaf nodes inherit their value from a descendant node. Eventually, the recursive function reduces down to a value for the given board.</p>
<p>This function can be used to pick the next best move by calling it on every legal move available in the current turn. A great visual resource for this algorithm is Sebastian Lague’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">Algorithms Explained – minimax and alpha-beta pruning</a>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>minimax</span><span>(</span>board<span>,</span> depth<span>,</span> maximizing_player<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<h2 id="alpha-beta-pruning"><a href="#alpha-beta-pruning" aria-label="alpha beta pruning permalink"></a>Alpha-beta pruning</h2>
<p>My chess engine uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a> as an improvement over the naive minimax algorithm — which does not fare well against the exponential nature of chess. Branches of the search tree can be eliminated when it is clear that another branch shows more promise. This significantly reduces the number of moves required to be generated.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/a99200aacf6d6cfc643aaa45317d65aa/42a19/alpha-beta-pruning.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>By reducing the depth of branches that will not bear fruit we can search deeper down the better parts of the tree.</p>
<p>The speed of alpha-beta pruning can be increased by applying <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Ordering">move ordering</a>. This is where the more promising branches of the search tree are searched first — which means less time is spent in the worst branches as they will be cut off early.</p>
<p>Move ordering cannot be 100% accurate but it’s a powerful optimization.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">my engine</a>, a cheap (but not perfect) <code>move_value</code> function is used to sort the initial legal move nodes from best to worst. The logic of this function is capture in its docstring:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>'''
How good is a move?
A promotion is great.
A weaker piece taking a stronger piece is good.
A stronger piece taking a weaker piece is bad.
Also consider the position change via piece-square table.
'''</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="communication-and-the-uci-protocol"><a href="#communication-and-the-uci-protocol" aria-label="communication and the uci protocol permalink"></a>Communication and the UCI Protocol</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma/blob/main/uci-interface.md">Universal Chess Interface</a> (UCI) is a open protocol to hook up chess engines to user interfaces. The communication is done through standard input and standard output and messages end with <code>\n</code>. The move format is long algebraic notation — like <code>e2e4</code>, or <code>e1g1</code> for white short castling, and an example of a promotion to queen is <code>a7a8q</code>.</p>
<p>There are many configuration commands in the specification and it initially seemed overwhelming. After debugging, I found that not many were required to get a chess engine to the <em>Hello World</em> stage.</p>
<p>In order to hook my chess engine up to lichess via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a>, I implemented the following. These commands are send to the engine from lichess-bot:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uci</code> - the engine reports its name, authors, and <code>uciok</code></li>
<li><code>isready</code> - the engine reports that it’s ready: <code>readyok</code></li>
<li><code>position startpos moves e2e4</code> - the engine sets it’s internal state to match the list of moves</li>
<li><code>go</code> - the engine should now calculate and respond with the next best move, like <code>g8f6</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-promise"><a href="#a-promise" aria-label="a promise permalink"></a>A Promise</h2>
<p>I have found a great joy interacting with the chess community over the last month. Lichess is a fantastic resource and endlessly fun to play on. The UI is slick and light — and the post-match analysis is revealing and simple to use. It’s <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/lila">open source</a> and relies on donations and sponsorships.</p>
<p>I took breaks from writing this article to play chess against Dad on a real board. We’re missing a white rook and use a pencil sharpener as a replacement piece. He has been telling me stories about playing chess decades ago — before IBM’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a> emerged and beat Garry Kasparov, the reigning world champion, on its second attempt in 1997.</p>
<p>If you are within my social circle, you will have experienced me evangelizing chess and chess engines over the last month — now that I have published this, I promise to chill out a little bit ♟️</p>

<p>So, this <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-and-european-commission-inaugurate-new-decryption-platform-to-tackle-challenge-of-encrypted-material-for-law-enforcement">press release</a> just dropped:</p>



<hr>



<blockquote><p>This week Europol launched an innovative decryption platform, developed in close cooperation with the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en" target="_blank">European Commission’s Joint Research Centre</a>. It will significantly increase Europol’s capability to decrypt information lawfully obtained in criminal investigations.</p><p>The launch of the new decryption platform marks a milestone in the fight against organised crime and terrorism in Europe. In full respect of fundamental rights and without limiting or weakening encryption, this initiative will be available to national law enforcement authorities of all Member States to help keep societies and citizens safe and secure. A virtual inauguration ceremony brought together senior representatives from Europol, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en" target="_blank">European Parliament</a>, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/" target="_blank">Council of the EU</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" target="_blank">Commission</a>.</p><cite><a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-and-european-commission-inaugurate-new-decryption-platform-to-tackle-challenge-of-encrypted-material-for-law-enforcement">https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-and-european-commission-inaugurate-new-decryption-platform-to-tackle-challenge-of-encrypted-material-for-law-enforcement</a></cite></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>Now my gut reaction when anyone refers to “the launch of a new platform” with glowing descriptions and prescriptive outlook, is to remember Geoffrey James’ “Tao of Programming” – but this is more important than mere nerd flippancy, and so worthy of some deeper consideration. </p>



<p>The announcement continues:</p>



<hr>



<blockquote><p>Europol’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a>&nbsp;will operate the platform and leverage its in-house expertise in providing the most effective support to national Member State investigations.</p><cite>q.v.</cite></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>…which links to a <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">fairly terrifying page</a>, with some particularly egregious military-code-word-security-cyber-spooky-stuff:</p>

<hr>



<p>So, basically, this sounds something along the lines of <em>“we bought a whole pile of GPUs and/or rented them from somewhere, and we’re announcing it before Christmas so that people know that we are <strong>‘doing something about cyber™’</strong>“</em></p>



<p>But why would that be interesting? Why announce something? And why now?</p>



<p><strong>Gut feeling</strong>, followed by a <strong>wild, unsubstantiated guess</strong>: this is not a capability which one would normally announce. Stuff like this is very nerdy, and best kept in-house. Therefore it is being announced for a “soft goal”, done for the sake of being seen to be done. </p>



<p>What’s a good soft goal? Well, based upon my corporate (rather than Government) experience, there are two obvious options:</p>



<ol><li>“We have budget that we have to spend, and which we have to be seen to be spending, so that we can get the same or increased budget, next year”; or, more interestingly…</li><li>Someone with an ounce of sense regarding strategic face-saving, is looking at all the European Commission-led brouhaha regarding <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/">“We need to have good security IN SPITE of good security, oh, wait, did I say security? I meant ‘encryption’, of course”</a> – and  is announcing this in order to have a face-saving programme in the (likely? I hope likely) instance that all of that political sound and fury, comes to nothing.</li></ol>



<p>Number 2 is particularly interesting to me because the European Commission is called-out on the press release headline; I can’t imagine that as happening on a more mundane, geek- or budget-led press release. Hence thinking that the EC want to be seen to be taking a diversity of approaches towards encryption. </p>



<p>Maybe I am wrong, so perhaps someone who knows more about the operations of Europol press releases, can comment? Anonymously, via Strong Encryption and Tor, if desired?</p>

<h2 id="foreword"><a href="#foreword" aria-label="foreword permalink"></a>Foreword</h2>
<p>Welcome to the second issue of the <em>eBPF Updates</em>! This time we have
interesting resources about how to write eBPF programs with Zig, or with Rust,
or on how to manage them with libbpf. On the kernel side, modules now support
BTF, and improvements to memory accounting for eBPF should help to solve the
limitations of rlimit. Did this just sound incomprehensible to you? Do not
fear, we also have some gentle introductions to eBPF in the list. This issue
also introduces a “Did You Know” section, and this time the focus is on CO-RE.
Read, learn, trace, and filter!</p>
<h2 id="important-news"><a href="#important-news" aria-label="important news permalink"></a>Important News</h2>
<p>The calls for participation (CFPs) for the devrooms for

<li><a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/the-top-reasons-why-you-should-give-ebpf-a-chance"><em>The Top Reasons Why You Should Give eBPF a Chance</em></a>,
from Lucas Severo Alves.<br>
Several factors are responsible for eBPF's success and should make readers
consider learning about, or using, this technology. This post cites its
powerful tracing capabilities, with the ability to attach to nearly any
function in the kernel with little impact on performance. Another reason is
that more and more companies, including large ones, are adopting eBPF; a
detailed list follows. At last, eBPF makes it possible to quickly develop
tools to instrument new parts of the kernel, without the need to go through a
longer process to upstream new attach points.</li>
<li><a href="https://cmd.com/blog/making-bpf-easy-with-libbpf-and-zig/"><em>Making BPF easy with libbpf and Zig</em></a>,
from Matt Knight.<br>
The <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> programming language is used to create and
handle a simple eBPF program in this tutorial, both for the user space loader
and the eBPF program itself. The objective is mostly to understand how libbpf
manipulates the ELF object containing a program in order to load it, but
compiling from Zig, which aims at competing with C while offering some newer
features, may open new perspectives. The code is available
<a href="https://github.com/mattnite/zig-bpf-intro">on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/13943">Weight support for Cilium's eBPF-based Maglev load balancer implementation</a>,
from Fankaixi Li.<br>
A new pull request by a software engineer at ByteDance (TikTok) popped up,
adding weight support to the eBPF-based
<a href="https://cilium.io/blog/2020/11/10/cilium-19#maglev">Maglev implementation in Cilium</a>.
Maglev provides consistent hashing for high-availability scenarios, and
balance packets to the same backends even if they arrive at different load
balancing nodes. The feature adds the possibility to assign weights to favor
some backends. It is still being discussed, but should land soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/ekDR/beyond-the-buzzword-bpfs-unexpected-role-in-kubernetes-andrew-randall-alban-crequy-kinvolk"><em>Beyond the Buzzword: BPF’s Unexpected Role in Kubernetes</em></a>,
from Andrew Randall and Alban Crequy.<br>
After a high-level overview of eBPF, this presentation depicts the landscape
of the projects gravitating around this technology. The authors explain that
there are many powerful tools based on eBPF, although none of them would
cover Kubernetes clusters. As an answer to fill the gap, they introduce
Inspektor Gadget, which reuses some elements from the bcc tools to provide a
new set of monitoring gadgets for examining Pods. Note that the wording in
the slides might be misleading: If there was no equivalent to bcc for tracing
containers before Inspektor Gadget, there <em>are</em> other tools targeting the
platform, such as Cilium/Hubble for network and observability or BPFd for
running bcc scripts in containers.</li>
<li><a href="https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/"><em>TIL: eBPF is awesome</em></a>,
from Filip Nikolovski.<br>
We all agree on this! This post is a gentle introduction to eBPF. A bit of
history, some details on the core infrastructure and its components, and a
simple “Hello, World!” example extracted from
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/34cada17f798b8e00268d1ba4a4a8d765b948532/examples/tracing/hello_fields.py">the bcc tools</a>.
A nice read if you just got started with eBPF.</li>
<li><a href="https://suchakra.wordpress.com/2020/11/20/building-an-esoteric-filesystem-tracing-tool-with-ebpf/"><em>Building an Esoteric Filesystem Tracing Tool with eBPF</em></a>,
from Suchakra Sharma.<br>
This post has a focus on the read-ahead mechanism in the Linux kernel. After
providing a refresher on how read-ahead works, Suchakra explains in details
how eBPF can monitor the hit rate and efficiency of this mechanism. It turns
out that the program used to do that already exists in two versions, one with
a mix of C and Python proper to the bcc tools, and another one based on
libbpf and the newer features brought by the library, like CO-RE (Compile
Once, Run Everywhere). The last section details the benefits of the latter
version and the motivations to port tools to libbpf.</li>
<li><a href="https://lac2020.sciencesconf.org/data/proceedings.pdf#section*.12"><em>eXpress Data Path Kernel Objects for Real-Time Audio Streaming Optimization</em></a> (PDF),
from Christoph Kuhr and Alexander Carôt.<br>
Focusing on audio packet processing, this work aims at facilitating the set
up of a rehearsal environment for conducted orchestras via the Internet with
up to sixty musicians. The system may be susceptible to latency issues when
the different UDP streams must be processed and combined. The authors
investigated the use of XDP for processing these UDP streams, aggregating
them in the kernel and reporting only the final audio sample to the user
application. The authors found that XDP was not ideal, because of its lack of
floating-point operations and because it does not permit to retrieve hardware
timestamps. They were also limited by the incompatibility between LLVM, used
to compile the eBPF programs, and their build system, and could not
experiment on one part of their frontend. And although XDP increased the
performance, they realized that they could obtain similar speeds for their
use case with an optimized handling of a generic raw socket. Still, the use
case and experiment remain an interesting read.<br>
Video of the presentation may be available in the future from
<a href="https://lac2020.sciencesconf.org/">the page of the conference</a>, if it gets
uploaded.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/primer-how-xdp-and-ebpf-speed-network-traffic-via-the-linux-kernel/"><em>Primer: How XDP and eBPF Speed Network Traffic via the Linux Kernel</em></a>,
from Jack Wallen.<br>
There is a resolute focus on XDP in this article which describes how this
eBPF hook can speed up network traffic on Linux. This is followed by a simple
tutorial, where bcc is used to attach a XDP program and to track UDP packets
sent to a given port.</li>
<li><a href="https://nakryiko.com/posts/libbpf-bootstrap/"><em>Building BPF applications with libbpf-boostrap</em></a>,
from Andrii Nakryiko.<br>
You want to start developing an eBPF application, but you feel intimidated by
libbpf's complexity or lack of documentation? You <em>must</em> have a look at
libbpf-bootstrap. This project builds simple application templates, on which
you can directly build your software. Of the two available templates, the
simplest one (<code>minimal</code>) manipulates an eBPF program that simply logs the PID
of the process that calls it. The more advanced template (<code>bootstrap</code>) sets
up an application with more advanced features like eBPF maps, read-only
configuration variables, eBPF ring buffer, or CO-RE which needs a BTF (BPF
Type Format) description of the kernel's internals. This means that using
these features gets simple and immediate, all is set up for you in the
template. This article goes into a thorough description of the mechanisms
involved. This is a long read, but well worth it if you want to program
applications working with eBPF.</li>
<li><a href="https://pluginized-protocols.org/xbgp/2020/11/29/xbgp-hello.html"><em>A first xBGP plugin</em></a>,
from Thomas Wirtgen.<br>
As a follow-up from the link to the paper for xBGP in the previous issue of
these <em>eBPF Updates</em>, this is the introduction of a first eBPF-based xBGP
plugin. The idea is that, quoting the post, “<em>a network operator would like
to ignore the BGP UPDATE messages that contain an unknown attribute. A
practical example of this usage is when problems with the processing of BGP
Path attribute 128 caused the failure of BGP sessions</em>”. All steps required
for running this example are provided. The code is hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/xbgp_plugins.git">GitHub</a>, but there
is also a
<a href="https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/libxbgp/blob/master/misc/Dockerfile_xbgp">Dockerfile</a>
packaging all the required elements.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cB4rJcdxTolIIUy5IEcb9iiUJHlMNmyT7c5eYY9D5LU/edit?usp=sharing"><em>Cilium &amp; eBPF - From Device to Service-Centric Networking</em></a>,
from Thomas Graf.<br>
In this presentation at the NAG (Network Architecture Geeks) Cafe in
December, Thomas outlines how eBPF allows to build powerful service-centric
networking models and how to evolve away from the old device-centric
networking architecture to meet requirements of containers and cloud-native
environments.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/simplestaking/integrating-an-ebpf-based-firewall-into-the-tezedge-node-with-multipass-validations-769d4c6ccd93"><em>Integrating an eBPF-based firewall into the TezEdge node with multipass validations</em></a>,
from Juraj Selep.<br>
TezEdge peer-to-peer nodes validate blocks for the decentralized
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos">Tezos</a> blockchain, providing smart
contracts. Blockchain networks are subject to DDoS (Distributed Denial of
Service) attacks, generally mitigated with a firewall. In the current case,
XDP is used to implement it. The eBPF program checks that each connection
starts with a valid and unique proof of work, making it expensive for an
adversary to start many connections. This is further integrated with the
“multipass validation” scheme that aims at detecting erroneous blocks as soon
as possible. Note that the eBPF programs are written in Rust.</li>

from Wenbo Zhang.<br>
Another article on the benefits brought by CO-RE, for which libbpf provides
good support. After comparing bcc-based and libbpf-based tracing tools in
terms of features and memory footprint, the author provide a list of tools
and invocation patterns they use to analyze I/O performance.</li>

This framework does not use prior world knowledge or modeling assumptions, can directly optimize for any socioeconomic objective, and learns from observable data alone.</li><li>Our experiments show the AI Economist can improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by 16%, compared to a prominent tax framework proposed by Emmanuel Saez, with even larger gains over an adaptation of the US Federal income tax and the free market. </li><li>Without endorsing this particular schedule, it is interesting that the AI Economist implements qualitatively different tax schedules than the baselines, with higher top tax rates and lower rates for middle incomes. Furthermore, it is robust in the face of emergent tax gaming strategies.</li><li>Moreover, the AI Economist is effective in simulations with human participants, achieving competitive equality-productivity trade-offs with the baselines and significantly higher income-weighted average social welfare. This suggests promise in using this approach to improve social outcomes in real economies.</li><li>Our vision for the AI Economist is to enable an objective study of policy impact on real-world economies, at a level of complexity that traditional economic research cannot easily address. We believe the intersection of machine learning and economics presents a wide range of exciting research directions, and gives ample opportunity for machine learning to have positive social impact.</li></ul><p>Our work fits within a larger context of recent advances in RL. RL has been used to train AIs to win competitive games, such as Go, Dota, and Starcraft. In those settings, the RL objective is inherently adversarial (â€œbeat-the-other-teamâ€�). Machine learning has also been used for the design of auction rules. In this work, we instead focus on the opportunity to use AI to promote social welfare through the design of optimal tax policies in dynamic economies.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="the-challenge-of-optimal-tax-design">The Challenge of Optimal Tax Design</h2><p>Many studies have shown that high income inequality can negatively impact economic growth and economic opportunity. Taxes can help reduce inequality, but it is hard to find the optimal tax policy. Economic theory cannot fully model the complexities of the real world. Instead, tax theory relies on simplifying assumptions that are hard to validate, for example, about the effect of taxes on how much people work. Moreover, real-world experimentation with taxes is almost impossible.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

A worker gains utility from income but incurs the cost of labor effort. At some point, the extra utility from additional income does not outweigh the cost of additional effort. </p><p><em>For instance, working on weekends might earn you more money, but the effort might not be worth it to you.</em></p><p>A key assumption is that people differ in their <strong>skill</strong> level. Low-skilled workers receive a lower hourly wage, and so earn less money than high-skilled workers for the same amount of labor. This leads to inequality.</p><h3 id="the-central-tax-dilemma">The Central Tax Dilemma</h3><p>As a policy goal, a government may prefer to tax and redistribute income in order to improve equality. However, higher taxation can discourage work and may particularly affect high-skilled workers. An optimal tax policy optimizes this balance between equality and productivity. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/04/figure-5-4.png"><figcaption>An illustrative view of how taxes can impact social outcomes. Left: Taxes can improve equality by transferring income. However, taxes can also decrease productivity, because they can discourage work. The AI Economist seeks a tax policy that optimizes this trade-off. The Pareto boundary is the set of maximal trade-offs. Right: Taxes impact productivity (total income, represented by the area of the big squares), and equality (the relative difference in sizes of the smaller squares). In this illustration, the AI Economist achieves the best trade-off.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A prominent tax framework, proposed by Emmanuel Saez, derives a simple optimal tax formula. However, this formula requires knowing how labor responds to changes in tax rates (â€œelasticityâ€�) and makes strong assumptions, for example, that the economy is static and workers do not gain new skills. Other work has studied dynamic economic systems, but needs simplifying assumptions in order to attain analytical solutions.

It uses a principled economic simulation with both workers and a policy maker (a "planner" in the economics literature), all of whom are collectively learning<strong> </strong>using reinforcement learning. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/04/freemarket-ai-1.gif"><figcaption>Left: Economic simulation in which four agents collect and trade resources, build houses and earn income.

The trade-off between equality and productivity is measured by multiplying equality and productivity.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h3 id="gathering-trading-and-building">Gathering, Trading and Building</h3><p>The simulation uses a two-dimensional world. There are two types of resources: wood and stone. Resources are scarce: they appear in the world at a limited rate. Workers move around, gather and trade resources, and earn income by building houses (this costs stone and wood). Houses block access: workers cannot move through the houses built by others. The simulation runs this economy over the course of an episode, which is analogous to a â€œworking career.â€� </p><h3 id="skill-and-utility">Skill and Utility</h3><p>A key feature is that workers have different skills<strong>. </strong>Higher-skilled workers earn more income for building houses, and thus more utility. Building houses also takes effort, which lowers utility. Workers also pay income taxes and the collected tax is redistributed evenly among the workers. Together, these economic factors and the various competitive drivers mean that workers need to be strategic in order to maximize their utility. </p><h3 id="emergent-specialization">Emergent Specialization</h3><p>Our economic simulation produces rich behavior when AI agents (the agents are the workers in the economy) learn to maximize their utility. A salient feature is specialization: AI agents with lower skill become <strong>gatherer-and-sellers </strong>and earn income by collecting and selling stone and wood. Agents with higher skill specialize as <strong>buyer-and-builders</strong> and purchase stone and wood in order to more quickly build houses. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/04/group-embed.svg"><figcaption>Top: The state of the simulation over the course of a single play-through.

Rather, specialization emerges because differently skilled workers learn to balance their income and effort. This demonstrates the richness of the economic simulation and builds trust that agents respond to economic drivers. Complex emergent economic behavior has been previously studied in economics through agent-based modeling, but this has largely proceeded without the benefit of recent advances in AI.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

              <div>
              <p>Haskell has a stigma of having poor or no documentation at all. Though more and more maintainers are doing a hell of a job to improve the quality of their libraries and applications, it is still not enough. We need to strengthen our vision of documentation collectively and as a consequence, master the existing tools for doing that.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">different types of documentation</a>. Today we want to talk about API and libraries documentation inside your library, and accordingly about Haskell gear for that – <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post is going to give Haddock overview, suggest documentation best practices, reveal the specialities of the Haddock tool, and show-and-tell lots of different examples of how to squeeze more out of your documentation. It should be interesting to library maintainers, developers who want to improve their documenting skills and everyone interested in documentation techniques in Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-haddock">What is Haddock<a href="#what-is-haddock">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Haddock is the Haskell way to document exposed API of your library or application. Writing special comments alongside your code helps to keep code and documentation synchronised and up-to-date (as outdated documentation is a painful problem to deal with). It also makes the docs comfy both for maintainers and users. And Haddock provides precisely that. Haskell is not always beginner-friendly, so giving a helping hand to users of your code in a convenient way is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>You write documentation using the special Haddock markup language right near the structures you want to document, and it can be rendered to different formats, including styled HTML, that could be viewable later on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a>, <a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> or even locally. Moreover, if you upload your library to Hackage or Stackage, <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> will search for definitions by name or type across all packages, including yours.</p>
<p>Here is how a typical Haddock documentation page for a module looks like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-membrain.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Module Example</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To produce the documentation, Haddock needs to build the project first because it uses build-time information. But you don’t need to worry about it usually, because build tools do that automatically when you ask them to output documentation.</p>

<p>Haddock is written in Haskell comments with the special annotations. There are two types of Haddock marked comments – <strong>pre-</strong> (starting with the <code>|</code> symbol) and <strong>post-comments</strong> (starting with the <code>^</code> symbol), which means that Haddock comments could be put right before or after the function/type/class definitions.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- | I am the 'foo' function's Haddock pre-comment.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>bar ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>-- ^ I am the 'bar' function's Haddock post-comment</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For multi-line Haddock comments you can use either <strong>per-line</strong> or <strong>block</strong> style comments for both pre and post types. The special Haddock symbol needs to be added just to the first line of the multi-line comment, and Haddock will consume following lines until the first non-comment line.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- | This is multiline</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>-- per-line Haddock pre-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"></span>
<span id="cb2-5"></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><span>bar ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- ^ Another per-line Haddock</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>-- post-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"></span>
<span id="cb2-10"><span>{- | Multiline Haddock</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><span>block pre-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><span>-}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><span>baz ::</span> <span>Double</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you write multi-line comments in your code, we strongly advise using <strong>block</strong> comments by default over per-line ones because of the number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are fewer chances to lose part of your documentation due to the extra newline with multiline comments syntax, unlike per-line comments. Remember, that Haddock consumes comments marked as documentation until the first non-comment line, and a newline without <code>--</code> separates such comments into ordinary independent groups.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>-- | I am a normal line of documentation.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>-- I will be in the docs too.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span>-- I am not going to make it due to the missing @--@ in the previous line.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>As a consequence, it’s impossible to have conditional documentation chunks under the <a href="https://guide.aelve.com/haskell/cpp-vww0qd72">C Preprocessor (CPP)</a> pragmas when using the <code>--</code> style of comments, as CPP pragmas are stripped to empty lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiline comments contain less noise (no <code>--</code> on each line), making it easier to read and update.</p></li>
<li><p>They are more suitable for inserting/copying/updating code snippets quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>They also occupy less space horizontally on average, because you don’t waste 3 characters on each line.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-be-documented">What can be documented<a href="#what-can-be-documented">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Generally, Haddock documents the exposed API of your Haskell libraries and applications.</p>
<p>More specifically, Haddock can be applied to document the following parts of the Haskell code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-level module headers</li>
<li>Type definitions: <code>data</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>newtype</code></li>
<li>Constructors and fields</li>
<li>Typeclasses — <code>class</code> declarations</li>
<li>Typeclasses methods</li>
<li>Instances</li>
<li>Derived typeclasses</li>
<li>Top-level functions</li>
<li>Arguments and return results of functions</li>
<li>More exotic top-level definitions: <code>pattern</code>, <code>type family</code>, <code>data family</code>, <code>type instance</code> and <code>data instance</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The below example showcases some Haddock syntax and features:</p>

<p>When documentation is built, it will look like on the screenshot below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-overall-example.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Overall Example</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr>
<p>We don’t recommend using the Haddock comment syntax for other places where they cannot be applied by specification because this breaks Haddock. Even though the documentation states that such comments should be ignored, it is not what you would get on the output.</p>
<p>For example, the following innocent-looking Haddock results in the documentation error:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>-- ^ The answer</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>Haddock coverage:

src/BlogpostHaddock.hs:57:10: error:
    parse error on input '-- ^ The answer'
   |
57 | var = 42 -- ^ The answer
   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>This issue will prevent the documentation appearing at Hackage and Stackage, which means that users won’t be able to read package documentation easily or search by the package in Hoogle.</p>
<p>Correct documentation looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-- ^ The answer</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you wanted to leave an ordinary (non-documentation) comment:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>-- The answer</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>We are not going to cover all annotation syntax. You can learn more from the <a href="https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">official documentation</a>. Instead, we will try to focus on best practices, advice and more explanation of suitability and usability of some various pieces of documentation on different levels.</p>
<h2 id="haddock-fishing">Haddock Fishing<a href="#haddock-fishing">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As most of us are looking at the libraries’ documentation through Hackage/Stackage/Haddock or local options of the same format, we are going to cover each layer of the documentation on the page piece by piece from top to bottom and see how we can use 100% of each element.</p>
<p>Every page is responsible for one Haskell module and correspondingly reflects its structure, though in a user-configurable way (we will cover later the ways to take control over that). So, with respect to that, let’s start diving into the meaning of each and every documentation piece.</p>
<div>
<p>Though, sometimes you are interested only in specific types and functions, not in reading the full documentation. Hackage helps here as well. You can press the <kbd>s</kbd> button on a package page to quickly jump to definitions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-relude-search.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Search Example</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<h3 id="top-level">Top Level<a href="#top-level">🔗</a></h3>
<p>First thing you see on the module documentation page is this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-top-level-header.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock top-level header</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This whole information is taken from the top-level Haddock comment for the module. The comment is attached to the <code>module</code> construction in the source file. You can put extensions (<code>{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}</code>) and options (e.g.&nbsp;<code>{-# OPTIONS_GHC ... #-}</code>) either <em>before</em> the module header comment or <em>after</em>, but we recommend putting module Haddock comment closer to the module keyword itself, <strong>after</strong> all language extensions and module-specific options.</p>
<p>So the module layout may look like this:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications    #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>{- | ... Module header comment</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><span>module</span> <span>MyModule</span> (<span>...</span>) <span>where</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>The meta-information in the border to the right is the result of special annotations at the beginning of the top-level Haddock. If it isn’t present in the file, then none will be shown in there (except for automatically determined info by the tool you are using).</p>
<p>These annotations include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Module</code> – Module name</li>
<li><code>Description</code> – Short description</li>
<li><code>Copyright</code> – Copyright note (preserves newlines)</li>
<li><code>License</code> or <code>Licence</code> or <code>SPDX-License-Identifier</code> – the name of the license used in the project</li>
<li><code>Maintainer</code> – information about current maintainer, can include email</li>
<li><code>Stability</code> – <em>experimental</em> or <em>stable</em></li>
<li><code>Portability</code> – <em>portable</em> or <em>non-portable</em>, but you can put anything basically. This field meaning is not strictly defined. Some people use it for OS-portability and write something like POSIX, Windows, portable. Other people mean “the Haskell compiler according to standard portability” and put “non-portable” here if a module uses GHC-only extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Auto-filled, no manual fill-in is possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Safe Haskell</code> – <code>Safe</code>, <code>Trustworthy</code>, <code>Unsafe</code> or <code>None</code> (default)</li>
<li><code>Language</code> – Haskell report: 98 or 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the fields are optional, in free format and don’t have any requirements. Adding this header to each module is advisable.</p>

         <p> 特斯拉最大勁敵來了，蘋果首款電動車「Apple Car」將提前問世。供應鏈透露，蘋果比照iPhone備料由零組件開始催貨的慣例，近期向和大（1536）、貿聯-KY、和勤、富田等台灣汽車零組件廠提出備貨要求，將相關業者入列首波供應鏈。</p>
         <!--1-->
         
         <p> 台灣關鍵供應鏈證實，蘋果預計明年9月發表Apple Car，比原先規劃提早至少兩年，其原型車已經在美國加州上路測試，因應Apple Car拉貨需求，和大、貿聯等台廠忙翻天，全面爆單。 </p>

         <p> 儘管遭點名的台廠都相當低調，但近期已有不少國內汽車零組件廠開始「動起來」，透露Apple Car大單將至的訊息。其中，和大位於嘉義大埔美園區的新廠，正加速AI智能化產線布建，明年第2季將可新增六條產線投產。</p>
         <!--3-->
         
         <p> 和勤也積極進行兩岸擴產，台灣全興廠預計年底完成搬遷及量產，嘉興和新廠第五車間擴廠訂明年第2季完成搬遷。</p>
         <!--4-->
         
         <p> 富田位於銅鑼的二期廠預計明年投產，一、二期廠電動車動力馬達零組件產能，可由目前的每年40萬套，一舉拉升至100萬套，動力集成系統則增至40萬套以上。</p>
         <!--5-->
         
         <p> 業界指出，除了電動車龍頭特斯拉之外，國內電動車供應鏈最近出現一個新的發燒名詞「美國雙A」，積極向台廠下單。</p>
         <!--6-->
         
         <p> 儘管供應鏈廠商都簽署保密協定，不願透露細節，但知情的業者坦言，「美國雙A」指的就是蘋果（Apple）與亞馬遜（Amazon）兩家廠商，業者暱稱為「一個大A，一個小A」。</p>
         <!--7-->
         
         <p> 蘋果對電動車的進度始終秘而不宣，外界原本預期，至少到2023年才會發表Apple Car。不過，國內供應鏈大廠董座直言，客戶規劃Apple Car明年9月將發表；另外，亞馬遜與Rivian合作的電動貨卡車，明年8月搶先問世，關鍵供應鏈也都是台廠。</p>
         <!--8-->
         
         <p> 電動車供應鏈大廠高層透露，隨著訂單出貨、組裝完成，Apple Car首款原型車，已有數十輛秘密在美國加州上路測試中，預料放量出貨與商機效益明年發酵，2022年全面爆發。</p>
         <!--9-->
         
         <p> 另外，電動車新創公司Rivian，去年獲得亞馬遜10萬輛電動貨車訂單，雙方密切研發客製化純電小貨車，相關零組件也是倚靠台灣供應鏈，新車預計明年8月在美國上路，2022年在全球開始服務。</p>
         <!--10-->
         
         <p> 據了解，配合特斯拉增產，以及「美國雙A」等新客戶的加入，國內主要電動車供應鏈包括和大、貿聯、和勤、富田等都出現「爆單」的情形，並積極擴廠、擴產。</p>
         <!--11-->
         
         <p> 值得注意的是，上銀集團也加速布局電動車領域，目前正與歐洲及中國大陸電動車零件大廠洽談客製化智慧滾珠螺桿，最快明年底前開始出貨，主要用於電動車轉向與剎車系統。</p>

</div><div>
<p>Such are images of hope: Nurses getting vaccinated. Pallets of packaged vaccines distributed on special flights. Mayors exulting over "the beginning of the end of the pandemic.” A president who is preparing the country for better times.</p>


<div>
<p>These images are from the United States.</p><p>In Germany, on the other hand, you see desolate shopping streets, shuttered restaurants and a government that is preparing its population for long, dark days.</p><p>The contrast is unmistakable. On the one hand, there is the supposedly incompetent Trump administration, which will provide vaccines to 20 million Americans in the next two to three weeks alone. By the end of March, the plan is for around 100 million Americans to have received the two vaccine injections they need.</p><p>On the other hand, there is the supposedly well-prepared Europeans, who continue to have to wait for a vaccine that was developed in Germany. And who still don’t know exactly how much of the vaccine they will be getting in the coming months.</p>
</div>

<p>Initially, Germany’s health minister has announced, there will probably only be 400,000 vaccine doses for Germany, with another 11 to 13 million to follow by March -- a fraction of the amount the Americans are getting.</p>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<p>It’s a politically dangerous situation that has now been recognized by the German government. Since last week, it has been taking hectic countermeasures. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) now wants to approve the vaccine a week earlier than planned, and vaccinations are slated to begin in Europe on Dec. 27. Negotiations are also underway with manufacturers to obtain more doses. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel even spoke with BioNTech founders Özlem Türeci and Uğur Șahin in a livestream, part of which was broadcast publicly. The message couldn’t be any clearer: Vaccination is now the chancellor’s business.</p>

<div>
<p>That realization has come too late, however. For months, it has been clear that other countries would have more doses of the vaccine, would start vaccinating sooner and, as a result, would be able to take more effective action against the pandemic.</p><p>But in Berlin and at European Union headquarters in Brussels, too little action was taken for too long, and it was often justified with complacent arguments: In Europe, medicines are tested better and more precisely than elsewhere in the world, and vaccines are available in abundance thanks to good planning. Health Minister Jens Spahn announced that the critical mass of around 60 percent of the German population could be vaccinated.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Too Little, Too Late</h3><p>But, so far at least, his optimism hasn’t been matched by reality.</p><p>And the late approval of the active ingredient in the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) appears to be the least of the problems. The bigger issue is that if the situation remains as it is now, there will not be enough vaccine available to get the pandemic under control in Germany before next autumn. The EU appears to have bought too little, too late and at times from the wrong producers. And it appears that it turned down hundreds of millions of vaccine doses that are now lacking.</p><p>Dramatic consequences are brewing for the German government: Without being able to vaccinate on a broad scale, the country won’t be able to stop the virus. Which means that the fall and winter of 2021 could be similar to this year, with high infection rates, contact restrictions and lockdowns. The only remedy would be a massive increase in the number of vaccines that are approved for use.</p><p>But Berlin has made an uncompromising commitment to European solidarity on the vaccination issue. And that means it’s not only the influential and economically strong member states that will have access, but also smaller countries like Romania and Slovenia. If Germany were to go out on its own and buy up vaccine doses that are in short supply, it would massively threaten cohesion in a Europe that is already fragile.</p><p>At the same time, though, the German federal government has an obligation to do all it can to protect its people.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Scientists estimate that 60 to 70 percent of Germany’s population would need to be vaccinated in order to stop the virus. That would require 100 to 120 million doses because, with one exception, all the vaccines currently available have to be administered in two doses before they deliver immunity.</p><p>The EU has ordered a total of 1.3 billion doses from six different manufacturers. Germany is entitled to 18.6 percent of those doses in a distribution mechanism calculated according to its share of the EU population. That amounts to around 250 million doses. But the number is misleading.</p><p>Currently, the only deliveries that are certain are those from German-American consortium BioNTech/Pfizer and the American biotech company Moderna.</p><p>BioNTech, whose vaccine is to be approved by the EU on Dec. 21, will be able to supply around 45 million doses to Germany in the first half of the year, according to current estimates. Moderna, whose vaccine is due to be authorized for use in Europe on Jan. 6, could supply around 15 million doses. Together, that’s a total of 60 million doses, which is far too little.</p><h3>But When?</h3><p>Additional supplies are to come from four other producers with whom the EU has contracts. But it remains highly uncertain when they will be able to deliver. No matter what happens, no significant quantities are expected before the summer.</p><p>The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca had to interrupt its vaccine trial and delivered disappointing testing data. French company Sanofi has postponed possible approval for its vaccine candidate to the end of 2021. Meanwhile, the vaccine from CureVac, based in Tübingen, Germany, isn’t expected until this summer. The only company that is close to delivering another vaccine candidate is Johnson &amp; Johnson in the U.S., and it isn’t expected until March.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Of course, not all of these developments could have been foreseen. The U.S., for example, believed that Sanofi would be quicker in delivering its vaccine. Still, the procurement of vaccines in Europe has been a bumpy road from the start.</p><p>Germany initiated a small vaccine alliance in the spring together with France, Italy and the Netherlands. In a first step, they reached an agreement with AstraZeneca for 400 million doses. The move was primarily intended as a means of exerting pressure because there wasn’t enough happening in Brussels. "Many countries around the world have already secured vaccines, but Europe hasn’t yet,” Health Minister Spahn warned at the time.</p><p>In mid-June, the European Commission subsequently presented an EU vaccine strategy to "ensure fair and equitable access for all across the EU.” Sufficient supplies for the member states were to be ensured by providing purchasing guarantees to manufacturers.</p><p>Health care is actually one of the competencies that is reserved for the member states in the EU. But the vaccine supply was meant to serve as a symbol of solidarity in contrast to the U.S., where Donald Trump was propagating his "America First” stance and fueling merciless global competition for the coveted vaccines.</p><p>Between August and October, the EU concluded the first of its contracts: with the pharmaceutical giants Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. Even at the time, though, it was conspicuous that the companies with the most promising vaccine candidates were not given firm contracts. BioNTech and Moderna had already obtained promising results from their studies in July and were entering the home stretch.</p><h3>No Comment</h3><p>Behind the scenes, this was the source of anger and irritation within government circles in Berlin. The irritation grew significantly in November, when the companies published data that their vaccine candidates are each up to 95 percent effective.</p><p>The manufacturers have repeatedly made it clear that they intend to distribute the vaccine according to two criteria: population size and when the contract was signed.</p><p>Way back in July, the U.S. secured 600 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine and 500 million doses from Moderna. Japan, Canada, Hong Kong and others signed contracts in the summer and autumn. The EU only reserved doses. It didn’t place concrete orders until mid-November. And even then, it ordered far less than it could have.</p>

<p>The EU only secured 200 million doses from BioNTech, with an option for 100 million more that would be manufactured later. According to sources with knowledge of the negotiations, BioNTech had additional capacity and apparently offered that capacity to the EU: up to 500 million doses in the first round.</p><p>But the European Commission reportedly rejected the offer. European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides would not comment on the exact reason. "We do not comment on the progress of negotiations," a commission spokesman said.</p><p>Why were only 300 million doses of a vaccine secured that had already demonstrated 95 percent efficacy in clinical trials at the time? One that had been hailed as a sensation and was already on its way to regulatory approval? German Health Minister Spahn pushed for more to be purchased, but he failed to prevail in the end due to opposition from several EU member countries -- in part, apparently, because the EU had ordered only 300 million doses from the French company Sanofi. "That’s why buying more from a German company wasn't in the cards,” says one insider familiar with the negotiations. The European Commission has denied that version of events,&nbsp;saying it isn’t true that Paris took massive steps to protect Sanofi.</p>

After all, Jupiter and Saturn influenced Earth’s growth and evolution. Evidence suggests there were at least three occasions on which they (Jupiter especially) chose Earth’s evolutionary path, some 4.5 billion years ago, helping to shape the planet we know and love today.</p><p>The wee infant Earth was just sitting there growing<span><br></span>Some rocky things flying by, crashing and glowing.<span><br></span>But far from the Sun, way out in the cold<span><br></span>The giants were stirring. A force to behold!<sup>3</sup></p><p>Planets grow within swirling disks of gas and dust around young stars. We have images of these disks taken with our biggest telescopes, especially the giant radio telescope ALMA. Here is one of ALMA’s classics:</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18046_4fea1a6421a72296a12cd7898b93858e.jpg" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>ALMA image of the planet-forming disk around the nearby star TW Hydrae. The disk as a whole is similar in size to the solar system, and the inner hole in the inset is about the size of Earth’s orbit.</i></span><span>S. Andrews (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA), ALMA (ESO / NAOJ / NRAO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Jupiter starved the growing Earth. This may sound like a bad thing, but without Jupiter, Earth would probably have become a colossal “super-Earth” and moved inward, onto a roasting-hot orbit close to the Sun. Not great for life.</p><p>Planets grow out of dust. It drifts around in a disk, then piles up to form 100 kilometer-scale “planetesimals,” the real building blocks of the planets. Think of these like the potato-shaped asteroids from <i><a href="http://nautil.us/blog/the-emodiversity-of-star-wars" target="_blank">Star Wars</a></i>—just bigger, farther apart, and without the giant space slugs. The rings in the ALMA image are pile-ups of sand-sized dust, where these objects may be forming right now.</p><p>Planetesimals grow further by bashing into each other, and also by sweeping up dust drifting inward. When a growing planetesimal gets massive enough, it blocks the drifting dust, not only starving itself but also blocking the dust from getting to any planetesimal closer to the Sun. These planetesimals can keep growing by self-collisions but not by any new dust originating in the outer solar system.</p><p>Jupiter’s growing core—a super-big planetesimal about ten times the mass of Earth—may have done exactly that. It grew big enough, fast enough, to stop the flow of dust. Scientists don’t know exactly why Jupiter’s core formed so much faster than Earth’s, but the reason likely has something to do with the fact that Jupiter started forming further from the Sun, where (sticky) ices could exist and contribute to its growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Meteorites corroborate this idea. The thousands of meteorites in NASA <a href="https://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/astromaterials3d/" target="_blank">collections</a> can be divided into two main classes, based on their isotopes—the relative amounts of the same elements with different numbers of neutrons. These meteorites are made out of dust that’s just the right size to drift really fast within the disk. Yet the two types of meteorites didn’t mix. Why not? Jupiter’s dust-blocking core.</p><p>Our system was neatly just sliced right in two<span><br></span>As Jupiter’s core stopped the dust flowing through.<span><br></span>If not for this, Earth would have just kept on growing <span><br></span>And wound up so close to the Sun we’d be glowing!</p><p>Jupiter and Saturn also stunted Mars’ growth. The Red Planet gets a lot of press, but it’s a runt. Mars is nine times less massive than its closest neighbor, Earth. Decades of computer simulations (starting in the late 1970s) have shown that, without an outside perturbation, Mars would have grown to be about as big as Earth—even with Jupiter blocking the flow of dust into the inner solar system.</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18039_62b4521aec8fe13ad75560a2b41b2f95.jpg" width="733" alt=""></figure><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18040_152c97a9bb6f2ababc2c73a46cfef7a3.jpg" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>The actual inner solar system (top), and what the inner solar system would look like today if not for a strong outside perturbation during the planets’ growth (bottom; according to computer simulations).</i></span><span>planetplanet.net</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why isn’t Mars bigger? There are a few different ideas out there. One scenario—called the <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2013/08/02/the-grand-tack/" target="_blank">Grand Tack</a>—has Jupiter’s orbit shifting, or “migrating,” as it grew. On its own, Jupiter would have migrated inward and probably ended up somewhere close to Earth’s orbit, which is where most of the Jupiter-mass planets around other stars are found.</p><p>This is where Saturn comes in. Jupiter and Saturn together migrate outward instead of inward. This is a neat hydrodynamical effect that takes place when two gas giants are close to each other in the same disk, and the inner one is more massive than the outer one. The flow of gas changes and creates a pileup interior to the inner planet’s orbit, which acts to push both planets outward. Like two good friends, they have the wherewithal to go against the flow and migrate outward together, whereas each would migrate inward on its own.</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18041_a4396f61160d9bfa1ea9114dacd37247.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>A hydrodynamical simulation of Jupiter and Saturn (circled) migrating in the sun’s disk.</i></span><span>Arnaud Pierens</span></figcaption></figure><p>Jupiter and Saturn’s migration emptied out Mars’ feeding zone, stunting its growth. As long as their migration turned around (“tacked” in sailing jargon) early enough, the gas giants would not have disrupted Earth’s growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Like dinosaurs, Saturn and Jupiter roamed<span><br></span>They sculpted this system that humans call home<span><br></span>Their orbits first shrank, then shifted and grew.<span><br></span>Our Earth was constructed from rocks they plowed through.</p><p>We may be observing something similar in another system almost 400 light-years away. The disk around the star PDS70 appears to be shaped by two giant baby planets, locked in an orbital resonance, and migrating around right now!&nbsp;</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18042_7e132d103ce54fda527e88a13a3d1540.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>Artist’s impression of the exoplanets PDS70 b and c as they are migrating around within their birth disk.</i></span><span>J. Olmsted (StSci)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The gas giants eventually became unstable, pelting all of the other, more inner planets with stray rocks and ice. There are several pieces of circumstantial evidence leading scientists to suspect that our solar system suffered a dynamical instability, an event during which the giant planets’ orbits changed in sudden, dramatic fashion. For instance, the giant planets’ orbits are not circles, but modestly stretched out ellipses. The Kuiper belt is almost empty, yet Pluto and Eris, another dwarf planet (discovered in 2005), needed a lot more mass to grow as big as they are. The giant planets are surrounded by clouds of “irregular satellites” that seem to have been captured from somewhere else. The orbits of Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids are strangely tilted. The list goes on.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model" target="_blank">Nice model</a>, a scenario of how our solar system dynamically evolved, developed in the French city of the same name, proposes that the giant planets’ orbits went unstable hundreds of millions of years after the planets formed (more on that later). The instability may looked something like this:&nbsp;</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18043_877d85181eb41f6b8db45bd2d29a97b4.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>Snapshots of the giant planet’s instability (from a computer simulation). The colored lines represent the orbits of the giant planets, and the white dots are leftover planetesimals.</i></span><span>Gomes et al. 2005 / Wikicommons</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the instability, the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, were kicked all over the place. The outer disk of planetesimals—basically, a huge pile of leftover comets—was almost completely cleared out. Those leftovers rained down on the planets and a few were captured (like the irregular satellites).</p><p>And later on there was a big instability<span><br></span>This time the giants expressed their hostility<span><br></span>The ice giants’ orbits were strongly affected<span><br></span>An extra one may have been fully ejected!<span><br></span>(The Earth was bombarded; no planet protected.)</p><p>There is a new twist in this story related to the timing of these events. As you know, the Moon is covered in craters. Since the 1970s, the ages of craters were thought to show a big spike in the rate of impacts hundreds of millions of years after the planets formed (remember, that was still billions of years ago). This was called the “late heavy bombardment.”&nbsp;</p><p>New analysis shows that this spike is probably just the tail end of an early bombardment, the one that grew the planets in the first place. Not a “late” heavy bombardment. This doesn’t call the past instability into question, because it can explain so many features of the solar system at the same time. But it must have happened much earlier, maybe during the growth of the rocky planets. There’s a cherry on top: New simulations show that an early giant-planet instability can even <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2018/05/29/mars-growth-stunted/" target="_blank">explain</a> why Mars is smaller than Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>In modeling events billions of years ago, we are really only constrained by two things: the laws of physics (and available evidence) and our imaginations.</p><p>We don’t have a time machine, can’t see the past<span><br></span>But models can answer some questions we’ve asked<span><br></span>To test our ideas, we use simulations<span><br></span>On giant computers, with huge calculations.</p><p>Some people like to call Jupiter and Saturn the “architects” of the solar system, as though they had a clear plan for how our system should turn out. Not us. We think of the gas giants as bullies that pushed Earth around and made a lot of decisions for us.</p><p>Some even call Jupiter Earth’s “protector.” This is because, over the past 4 billion years, its massive gravity has scattered comets and asteroids away that might otherwise have hit our planet. But on closer inspection, this doesn’t hold up. Jupiter only protects Earth from comets that Jupiter put on Earth-crossing orbits in the first place. It’s like a bully—albeit, quite a beautiful one—asking for a handout to protect you from his fist.</p><p><i>Sean Raymond is an American astrophysicist working at the Bordeaux Astrophysical Laboratory in France.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><em>By <a href="https://twitter.com/javisantana">Javi Santana</a></em></p> <p>One month before Black Friday, one of our clients in the retail space asked us to host for them the real time analytics API that feeds the dashboards that everyone in the company uses to see what’s going on (and of course, make decisions based on it).</p> <p>We knew it was tight but we specialize in running real-time stuff at scale: for example, while at Carto we served the Wall Street Journal frontpage map on 2012 during the election night, we hosted a website with a link from google.com’s home page (and a bunch of other countries) for 24 hours and some other high load events.</p> <p>In an ideal world you would setup a Kafka cluster, a streaming system to materialize some metrics on some fast key value store like redis and serve them using a lightweight backend through an API. With that you would get likely thousands of requests per second without much hardware.</p> <p>And while we can easily ingest Kafka streams, not every company works with streams, not all analytics can be precalculated easily and not all dashboards are simple counters.</p> <p>In this case we had to deal with data from a transactional database. And the analytics needed to be flexible due to filtering requirements as well as different configurations that needed to be changed on the fly and reflected instantly on the dashboard.</p> <h2 id="the-data-input">The data input</h2> <p>In order to “stream” data from the transactional database to our system, the client set up 5 parallel threads sending once per second all the rows that changed during the last second. Sounds easy but it gets complicated - wait for it.</p> <p>That means that even when just a column changes in an already existing row, the row needs to be sent again. And in a system like this, rows change quite a lot. Of course there are better ways to do this but for the use case it was good enough and allowed them to have high quality data (one of the requirements of the project)</p> <h2 id="the-infrastructure">The infrastructure</h2> <p>We used our product for the setup. It looks like:</p> <ul> <li>An Nginx load balancer</li> <li>A Varnish behind Nginx</li> <li>Our Tinybird backend. It runs the API endpoints, the load balancing for Clickhouse replicas and also the ingestion part. It’s a Python application with small bits of C++ for critical request paths.</li> <li>A Clickhouse cluster</li> <li>A Zookeeper cluster for data replication within Clickhouse</li> </ul> <p>It’s pretty simple (because we like to keep things as simple as possible) and using components we know pretty well. To be clear, in this case the amount of QPS was not going to be crazy high (less than 200QPS) so Nginx and Varnish acted just as routing tools with not so much load (more on this later) but any other load balancer would work pretty well too.</p> <h2 id="the-initial-numbers">The initial numbers</h2> <p>The plan was to have between 50-100QPS (with 120 QPS peaks) with a response time under 150ms over datasets with some millions of rows (trying not to be too specific here on purpose). The queries were not simple: they needed several joins with tables which were changing quite often so we couldn’t precalculate too many things.</p> <p>Around 5 ingestions happened per second with millions of rows ingested per minute.</p> <p>Every hour, many millions of rows would be imported to resync last hours’ with changes that might had been missed in the original database.</p> <h2 id="the-approach">The approach</h2> <p>The best way to run any analytics service is to serve static data. That’s the perfect world because it is inexpensive and fast as hell.</p> <p>With dynamic data, what you want to do is to convert the data as it’s ingested into static data so that you only process the data once. That’s possible when the amount of combinations you have to generate is low. A static blog generator with a few posts a day is one example of this.</p> <blockquote> <p>But when the amount of combinations is high you have to process the data as it comes in as much as you can so it’s fast to query, but taking into account the processing time should be low because you don’t want to add lag (if not, it would not be real-time)</p> </blockquote> <p>Our product uses Clickhouse and that’s what we used for the data storage and queries. It’s almost perfect for this use case: it allows to run queries over large amounts of data pretty fast, the latency is low and scales horizontally and vertically.</p> <p>So the plan was easy: using materialized views from Clickhouse, generating views to cover the most frequent use cases. Take into account that Clickhouse matviews are incremental - you don’t need to recalculate the whole view when new data is added. If you use Clickhouse and you are not using them you should take a look, you may save several orders or magnitude in query time.</p> <h2 id="ingestion">Ingestion</h2> <p>But there is one big problem: as I said we need to run upserts because the data comes from a transactional database. And Clickhouse (like other databases in the same space) doesn’t deal with upserts in real time.</p> <p>So what we did was to <em>split the main table</em>, the one with all the sales, in two: one (we call it RT) for the latest 30 minutes and another one for the rest (HISTORIC). Each table has the same materialized views but obviously they are different.</p> <p>The RT one is really easy to work with because the amount of rows in there is not going to be crazy, so we can recalculate it completely to run the upserts in real time. It takes less than 1 second with several million rows to run all the upserts and recalculate all the mat views for that “small” table.</p> <p>The HISTORIC one works as an incremental table and data older than 30 minutes is appended to the table. We don’t expect too many changes in rows after 30 minutes, that’s why we move data to this table.</p> <p>For rows that change after 30 minutes we run an hourly process to update parts of the HISTORIC table and recalculate all the materialized views for that table, only for data that has changed.</p> <p>The important part: we run this in several machines but taking into account we can never return inconsistent results, every operation needs to be aware of replication lag (pretty low I have to say) and run all the changes in an atomic way. This sounds easy but it isn’t; however, it is something that comes out of the box with Tinybird so we didn’t have to pay too much attention to it.</p> <p>For the table schema we tried to use the smallest possible data types to save as much space as possible since everything should be in memory to be fast. Also we used LZ4 compression (default for Clickhouse) since it provides a good ratio between compression and decoding speed, so it saves quite a lot of memory bandwidth.</p> <p>In order to optimize the ingestion process we also used one of the recently added features in Clickhouse, the in memory data parts, that lets you insert rows into a MergeTree table without actually syncing them to disk, which improves performance. All the tables were replicated (multi-master) so in case of a problem with the machine running the ingestion processes, we could switch to a different one without downtime. Data loss was really unlikely since the ingestion process would send the rows again in case of a failed insert.</p> <h2 id="querying">Querying</h2> <p>Once you have the materialized views, the queries are easy: just regular SQL following the real time rules:</p> <ul> <li>The best data is the one you don’t have to read. Using Clickhouse indexing to skip non needed data is key</li> <li>Lightweight operations first: filtering always goes first.</li> <li>Replacing joins with “WHERE column IN (SELECT …)” when possible, generally much faster. Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/javisantana/07c689564874cea6e4a31bd40fc770b1">transform function</a> when possible.</li> <li>Monitoring and optimizing query times, but also minimising the amount of bytes scanned. We always aim to scan as few bytes as possible in the first steps of the query and then try optimize to reduce the times. We split queries in several chunks so we know how many resources each part of the query takes, see <a href="https://ui.tinybird.co/snapshot/7437e5efa1f944a0b7cc017751696ea3">an example</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Also to be able to run queries over two tables without overlapping data, we used a simple but powerful technique: using a table to store the split date.</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre><span>WITH</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>select</span> <span>split_date</span> <span>from</span> <span>split_table</span>
<span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>split_date</span>
<span>select</span> <span>…</span> <span>from</span> <span>historic</span> <span>where</span> <span>date</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>split_date</span>
<span>union</span> <span>all</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>select</span> <span>split_date</span> <span>from</span> <span>split_table</span>
<span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>split_date</span>
<span>select</span> <span>…</span> <span>from</span> <span>RT</span> <span>where</span> <span>date</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>split_date</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>We have to run the Common Table Expression twice because its scope only covers one select, something that is being improved in Clickhouse as I write this.</p> <p>The objective was to run all the queries under 150ms with just one core. This is important because there was a lot of concurrency and also we have to leave some spare cores to work on the ingestion process. In our standard setup the load balancer routes more read requests to the machines not ingesting data at that moment so query time percentiles stay low.</p> <p>For the read load balancer we used a round-robin policy (all the requests take more or less the same time) but ideally the load balancer should try to route requests that use the same part of the data to the same machines to use caching as much as possible. In this case it wasn’t critical because the tables we were querying were not huge and we were running in large machines (32 cores, 64gb ram), so read tables fit in memory.</p> <p>We also used Varnish to avoid duplicate requests. When running dashboards, it’s pretty common for many browsers to request the same url at the same time, so using <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/vcl-grace.html#grace-mode">Varnish grace mode</a> we avoided extra work in the database.</p> <p>Varnish was also ready for plan B: in case of an unexpected load peak well outside of our predictions, we could enable caching with a small TTL to save some requests to the database.</p> <blockquote> <p>One final comment: we optimized queries and materialized views taking into account the distribution of calls to different endpoints. It’s much better to speed up an endpoint which is run 80% of the times than another one which is 2x slower.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this sounds like obvious but developers sometimes forget about two things: basic maths and the big picture. If you are interested we published a blog post on <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/12/15/eating-our-own-dog-food-how-we-investigate-performance-bottlenecks-using-our-product-and-google-sheets/">how we optimize our endpoints based on basic statistics</a></p> <h2 id="final-numbers-and-results">Final numbers and results</h2> <p>Numbers after Black Friday days (4 in our case):</p> <ul> <li>We ingested +650B rows.</li> <li>All the queries read a total of …</li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

			<p>There is a growing body of evidence showing that many of our current chronic diseases (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity) all revolve around the balance of utilizing fatty acids for energy, normalizing blood glucose levels, and maintaining a healthy muscle mass and weight. The SCD1 gene impacts all of these topics.</p>
<p>This article explains the function of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and then dives into the genetic variants that impact your base levels. We will end with the research on how diet impacts SCD1 and how you may be able to manipulate it for weight loss.</p>

<h2><span id="StearoylCoA_Desaturase_1_%E2%80%93_converting_fatty_acids_in_your_cells"></span>Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 – converting fatty acids in your cells<span></span></h2>
<p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1 gene) is the rate-limiting enzyme needed for the body’s creation of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>First, some background information for context (skip ahead if you know this), and then I’ll get into the SCD1 gene and how it affects overall health, weight, and metabolic health.</p>
<h3><span id="Background_how_your_body_uses_food_as_fuel"></span>Background: how your body uses food as fuel<span></span></h3>
<p>Your cells create energy from <strong>two fuel sources: carbohydrates</strong>, which break down into glucose, <strong>and fat</strong>, which can be utilized in fatty acid oxidation for energy. When glucose is available, it is used preferentially for creating energy, and when glucose levels fall, fatty acids get used for energy.</p>
<p>We survive as a species because we are flexible in our ability to survive eating different diets — from hunter-gatherers eating mammoths and tubers to agrarian cultures eating mainly grains to my Irish ancestors who likely made it through famine times eating potatoes.</p>

<p>The body can convert glucose into fat for storage(called <em>de novo lipogenesis</em>), and it can convert fat back into glucose if needed (<em>gluconeogenesis</em>). While most cells can run on fatty acids for fuel, the brain needs glucose and thus the conversion of fat to glucose if needed.</p>
<p>When you eat foods containing fat, the fat gets broken down in a couple of ways with different lipase enzymes. These lipase enzymes (gastric, pancreatic) break up the fat into fatty acids and glycerol, and then bile acids act as emulsifiers, allowing the fatty acid to cross the mucous layer for absorption. (more thorough <a href="https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Nutrition/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Nutrition_(Zimmerman)/05%3A_Lipids/5.04%3A_Digestion_and_Absorption_of_Lipids#:~:text=In%20the%20stomach%20fat%20is,fats%20through%20the%20lymph%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explanation here</a>)</p>
<h4><span id="Background_Fatty_acids_in_the_body"></span>Background: Fatty acids in the body<span></span></h4>
<p>While we often just think of ‘fat’ as the extra padding around our waist and hips, fatty acids have <strong>three different roles</strong> in the body:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fatty acids, mainly unsaturated fatty acids, make up the<strong> cell membranes</strong> of all the cells in the body.</li>
<li>Fatty acids can break down for the mitochondria use them to create <strong>energy</strong> in the form of ATP. Fatty acids are also the main way of storing fuel for later use.</li>
<li>Fatty acids can act as <strong>signaling molecules</strong>, causing many different downstream effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>So keep in mind that as we dig into this topic of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the body is regulating and using these fats in multiple ways.</p>
<h4><span id="Background_Types_of_fatty_acids"></span>Background: Types of fatty acids<span></span></h4>
<p>Fatty acids consist of carbon and hydrogen and referred to as saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fats have all of their carbons bound to hydrogens, and unsaturated fats have at least one carbon bound to another carbon instead of a hydrogen. This change in the structure of the fatty acid differentiates saturated from unsaturated fats.</p>
<p>Saturated fats are generally solids at room temperature, and unsaturated fats are liquids.</p>
<p>Fatty acids are named based on the number of carbons in the chain and how many unsaturated double bonds between carbons exist. Saturated fats have no unsaturated double bonds. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have one unsaturated double bond, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have two unsaturated double bonds.</p>

<h3><span id="SCD1_converting_saturated_fat_to_monounsaturated_fat"></span>SCD1: converting saturated fat to monounsaturated fat<span></span></h3>
<p>Getting back on topic here, the stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme is found in all cell types and in all animals and plants. The SCD1 gene codes for the stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme which converts saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>The cell membrane surrounding all of your cells consists of fatty acids. Some of those fatty acids can be saturated, but most of them need to be unsaturated, in order to give more fluidity to the cell membrane. Saturated fats, which are solids at room temperature, are less fluid in cell walls.</p>
<p>The stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme changes the bond in the saturated fat to make it unsaturated and more flexible.</p>
<p>Specifically, the SCD enzyme converts stearic acid (saturated fat with 18 carbons) into oleic acid (unsaturated fat, 18 carbons, and one unsaturated double bond).&nbsp; It can also convert palmitic acid into palmitoleic acid.</p>

<p>Saturated and unsaturated fats are also found in foods that you eat. Stearic acid is found in beef fat (tallow), chocolate (cacao butter), and dairy fat. Palmitic acid is found in palm oil.</p>
<p>I’ll come back to the dietary aspects of SCD1 in the Lifehacks section…</p>
<p><strong>Does SCD1 alter your ability to burn off stored fat?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To lose weight, you have to use your stored fat for energy at a rate that is higher than your rate of replacing that fat.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered that <strong>SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is increased in people with obesity and metabolic syndrome.</strong> Additionally, people who are obese have higher ratios of monounsaturated fat to saturated fat (MUFA:SFA ratio).[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>][<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30754064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>The question, though, is whether the increased SCD1 caused obesity or whether it was elevated in response to having metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>Animal research may give us the answer. Research consistently shows that lower SCD1 levels keep the animal lean, even on a diet that normally would make them fat. The researchers decrease the SCD1 levels through manipulating the gene in various tissues of the animal, seeing the results of knocking out the gene in different organs.</p>
<p><em>Why does a lower SCD1 level keep mice lean?</em> The lack of SCD1 enzyme causes an increase in the rate of using up fat for fuel in the mitochondria. This increased fatty acid β-oxidation is through activation of the AMPK pathway.[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>decreased SCD1 = increased burning of fat</p>
<p>Additionally, mice with <strong>SCD1 deficiency had better insulin sensitivity and reduced liver fat</strong>. They were ‘hypermetabolic’, burning off fat at a faster rate, irrespective of a fattening diet. The researchers were able to pinpoint that the <strong>deletion of SCD1 in skin and muscle tissue</strong> is what keeps the mice lean through increasing overall metabolism.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>][<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>While <strong>decreased SCD1</strong> gives the benefit of decreasing weight gain, it also <strong>increases oxidative stress in the mitochondria and stress in the endoplasmic reticulum</strong>. Specifically, it seems that the decrease in oleic acid drives the ER stress, while low palmitoleic acid does not seem to matter.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>

<p><em>Let’s dig into some more details here…</em></p>
<h4><span id="Liberating_fat_from_your_adipose_tissue"></span>Liberating fat from your adipose tissue:<span></span></h4>
<p>Lipolysis is the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue for use in the body as energy or in other ways.</p>
<p>Most cells in the body get replaced at the end of their lifecycle. This happens quickly for some cell types, like intestinal cells that turn over in a matter of days, and more slowly for other types, like heart cells which turnover very slowly, if at all.</p>
<p>Adipose cells are around for about 9 years, on average. Interestingly, the fat stored in adipose tissue has an average age of 1.4 years. This means that once the fat is stored, it doesn’t get used up and replaced very fast. As people who are obese get older, the usage of fat from fat cells for fuel tends to slow down and accumulation speeds up a bit.[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21947005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>The SCD1 enzyme is key in the fatty acid composition in your adipose tissue. Animal studies show that knocking out the SCD1 gene alters the fatty acid make up of adipocytes.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5625094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<h4><span id="Brown_fat,_beige_fat,_and_white_fat"></span>Brown fat, beige fat, and white fat:<span></span></h4>
<p>Brown fat, found in small amounts in adults, is an active type of fat cell that burns through a lot of fuel and produces a lot of heat. Lean people usually have more brown adipose tissue, and people who are obese usually have little to no brown fat. Brown fat is brown due to the high number of mitochondria in each cell, and it helps to both produce heat and burn off excess energy.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>White fat (white adipose tissue) is what you typically think of for fat cells. It is a storage cell, keeping fat on board for a time of famine. Not as many mitochondria, not producing the heat or energy that the brown fat does.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers discovered that white adipose tissue can be induced to become more like brown adipose tissue. This in-between fat cell type is termed beige or brite adipose tissue. Exposure to cold is one way that white adipose tissue can be induced to become the heat-producing, metabolically active beige fat.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>A 2020 research paper published in <em>PNAS</em> shows that when adipose cells are formed from stem cells, they can take two paths: white or beige. SCD1 is key to which path the stems cells take. The animal study showed that decreased SCD1 caused the stem cells to differentiate into beige adipose tissue, rather than white. The decreased SCD1 only affected the formation of new adipose cells – it didn’t convert existing white adipose tissue to beige.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>Succinate is an intermediary formed when the mitochondria produce ATP in the electron transport chain. The researchers also found that the rising succinate levels due to the lack of SCD1 were the trigger for beige adipose differentiation. In cell culture, succinate alone is capable of causing adipose stem cells to differentiate as beige cells instead of white. The increase in succinate accompanies an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In this short tutorial, you will learn to search, browse, and retrieve wiki data from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>For this, we will be using a python library called <span>Wikipedia-API</span> which is quite impressive. Wikipedia-API is an easy to use Python wrapper for <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia’s</a> API. It supports extracting texts, sections, links, categories, translations, etc from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>It even allows you to retrieve the wiki information as HTML so that you could use it in web apps or websites.</p>



<p>We will begin by installing the library:</p>

<pre><code>pip install wikipedia-api</code></pre>



<h2>Searching Wikipedia</h2>

<p>Let's search for the term "Computer Programming"</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki.page("Computer Programming")</code></pre>

<p>The <span>first line of code imports the<tt> wikipediaapi</tt></span> and the<span> second line creates a Wikipedia object</span>. The last line searches for the page on<em> "Computer Programming"</em> and returns a <span>WikipediaPage object </span>which is then stored in the <code>page</code> variable.</p>

<p>To check if the page exists:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.exists())          # True</code></pre>

<p><br>
To retrieve a page summary:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.summary)</code></pre>

<p><br>
For the full URL of the page:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.fullurl)           # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming</code></pre>



<h2>Extracting all information from the Wikipedia page.</h2>

<p>Ok, now let's do more like extracting the whole page in a text format. Putting it all together,</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki.page("Computer Programming")

print("---------- title ----------")
print(page.title)

print("----------- Page URL ---------")
print(page.fullurl)

print("---------- summary ----------")
print(page.summary[:100])             # slicing summary
print()

print("---------- Main text information -----------")
print(page.text)</code></pre>

<p><br>
<strong><span>output:</span></strong></p>

<pre><code>---------- title ----------
Computer Programming
----------- Page URL ---------
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming
---------- summary ----------
Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to acco

---------- Main text information -----------
Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable 
computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms
 accuracy and resource consumption...(it's more)</code></pre>



<p>Note that the <strong>main text information </strong>is a lot of information and I've truncated it here for simplicity.</p>



<h2>Extracting page in HTML</h2>

<p>To extract a wiki page in HTML, we must tweak our wiki object a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki_html = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia(language="en",
                                   extract_format=wikipediaapi.ExtractFormat.HTML)

page_html = wiki_html.page("Computer Programming")

print("---------- HTML ----------")
print(page_html.text)</code></pre>

<p><br>
<span><strong>output (truncated):</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>---------- HTML ----------
&lt;p class="mw-empty-elt"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computer programming&lt;/b&gt; is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. 
Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen 
programming language (commonly referred to as &lt;b&gt;coding&lt;/b&gt;). The source code of a program is
 written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. 
The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) 
on a computer, often for solving a given problem. 
Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the...(truncated)</code></pre>



<h2>How to get all Wikipedia pages under a category</h2>

<p>Wikipedia puts its pages under categories like Physics, Science, Programming, Medicine, Company, Celebrity, Countries, Books, etc.</p>

<p>To retrieve all pages in a particular category:</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki_html = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki_html.page("Category:Physics")

for c in page.categorymembers.values():
    print(c)</code></pre>

<p><strong>output</strong></p>

<pre><code>Physics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Outline of physics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Portal:Physics (id: ??, ns: 100)
Apriorics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Computational anatomy (id: ??, ns: 0)
Conformon (id: ??, ns: 0)
Diffeomorphometry (id: ??, ns: 0)
Dispersive medium (id: ??, ns: 0)
Galilean non-invariance of classical electromagnetism (id: ??, ns: 0)
Homeokinetics (id: ??, ns: 0)
...
...
...</code></pre>



<p>Well, that is it for this tutorial, this is useful when you want to use some data from Wikipedia inside your web applications or any programs you may write.</p>

It contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) which has instructions for making the spike protein. This is a protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which the virus needs to enter the body’s cells.</p><p>When a person is given the vaccine, some of their cells will read the mRNA instructions and temporarily produce the spike protein. The person’s immune system will then recognise this protein as foreign and produce antibodies and activate T cells (white blood cells) to attack it.</p><p>If, later on, the person comes into contact with SARS-CoV-2 virus, their immune system will recognise it and be ready to&nbsp;defend the body against it.</p><p>The mRNA from the vaccine does not stay in the body but is broken down shortly after vaccination.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/conditional-marketing-authorisation" id="glossary-term-43109" target="_blank" title="The approval of a medicine that addresses unmet medical needs of patients on the basis of less comprehensive data than normally required.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>This web page is also available in <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/index.html.ja" lang="ja">日本語</a>.

</p>

<p id="summary">Yash, yet another shell,
is a POSIX-compliant command line shell written in C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999).
Yash is intended to be the most POSIX-compliant shell in the world
while supporting features for daily interactive and scripting use.
Notable features are:
</p><ul>
<li>Global aliases
</li><li>Arrays
</li><li>Socket redirection, pipeline redirection, and process redirection
</li><li>Brace expansion and extended globbing
</li><li>Fractional numbers in arithmetic expansion
</li><li>Prompt command and command-not-found handler
</li><li>Command line completion with predefined completion scripts for more than 100 commands
</li><li>Command line prediction based on command history
</li></ul>
<p>Yash can be modified/redistributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(Version 2) but the use of this program is
<strong>without any warranty</strong>.
</p><p><a href="https://osdn.net/"></a>:
Yash is an OSDN-hosted project. See also the
<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/">project summary page</a>.

</p><h2 id="progress">Current Development Status</h2>
<p>Yash now fully supports POSIX.1-2008 (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2016 Edition)
except for the limitations listed in <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/README">README</a>.
</p><p>Yash is stable. A maintenance update is released every three months or so.
For the change history, see <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/NEWS">NEWS</a>.
</p><p>The source code is versioned in the <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/scm/svn/">Subversion repository</a> and mirrored
on <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash">GitHub</a>.

</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Yash is supposed to build and run on any POSIX.1-2001 environment
with the Software Development Utilities and the C-Language Development Utilities
options.
Currently, yash is mainly tested on Fedora, macOS, and Cygwin.

</p><h2 id="downloads">Installation</h2>
<p>The source tarball can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/releases/">release page</a>
(or the <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/releases">release list</a>).
</p><p>On <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>, the yash package can be installed by <kbd>sudo dnf install yash</kbd>. On <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, the yash package can be installed by <kbd>sudo apt-get install yash</kbd>. For macOS, <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> and <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> provide yash installation.
</p><p>After installation, enter <kbd>yash</kbd> in the terminal to start yash.
The <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/doc/">manual</a> can be viewed by <kbd>man yash</kbd>.

</p><h2 id="configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>

<h3>Initialization scripts</h3>
<p>When yash is started as a login shell, it reads ~/.yash_profile.
This file is a shell script in which you define environment variables using the export command.
</p><p>When yash is started for an interactive use, it reads ~/.yashrc (after reading ~/.yash_profile if it is a login shell also).
In this file, you make other configurations such as aliases, prompt strings, key bindings for command line editing, and command-not-found handler.
Use the <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/share/initialization/sample">sample yashrc</a> as a template for your ~/.yashrc.

</p><h3>Making yash your login shell</h3>
<p>In many Unix-like OSes, a shell must be listed in /etc/shells to be set as a login shell. Edit this file and ensure that the path to yash is written in the file.
</p><p>Then, run the <kbd>chsh</kbd> command in the terminal and follow instructions from the command.
Depending on your system, you may have to use another command to change the login shell.
See documentation on your system.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Commentary: Red Hat has been in hot water about changing the way CentOS operates, but that model looks like the exact right way for open source entrepreneurs to operate.</p><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
<figure><span></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Red Hat switched up CentOS to make it less of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone and more of a feeder project into RHEL (as Fedora was always supposed to be, yet wasn’t). Some people are mad, as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-resets-centos-linux-and-users-are-angry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols has written</a> on sister site ZDNet. Some people, like former Disney employee Justin Garrison, <a href="https://twitter.com/rothgar/status/1337818039799070722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">think</a> it sounds perfect (the hipper, slightly edgier version of RHEL). If you’re a billion-dollar company upset that Red Hat appears to be trying to charge for something you value, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-centos-hello-rocky-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">founder of CentOS has a new way for you to get something for nothing</a>: Rocky Linux.</p>

<p>But if you’re an open source entrepreneur wondering what this means for you, well, Chef cofounder and System Initiative CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Adam Jacob has you covered</a>. In a series of tweets, he walks through how Red Hat’s CentOS strategy can play out for you. (He should know, as the company he co-founded, Chef, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-chefs-100-open-source-move-is-smart-business/" data-absolute="true">last year open sourced everything</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s observe.</p>
<h2>Open source all the things</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob’s first rule</a>? Open it up. Completely. “If I do an open source strategy for a company ever again, I will own the upstream, it will be fully open source, and I’ll happily collaborate with anyone downstream.” But not just an open upstream–it’s also important to, “Produce a commercial distribution [and c]ollaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062321982758912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">argued</a>.</p>
<p>What does he mean by “upstream” and “downstream”? In open source, think of the <a href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/993/what-does-upstream-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">upstream</a> as the parent, the head, the initial open source project. Downstream might be forks or distributions (packaging up of a particular build of the upstream code) of the upstream.</p>
<p>What Red Hat announced was basically that CentOS would move from being downstream to upstream. It becomes a place, as <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062318451068929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob noted</a>, that others <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">like Facebook</a> can collaborate with Red Hat in a way they simply couldn’t before (as Fedora wasn’t closely enough aligned with RHEL). CentOS as a downstream RHEL community was mostly one of users, of consumers, not of collaborators. It was somewhere to get RHEL, but rebranded CentOS, for free.</p>
<p>As such, Jacob pointed out, “They weren’t invested in it beyond using it.” And when someone removes the downstream they get mad “because it’s like someone threatened the water supply,” <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062319558434822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">he argued</a>. It’s therefore far better to condition people to participate as collaborators with an open source project, and through the commercial distribution to also condition users to become customers, if they want the certified distribution.</p>
<h2>Open source + cloud</h2>
<p>One way that open source companies are doing this model to fantastic effect is by open sourcing their upstream and creating a cloud distribution (read: managed service). A variety of companies have embraced this model to greater or lesser extents.</p>
<p>Yugabyte, for example, ditched its Open Core model a year ago and open sourced 100% of its database code. A year later, CTO Karthik Ranganathan told me in an interview, “It increased our adoption like crazy,” growing the number of Yugabyte clusters 10x, but it also has dramatically accelerated their business without them losing any known pipeline. Could someone take that upstream and create a competitive downstream competitor? Of course. But no one should be able to out-Yugabyte on their home turf.</p>
<p>Or take Redis Labs. The company has fiddled with licensing over the last few years, but has kept core Redis completely open while encouraging a growing community (which includes downstream competitors) to lend a hand to improving the code. While Redis Labs doesn’t publish results, its business is booming, even as 10 or so other companies have created competitive downstream managed service offerings.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Jacob: “Run an open upstream from the jump. Produce a commercial distribution. Collaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open.”</p>
<p>That’s the strategy. That’s the magic. You don’t need to go Open Core or any other permutation of kind-of, sort-of open source. You can open source everything and just ensure you have a rock-solid managed cloud service. This reliance on cloud is what’s driving MongoDB, Confluent, DataStax, Redis Labs, and others to great success. It can be your model, too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
<p>I just finished the implementation of an important feature of Pijul: clones, pushes and pulls on partial repositories. In this post, I explain why this matters.</p>
<h2 id="change-commutation">Change commutation</h2>
<p>Pijul is based on <em>changes</em>, also called <em>patches</em> or <em>diffs</em>.
This doesn’t mean that its only internal datastructure is patches, quite to the contrary: it was only by departing from a patch-only internal representation that we were able to solve the algorithmic challenges inherent to patch-based systems.</p>
<p>However, being change-based does mean that the core operations of Pijul are defined on changes, and that Pijul is designed in such a way that changes satisfy basic intuitive properties, similar to algebraic operations. One basic thing is that applying a change is an <em>associative</em> operation, like matrix multiplication: applying $A$ and $B$ at once, and then later $C$, is the same as applying $A$, and then $B$ and $C$ at once. In matrix multiplication, $(AB)C = A(BC)$. Moreover, in Pijul, all changes are invertible (whereas only some matrices are): for any change $A$, there is an “inverse change” $A^{-1}$ such that applying $A^{-1}$ after $A$ is the same as applying neither. Of course, both $A$ and $A^{-1}$ will appear in the log, but the contents of the repository will be the same as applying neither $A$ nor $A^{-1}$.</p>
<p>There is another property that users want from version control systems, and that is <strong>commutation</strong>.
Matrix multiplication rarely commutes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
In Git, commutation is usually <em>simulated</em> using branches and rebase: indeed, rebasing a branch A on top of another branch B really means commuting the commits of A since the divergence between A and B, and the commits of B since the divergence. However, that commutation isn’t perfect, since the commits must change their hash when rebased.</p>
<p>Things are simpler in Pijul, because any two changes that <em>could have been written independently</em> always commute, meaning that if the two changes could be written without knowledge of each other, they can be applied in any order.</p>
<p>This of course raises a potential concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can apply $A$ and $B$ in any order, how do I know which order is the <strong>right</strong> one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Pijul, this question <strong>does not matter</strong>: both orders will yield <strong>the exact same result</strong>, the only difference is that the log will list the changes in the order in which they were applied. And I’m not saying that it doesn’t matter because I’m careless, but because it truly is the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree: it does matter, I still prefer to have a “<em>linear</em>” order for my changes/commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, everybody wants to see the order of operations in a repository, for many reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep a record of the operations performed on our repository.</li>
<li>We want to go back in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in fact, Pijul allows you to do exactly that, but in a more rigorous way than Git. Indeed, take the scenario where Alice and Bob work together, Alice makes a change $A$ while Bob makes $B$. When they put their work together, Alice applies Bob’s change, resulting in the log $AB$, while Bob applies Alice’s change, resulting in the log $BA$. In this case, there is no “true” linear history, since they worked on different things, and took different steps at different times. However, both of them want to be able to go back in time, step-by-step, and not just “<em>step-by-step-according-to-Bob’s-order</em>”.</p>
<h2 id="commutation-and-massive-repositories">Commutation and massive repositories</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenge for Pijul up to the recent releases was scalability: even modestly-sized repositories like Pijul’s source code would use a lot of disk space. This was even more disappointing since, as I’m about to explain, commutation was suposed to allow it to scale to gigantic repository sizes… in theory. The same problem also made massive tests impossible, meaning that getting past the “0.x releases” seemed more and more impossible as time passed.</p>
<p>Now that this phase is mostly behind us, the cool bits of the theory finally become practical.</p>
<p>In particular, in Pijul, each change contains a reference to the files it modifies. Note that, because we want operations on repositories (such as renaming files) to commute with edits inside files, we don’t identify files and directories by name, but by a unique identifier made from the hash of the change that introduced that file or directory.</p>
<p>For repositories with multiple projects, this makes it possible to clone and pull just parts of a repository, and work on that part as if we had the entire thing. Indeed, imagine we have a repository with the following log:</p>
<ol>
<li>A, adding file <em>x</em></li>
<li>B, editing <em>x</em></li>
<li>C, adding file <em>y</em></li>
<li>D, adding file <em>z</em></li>
<li>E, renaming <em>x</em> to <em>w</em></li>
<li>F, editing <em>y</em> and <em>z</em></li>
</ol>
<p>All these changes do not necessarily commute; however, since B and C touch completely different files (namely, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>), they could be produced in parallel, and hence they commute. This means that we can pull only the changes related to a specific file, say <em>x</em>, and make the following history: A, B, E<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, any change made on top of that sequence will commute with C, D and F: indeed, if we edit file <em>x</em> again, producing a change G, then since G can be made in parallel to C, D and F, we can push G after any patch that comes after B in that history, for example getting history “ABCDEFG”.</p>
<p>Note that this is done without changing the changes nor their hash.</p>
<h2 id="another-trick-for-large-files">Another trick for large files</h2>
<p>As explained in previous posts on this blog, Pijul changes have a bit more information than diffs, and operate on graphs rather than files. This means that changes can be split into two parts, a short-ish one with a binary specification of the graph operations, and then the new content inserted by the change.</p>
<p>The change format is designed to be downloadable in two stages: one can download the operations without downloading the contents. One issue with this is security: if we don’t download the contents, how can we make sure that the hash is right? This is done by including a hash of the change in the “operations” section of the change, and letting the hash of a change be the hash of the “operations” section.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for someone to make five versions of a large binary file in a day, where each change deletes the entire file, and adds it again, the operation sections only contain the length of the different versions, not the actual bytes. In order to get the latest version of the file, a client will therefore only have to download the latest change completely, and only the operations section of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Note that this makes the following “attack” possible: a server might trick a client into believing that the server has a change with hash $A$, which inserts $n$ bytes into a file, and then another change with hash $B$, deleting all these bytes. When the client downloads $A$ and $B$, it doesn’t need to download the contents. However, if the client later decides to unrecord $B$, the contents of $A$ will have to be downloaded, and the client will be able to tell that the hash of $A$ was incorrect. This should make it impossible to unrecord $B$ without also unrecording $A$. However, if $A$ made other edits, and other changes depend on $A$, this could be problematic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>There is one remaining painpoint for very large repositories, and this is the fact that in order to clone a repository with a very large history, one must download and apply all the changes, one by one. Even though our apply function is quite fast<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, this can still be problematic for dozens or hundreds of thousands of changes.</p>
<p>In my next post, I will talk about a solution to this problem, which I have started to implement.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Matrices that are simultaneously diagonalizable do, for example, but for two arbitrary matrices $A$ and $B$, $AB$ is often different from $BA$. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that in this case, we could also pull A, E, B, since renaming a file commutes with editing it. However, we must start with A, since adding a file could not be possibly done in parallel to editing or renaming it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The complexity of apply is in $O(|p| |c| \log |H|)$, where $|p|$ is the size of the change, $|c|$ is the size of the largest conflict in which $p$ is involved, and $|H|$ is the number of edits made since the start of the repository. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://transposit.imgix.net/img/2019.12.23a.jpg?auto=format&amp;ch=Width,DPR&amp;q=95&amp;w=800" alt="Picture of fire burning in a fireplace"></p><p>Are you sitting by the fire sipping cocoa, worrying secretly about whether you’ll have to put out an engineering fire any minute?</p><p>If only everyone could enjoy a well-earned break from on call life, the week would be more relaxing, but there is no rest for the technology that keeps our world running. This week certain industries are reaching a holiday high, and DevOps, SREs, and on call engineers everywhere will have to don their invisible superhero capes and keep us humans and our devices connected, just like they always do.</p><p>At Transposit, we know the pain of on call ourselves, and so we’ve banded together to come up with some of our top tips for making holiday on call shifts as painless as possible.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-one%3A">On Call Tip Number One: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-one%3A">#</a></h2><p>Whether on-callers are planning on having a Rockwellian Christmas, lighting the menorah with Bubbe, visiting family abroad, or taking a tropical trip with the two federal holidays padding their vacation request, there is one consistent truth about the holiday week between Christmas and New Years: Mass exodus from the office. So, before we even get into the challenges of answering a page when no one is around to help you, how can you avoid that conundrum in the first place?</p><p>On call engineering managers should be careful to adjust on call schedules so that the same people are not on call during multiple peak times. Which times are most painful are up to the individual, so giving each person the opportunity to sign up for what works for them first is always a best practice. Perhaps someone doesn’t mind being on call Christmas morning, but absolutely can’t do it on New Years Eve. Start by letting people pick what is ideal for them, and then fill in the remaining gaps, being sure not to unduly burden any one member of the team.</p><p>When making the on call schedule, make sure that there are primaries and secondaries who are committed to each shift, since they will likely be working together without quick access to the rest of the team when something goes wrong.</p><p>To reduce the pain further, consider upping on call bonuses for the entire week as an incentive for taking on undesirable shifts, and once everyone is back in the office in January, be sure to acknowledge the on-callers who responded quickly to keep the business running while everyone else was enjoying their time away from work.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-two%3A">On Call Tip Number Two: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-two%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">Communicate early and often, with and without runbooks. <a href="#communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">#</a></h3><p>Without easy access to the rest of the team, good playbook/runbook documentation during this period is even more important than it is the rest of the year. If your typical on call process involves opening up a collaborative team Slack thread or Jira ticket and then letting various experts or senior SREs weigh in, you might face a rude awakening when your reliable experts are MIA during the holiday week.</p><p>Make sure your runbooks are updated and everyone has easy access to the DevOps systems they need before everyone leaves on vacation, because if on-callers are left to search half-empty wikis by themselves, the speed to resolution is going to be stressful for everyone - engineers, managers, and executives alike.</p><p>Additionally, make sure that primary and secondary on-callers know exactly who they are paired with for a particular shift. Make sure that both are committed to being fully available and sober during their shifts, so that in the absence of the whole team, they are secure in having at least one problem-solving partner.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-three%3A">On Call Tip Number Three: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-three%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="plan-around-potential-travel-problems">Plan around potential travel problems <a href="#plan-around-potential-travel-problems">#</a></h3><p>While it may seem obvious to plan your travel around your on call shifts so that you aren’t in the air while you’re supposed to be available, these days, we sometimes have too much faith in our connectivity during travel. Airports and even some planes have wifi, many airplane seats have built-in electricity and jacks, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Remember, this week is one of the busiest travel weeks of the year in the US, so our already strained infrastructure will be at the edge of capacity in the best of circumstances. You won’t be very effective at troubleshooting an outage if you are standing in a 2-hour long airport security line or sitting in a traffic jam on the way up to the mountains. Add unpredictable winter weather to the mix, and we have on call disasters in the making. So, what should on-callers do?</p><p>First, you should plan wider time-frames for travel around your on call shifts to avoid accidentally being unavailable. You also shouldn’t count on access to wifi on your flights (only some planes are equipped, and airlines often shift which plane is flying a certain route based on weather and mechanical issues). Don’t expect access to electricity in the airport to charge your computer or phone, as the high number of travelers may easily keep the charging stations fully occupied, and make sure you have your computer and charger easily accessible, so that if you are forced to gate-check a bag on your crowded flight, you will be sure to keep these precious items on your person.</p><p>Traveling on-callers should also remember that time zones are a thing - your on call planning will need to be adjusted accordingly. If you are the secondary, your primary may be in a different time zone (or vice versa), and you should discuss your plans with them beforehand so that you are prepared for them to be asleep at different hours.</p><p>Finally, if you are traveling anywhere that has inclement weather or otherwise unreliable access to internet, you should have a back-up plan, such as tethering your computer to your phone’s data service to get around unreliable wifi. If you arrive at your destination and realize that you have bad data service, finicky wifi, or (gasp) the possibility of power outages, you should admit your defeat early and find an understanding colleague to take your shift, rather than hoping for the best and leaving any alerts to your back-ups.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-four%3A">On Call Tip Number Four: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-four%3A">#</a></h2><p>We’ve already talked about the importance of secondaries as problem-solving partners, but what about the other, more social challenges of being on call during this time? Let’s say you’re sitting down to a nice family dinner, and, just like you were dreading, there goes your phone dinging with an urgent alert. How are you going to explain this situation to your relatives, who in many cases, don’t really understand what you do?</p><p>This is where a friendly ally can help serve as your secondary within your social situation. If you arm a sibling or supportive partner with talking points to explain why you have to get up from the festive table to crouch frantically over your laptop in the back room, you will be able to focus on troubleshooting without worrying about the familial fallout.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-five%3A">On Call Tip Number Five: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-five%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">Pat yourself and your team on the back <a href="#pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">#</a></h3><p>It should go without saying, and so often it does, that there is a reason the world functions so smoothly during this week, despite its unique circumstances. While a lot of the credit is due to excellent engineering and team planning throughout the rest of the year, there are always unanticipated incidents that simply can’t be avoided. That’s why on call shifts, DevOps, and SREs exist in the first place! And so, as we look back on the year, and the incidents resolved during this special last week of 2019, let’s remember to give a shout out to all the engineering heroes who stepped forward to make it happen. Cheers to you!</p></div></div>]]>

December 21, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  It's 2019 and Lisp stories are on fire at HackerNews. While there exist multiple Lisp dialects, Common Lisp is the
  oldest and most mentioned. Thus, if you're looking to get started with programming in Common Lisp, then there are 2
  options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://portacle.github.io/">portacle</a> to get up and running with SBCL + Emacs.</li>
  <li>
    Use
    <a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">roswell</a> to install multiple Lisp implementations + build and bundle
    lisp applications. Roswell installs SBCL by default.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As for me, I did not feel like learning a brand new text editor just to get started with Lisp so I went with Roswell.
  Follow the instructions on installing Roswell for your platform. In my case, I decided to install it under
  <code>$HOME/bin</code> on my linux machine via:
</p>

<pre>$ sudo apt install rlwrap
$ mkdir $HOME/bin
$ git clone -b release https://github.com/roswell/roswell.git
$ cd roswell/
$ sh bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin
$ make
$ make install</pre>

<p>
  Make sure to add the roswell path to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (note that roswell installed itself under
  <code>~/bin/bin</code> and if this looks odd to you, install it under <code>$HOME/apps</code> or something of the
  sort):
</p>

<pre>if [ -d "$HOME/bin/bin" ] ; then
  PATH="$HOME/bin/bin:$PATH"
fi</pre>

<p>
  Open a new terminal and setup roswell:
</p>

<pre>$ which ros
/home/xxx/bin/bin/ros
$ ros --version
roswell 19.06.10.100
$ ros setup </pre>

<p>
  We will now setup VSCode to run lisp. First install the
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattn.Lisp">vscode-lisp</a> extension. Open a new file
  and type the following in:
</p>

<pre>(defun main ()
  (format t "Hello world"))
</pre>

<p>
  Then <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal">launch a terminal</a> inside VSCode. In
  the terminal run <code>rlwrap ros run</code> to start the REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop). Select the above defined
  function and use the "Run Selected Text in Active Terminal" from the Command Palette (F1) to run your code!
  Note that you can exit the REPL via: <code>(SB-EXT:EXIT)</code>. The <code>rlwrap</code> utility remembers previously
  typed commands which makes for a much nicer REPL experience.
</p>

<p>
  What is amazing about Roswell is that is comes with a scripting / build ability that allows you to easily distribute
  your application. To see this in action first create a roswell script via <code>ros init hello-world</code>. Then add
  in the following code so that your script looks like the following:
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh
#|-*- mode:lisp -*-|#
#|
exec ros -Q -- $0 "$@"
|#
(progn ;;init forms
  (ros:ensure-asdf)
  ;;#+quicklisp(ql:quickload '() :silent t)
  )

(defpackage :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541
  (:use :cl))
(in-package :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541)

(defun helloWorld
  ()
  (format t "Hello world")
)

(defun main (&amp;rest argv)
  (declare (ignorable argv))
  (helloWorld))
;;; vim: set ft=lisp lisp:
</pre>

<p>
  We can now simply run this script via <code>ros hello-world.ros</code> but more interestingly, we can actually compile
  a binary via <code>ros build hello-world.ros &amp;&amp; ./hello-world</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly enough, I am not a complete noob to Common Lisp, I actually programmed it 15 years ago during my
  undergrad years. A colleague and I
  <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/847c726edff337b818ba86914d9e71b6">compared an experimental genetic algorithm against an ant colony optimization algoritm on a path-finding problem</a>. Once I had lisp running I opened up the project and basically executed <code>ants.lisp</code> in the REPL, ran
  <code>(INITIALIZE-ANT-WORLD)</code> followed by <code>(DISPATCH-ANTS)</code> and voila, my ants were able to find
  their food!
</p>

<p>
  No guide to getting started with Lisp would be complete without a list of further reading that will keep you busy for
  the next 100 years so here we go:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A very basic Lisp <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/learn/first-steps">tutorial</a> which also features an excellent
    <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/books/">list</a> of Lisp books
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/3c02f249908494a961ac4b28e33f1ec5">A road to common lisp</a> - Steve Losh's excellent guide to
    getting into Lisp programming. The following is a small snippet of useful information from the post:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Files are files on your hard drive.
      </li>
      <li>Packages are containers of symbols. They are orthogonal to files.</li>
      <li>
        Systems are collections of code, instructions on how to load that code, dependency lists, and metadata. They are
        orthogonal to packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projects are high-level collections of "stuff" such as code, documentation, maybe some image assets,
        etc. They are (mostly) orthogonal to systems.
      </li>
      <li>Common Lisp itself knows about files and packages.</li>
      <li>ASDF adds systems.</li>
      <li>Quicklisp adds the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    This guide also provides a very nice review of libraries and is definitey worth a read.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/cb5d30e9026cba3d1d0b838611d1624c">article</a> that recommends roswell and provides
    instructions for Atom integration along with project and library management.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Well, that's about it - Lisp is beautiful and I'm off to wrap my head around some 15 year old code that doesn't look
  too bad, go functional programming!

You may also want to consider visiting our post on <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/">how to train YOLO v5 in PyTorch tutorial</a> as it gets much better results than YOLO v3.</p><p><a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection">Object detection models</a> are extremely powerful—from finding dogs in photos to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05747.pdf">improving healthcare</a>, training computers to recognize which pixels constitute items unlocks near limitless potential. However, one of the biggest blockers keeping new applications from being built is adapting state-of-the-art, open source, and free resources to solve custom problems.</p><p>In this post, we’ll walk through how to prepare a custom dataset for object detection using tools that simplify image management, architecture, and training. In each section, we’ll first follow what I’ve done for a specific example and and then detail what modifications you’ll need to make for your custom dataset. My recommendation is that you follow along step-by-step to duplicate my process before adapting these steps to your problem.</p><p>Let’s start with a clear description of our process.</p><p>Any given machine learning problem begins with a well-formed problem statement, data collection and preparation, model training and improvement, and inference. Often, our process is not strictly linear. For instance, we may find our model performs very poorly on one type of image label, and we need to revisit collecting more data on that example.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/data-process.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>The general machine learning workflow.</em></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2><p>Chess is a fun game of wit and strategy. Improving your playing ability requires understanding where you’ve previously made notable mistakes and what move(s) a superior player to you may have made in the same situation. </p><p>Thus, having a system that recognizes the state of the game and records each move would be valuable. This requires not just determining what a given chess piece is, but where that piece is on the board—a leap from image recognition to object detection. For the purposes of this post, we will constrain the problem to focus on the object detection portion: <u>can we train a model to identify which chess piece is which and to which player (black or white) the pieces belong, and a model that finds at least half of the pieces in inference.</u></p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/computer-vision-problems-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image Processing Problems, adapted from Stanford’s CS231N course</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem statement</em>, consider constraining the problem space to a specific piece. Moreover, consider the minimal acceptable criteria for the model’s performance. (In this example, we are constraining to just the identification of correct bounding boxes, and setting a relatively low bar for acceptable criteria. To be more rigorous, we may want to identify our model’s <a href="https://giou.stanford.edu/">IOU</a> or <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">mAP</a> - but that is for <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">a different post</a>.)</p><hr><h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2><p>To identify chess pieces, we need to collect and annotate chess images.</p><p>I made a few assumptions in my data collection. First, all my images were captured from the same angle. I set up a tripod on the table near my chess board. For inference, this would require that my camera is at the same angle as the training data was captured — and not all chess players may be setting up tripods before their games. Second, I created 12 different classes: one for each of the six pieces times the two colors.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/IMG_0167.JPG" alt=""><figcaption>An (unlabeled) image example from our dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I collected 292 images. I labeled all the pieces in each of these images, totaling 2894 <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/glossary/#:~:text=annotation">annotations</a>. This <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full">chess dataset</a> is publicly available on <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Public Datasets</a>. For labelling, there are many high quality, free, and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/getting-started-with-labelimg-for-labeling-object-detection-data/">open source tools available like LabelImg</a>. I happened to use <a href="https://rectlabel.com/">RectLabel</a>, which is $3/month.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/rectLabel-example.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>An example image I labeled in RectLabel.</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem</em>, consider collecting images that are in-context of where your model will perform in production. This means ensuring you have a similar angles, lighting, quality, and objects in frame. The more situations your training set takes into account that your model may encounter in production, the better its performance will be. When labelling, it is best to draw bounding boxes that include the entirety of your objects, even if there’s a small amount of space between the object and the bounding box. Simply put, do not cut out any of the underlying object with your bounding boxes. If one piece blocks view (occludes) that of another, label as though you could see the full object (see the white-bishop and white-rook example above).</p><p>If you’re seeking already annotated images, consider <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection">object detection datasets</a> on sites like <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Public Datasets</a> which hosts a variety of free, high quality datasets.</p><hr><h2 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h2><p>Going straight from data collection to model training leads to suboptimal results. There may be problems with the data. Even if there aren’t, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/tag/augmentation/">applying image augmentation</a> expands your dataset and reduces overfitting.</p><p>Preparing images for object detection includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Verifying your annotations are correct (e.g. none of the annotations are out of frame in the images)</li><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/exif-auto-orientation/">Ensuring the EXIF orientation of your images is correct</a> (i.e. your images are stored on disk differently than how you view them in applications, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21207411">see more</a>)</li><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/you-might-be-resizing-your-images-incorrectly/">Resizing images and updating image annotations to match</a> the newly sized images</li><li>Various color corrections that may improve model performance like <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/when-to-use-grayscale-as-a-preprocessing-step/">grayscale</a> and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/when-to-use-contrast-as-a-preprocessing-step/">contrast adjustments</a></li><li>Formatting annotations to match the requirements of your model’s inputs (e.g. generating <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-create-to-a-tfrecord-file-for-computer-vision/">TFRecords for TensorFlow</a> or a flat text file for some <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov4">implementations of YOLO</a>).<br></li></ul><p>Similar to tabular data, cleaning and augmenting image data can improve your ultimate model’s performance more than architectural changes in your model.</p><p><a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Organize</a> is purpose-built to seamlessly solve these challenges.

This specific model is a one-shot learner, meaning each image only passes through the network once to make a prediction, which allows the architecture to be very performant, viewing up to 60 frames per second in predicting against video feeds. Fundamentally, <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov3-keras">YOLO is a convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> that divides an image into subcomponents, and conducts convolutions on each of those subcomponents before pooling back to create a prediction.

		<article>
			<p>Consider the meetup speaker.  She’s had a topic in mind for while, and so when the request went out for speakers, she volunteered.  But that was three months ago, and now the meetup’s only a few weeks away, and she hasn’t even begun.  She starts to outline the talk, but can’t quite figure out where to start.  She can explain all the details easily, but the order in which they should be introduced, the organizing structure of the talk, remains elusive.  Giving a talk about a subject, it turns out, is not the same as having a conversation about it.</p>

<p>Consider the first-time meetup attendee.  He’s been interested in the technology for a few months, but there doesn’t seem to be any guides that help him progress from the ubiquitous “hello world” or “distributed word count” examples to actual, effective production usage.  Maybe, he thinks, there will be some people at the meetup who can guide him through this awkward adolescence.  So after a long day at work, he wanders over to the meetup space, where everyone’s hanging around the open pizza boxes.  A few are eyeing the kegerator in the corner, wondering if it’s off-limits.  He stands next to them and eats his pizza, listening to their conversation, wondering if he should introduce himself or just wait for the talk to begin.</p>

<p>Consider the long-time meetup attendee.  He’s been using the technology for a few years, and wants its adoption to grow, so every month he comes to the meetup, eats the pizza, makes small talk with the other regular attendees, and dutifully listens to the talk.  The talk, unfortunately, is usually either too remedial or focused on something not very relevant to his day-to-day usage.  Also, the talks tend to be scattered, introducing concepts out of order, with lots of mental throat-clearing as the speaker tries to remember what was going through their head when they made the slide.  Usually within ten minutes half the audience is looking at their laptops, with only the occasional glance up to confirm that the talk is, in fact, still going on.  He attends almost every month, and often leaves wondering why he bothers.</p>

<p>In this based-on-a-true-story scenario, everyone’s motivations are good: they want to educate and to learn, to nurture and grow the community, to meet people who share their enthusiasm.  And yet, a typical meetup is at best weakly successful in all of these dimensions.  This is for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Any growing community is at least half-filled with novices.</strong>  Very few assumptions can be made about what vocabulary and concepts are universally understood.  The speaker needs to make a conscious choice to either build up from first principles, greatly delaying the time it takes to get to the actual topic at hand, or leave a significant part of the audience behind.</li>
  <li><strong>Understanding something well enough to use it doesn’t mean you can explain it well.</strong>  We should all aspire to a clarity of understanding that lets us easily explain an idea to people from a variety of backgrounds, but that doesn’t come for free.  Details need to be synthesized into broader concepts, without losing sight of the practical knowledge necessary to apply those concepts.  Unsurprisingly, speakers are often still ascending that learning curve.</li>
  <li><strong>The standard lecture format expects and enforces passive participation.</strong> Ostensibly the attendees are making an active choice to learn and grow by attending a meetup, but upon arriving all that’s expected of them is to eat and listen.  Each attendee likely has interests and projects of their own, but unless the talk directly addresses them, any discussion must be crammed into the margins of the meetup - either before, when people are eating and the speaker is fussing with the projector, or after, when the hosts are tidying up and giving not-so-subtle looks to everyone who’s lingering.</li>
</ul>

<p>The lecture format still has value, of course, but much less so than its widespread usage would suggest.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">Seeing Like a State</a>, James Scott contrasts two Ancient Greek words for knowledge, <em>techne</em> and <em>metis</em>.  <em>Techne</em> is universal and timeless: the Pythagorean theorem and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis">harmony of the spheres</a>.  <em>Metis</em> is local and contextual: Odysseus infiltrating Troy and escaping the Cyclops.  Our educations are anchored in <em>techne</em> - data structures, algorithms, and exams with objectively correct answers - but upon entering the real world, we find the <em>techne</em> only takes us so far.  The problems we solve are not universal, they’re bounded by the context of our particular domains.  This is fortunate, because needing to solve the general form of every problem we come across would slow our work to a standstill.  However, this means our <em>metis</em> is unavoidably tangled up in the context in which we developed it.</p>

<p>Looking back, leaving the <em>techne</em> of school for the <em>metis</em> of our jobs can feel like a fall from grace.  What was once clear is now hopelessly muddled, littered with a thousand half-remembered details.  The promise of the lecture format is a return to that higher plane, an escape from the endless minutiae that awaits below.  And yet, most of what we’ve learned in our careers is within that minutiae.  There is enormous practical knowledge available at every meetup, and the lecture format uses almost none of it.</p>

<p>And so, at Factual we’ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">a Clojure meetup</a> modeled on a different academic tradition: office hours.  At a university, students who have questions about the lecture content or coursework can visit the professor, and have a one-on-one conversation.  This can be enormously freeing for both parties: the student can ask questions without fear of looking stupid or holding up the rest of the class, and the professor can focus on giving an explanation that makes sense to this particular student, rather than the entire class.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every meetup, we give everyone a name tag, and provide a whiteboard with two columns, “teachers” and “students”.  Attendees are encouraged to put their name and interests in both columns.  From there, everyone can eat their food and read the whiteboard, and go in search of someone from the opposite column who shares their interests.  Typically they form groups of two or three, sometimes with a few more people listening in.</p>

<p>We’ve only had three meetups so far, each time with around twenty attendees, but the results have been promising.  It has been especially encouraging seeing novice Clojure users bring in their first project to get a critique of their approaches, and discuss how they can better use Clojure’s core abstractions.  These are precisely the sorts of conversations that create a healthy, growing community.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what the maximum practical size for this sort of meetup is.  Given the small size of each group it may scale fairly well, but at some point it becomes impossible for people to find each other.  Some sort of pre-event registration where people list their interests, and popular topics are assigned a physical location, may offset this.  However, for the vast majority of tech meetups, where the attendees number in the dozens rather than hundreds, this can be an enormously useful and engaging alternative to the lecture format.  We encourage everyone to give it a try.  And if you find yourself in San Francisco and have even a passing interest in Clojure, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">give us a visit</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to do interesting work, a great starting point is to work on things you find interesting. Instead of trying to optimize for what you think others are likely to find interesting—chasing the market is a Sisyphean task—just keep digging deeper into what <i>you</i>&nbsp;find interesting.</p><p>That way, making your work interesting to others is simply a matter of sharing your enthusiasm. I took a geology class my freshman year of college. It’s easy to imagine how boring a class about rocks could be. But my professor <i>loved</i>&nbsp;rocks. She had contributed to the discovery of plate tectonics. She took us up into the mountains and showed us how you could decode geological layers laid bare by erosion to reveal the violence and wonder of how the Earth took shape. She could forge a path through the entire universe starting from a single grain of sand. Another professor could have taught the same curriculum to no effect. My professor’s love for the material brought it to life. She used her enthusiasm to ignite our curiosity.</p><p>But working on things you find interesting is not sufficient to make your work interesting to other people. We’ve all been bored to death by experts who speak in impenetrable acronyms or super-fans who get lost in their own rabbit holes. Their individual interest in the material may be genuine, but it isn’t contagious because they lack empathy. You (probably) wouldn’t tell a dirty joke to your grandmother in the same way you’d tell it to your best friend. Empathy is meeting people where they are so you can take them someplace new. That’s why rock stars shout out the name of the city they happen to be performing in.

<p>Sunday morning while I was scrolling through my Twitter feed one tweet caught my eye,</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaScript</a> Challenge:</p><p>Can you make a TO-DO app within a single Tweet?

<p>The challenge was to make a todo app that fits in a single tweet, just like any other todo app, you should be able to add or remove tasks and clear the task list. I thought how hard this can get, I thought to myself this is doable just by using plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>So since I don’t have a laptop, what resulted was a whole day of torture having to code though my iPad on codepen.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain JavaScript</strong> </h2>
<p>Soon after I started using plain JavaScript it became obvious that I was not able to make it within one tweet, the DOM manipulation was taking too much characters<em>, document.createElements, document.getElements. </em></p>
<p>It was obvious that was not the right approach.</p>
<h2>Using vue</h2>
<p>Vue framework won’t require any build tools, so I don’t have to go through setting up Webpack,</p>
<p>Also I can easily create the DOM within the script tag using simple HTML. So that will save some characters for me in DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The first version I made use the <em>method</em> option in Vue app to handle button clicks, the button click event will call the function in methods to add new tasks and clear the task list.</p>
<p>However, I was unable to reduce it to one tweet. Then I went back to in-line functions, the same methods were added to button click events inline and not within the <em>methods</em> section.</p>
<p>Also I had to change buttons to anchor tags, in order to save some characters, and I had to use emojis instead of button text to save some more characters.</p>
<p>I also had to drop few buttons like a button to add a task, and instead I had to go with pressing enter key to add a task instead.</p>
<p>So I made the final version, the JavaScript code looked like this, </p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Then I ran the code through an online JavaScript minifier and then the whole HTML though an HTML minifier, and ended up with this piece of code,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://ruky.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="11676474517f746965">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input @keyup.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a @click="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a @click="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With my fingers crossed, I copied the code on to Twitter, and guess what it fits perfectly inside a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=<a href="https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ">https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input <a href="https://twitter.com/keyup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keyup</a>.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</p>— Rukshan (@JustRuky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1340862545322762240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>And here is the code in action, <a href="https://jsbin.com/venihiliha/1/edit?html,output">link</a> </p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">

on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>What I failed to achieve </h2>
<p>The original Tweet says, that the completed tasks should have a strike through.</p>
<p>But because css was costing me too much characters I had to fall back to remove completed tasks instead, but I’m sure someone will figure a solution for that as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think you can save even more characters by using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>, because you have short-codes for DOM elements as well, but I haven’t tried mithril in awhile.</p>
<h4>One last thing</h4>
<p>No I didn’t waste my whole Sunday on this problem, but I had to spend few hours, thinking and trying different versions. </p>
<p>I would have cut back some more time if I had a laptop. Somerimes I feel like buying an old laptop and refurbishing it and installing Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Sunday well spent? Absolutely yes.</p>
<h2>Best answer?</h2>
<p>One thing I love about HN is the fact that there are lot of bright minds out there. Since I posted this on HN I knew it was just a matter of time since someone figures this out.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best answer and also ticks all the boxes, well done.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;document.write(`&lt;style&gt;:checked+*{text-decoration:line-through}#t{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;p id="t"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;div id="f"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.appendChild(t.cloneNode(true)).id=''"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.innerHTML=''"&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;`)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>My daily driver is a desktop that I originally built as a Hackintosh for my wife's use. She outgrew it a year
or so ago for a new iMac, and I inherited it. Over the year, I've been using macOS less and less, and have spent
much more time on the dual-booted Windows 10 installation, especially since WSL is getting better and better
all the time. It's almost not painful to use for just about all the coding, writing, and occasional photography
or design projects I undertake.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I noticed while doing some file cleanup that there really was a terrific lot of crap that had
accumulated on the Windows drive. I'm fairly certain that this drive started out as a Windows 7 install, then
probably skipped Windows 8 and has been on Windows 10 through several Insider Ring upgrades over the years.
Anyway, I thought I'd just finish my backup and then re-install Windows to have a nice clean start. At the same
time, I figured since I wasn't really using the macOS installation that much, I'd move that one to a slower SATA
SSD and move Windows over to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KGpd3x">Western Digital 500GB NVMe M.2 drive</a> that previously
hosted the Hackintosh boot drive.</p>
<p>Based on my recollection of the last time I'd installed/updated Windows, it seemed like a reasonable afternoon
project that should be pretty straightforward. As it turns out, the actual installation of Windows 10 is even quicker
than I had remembered, but the getting to the point where installation was possible was more than I bargained for.</p>
<p>This is a write-up because I ran into a few problems that were difficult to find great answers for, and I'm sure
there's someone else out there who will get into a similar situation. That someone is most likely to be a future
version of me…</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 install media</strong></p>
<p>This is the easy part. I remembered having had issues in the past with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Windows Media Creation Tool</a>,
and so I went out of my way to download the plain old ISO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: if you want to do this you need to
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/">spoof your User-Agent</a>
if you're on Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-pro-tip: you probably don't need to do this. I ended up using WMCT and had no issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, if you want to get the ISO then you'll probably want something like <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> to help
you burn it into a USB thumb drive. As I mentioned above, during the course of about 15 installation attempts,
I ended up recreating the bootable media with WMCT and that's the version I ultimately successfully used. The
other failures weren't due to the ISO or Rufus, but it's probably easier to just use WMCT unless you have some
other burning reason not to.</p>
<p><strong>Hard drive prep</strong></p>
<p>I had already cleaned everything I needed off of the M.2 drive, and had reformatted it before leaving macOS.
The drive doesn't need to be in any particular state, format, or partitioning scheme - you can take care
of that in the Windows installer.</p>
<p>Some motherboards have little quirks about whether you can actually have more than one M.2 drive connected,
and if so, what other SATA ports you might lose access to, or which other PCIe slots get degraded lanes or
just stop working altogether. In my case, I'd already connected it up correctly several years ago and didn't
need to make any changes, but worth checking if you're using the M.2 drive for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>BIOS prep</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to skip all of the many, many things I tried that didn't work with BIOS settings for this, and
just make note of what I ended up finding was important. Obviously all BIOSs are different and so this won't
be an exact prescription unless you also happen to have a GIGABYTE GA-Z170X-UD5 on F21 BIOS version, but
it may be helpful nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>CSM needs to be turned off.</strong> This is Compatibility Support Module, and it (possibly among other things) will
force the boot media into MBR mode, and not UEFI mode. You want UEFI mode unless your motherboard is somehow
so old that it's not enabled. But if that were the case you're probably not trying to install Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>If you have CSM enabled, it's very likely that you'll see an error message like “Windows cannot be installed to this disk.
The selected disk is of the GPT partition style.”</p>

            <p>This may mean you have CSM enabled</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also needed to set <strong>Secure Boot to Disabled</strong> otherwise I couldn't even get to the BIOS screen… I needed to
hard-reset the CMOS a few times before I figured this out definitively.</p>
<p>The final setting that mattered was the <strong>“Windows 8/10 Features”</strong>, which needed to be set to “Windows 8/10”.
The WHQL setting isn't needed, and the “Other OS” had been my previous setting when the boot manager was
Clover from the Hackintosh EFI partition, but didn't work with a Windows EFI boot loader.</p>
<p>I also had “Fast Boot” turned off, but I don't think it should matter either way. All these settings (in my BIOS)
were under the tab labeled “BIOS”.</p>

<p>I don't know why this is a problem. Others seem to have it as well, but not consistently. I don't know if
it's related to this being a clean install with multiple internal hard drives connected, or to something
about USB 3.x vs USB 2.0 for the installer media, or maybe something entirely different. Either way, as I made
it through the initial few steps of the Windows 10 installation, I kept running into a failure with the error
message “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase of installation. To install Windows,
restart the installation.” Of course, restarting the installation doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>Before getting to this point, I had used the partition manager in the installer to delete all partitions from
the target NVMe drive, then chose the Unallocated Space on which to install Windows. I also tried creating
the partitions manually myself, with the same error message.</p>
<p>After much swearing both at the installer and the garbage that is the Microsoft Community Forums, I finally
found my way to a gentleman who went by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7a26b9f6-6f40-419f-a7bd-9fc6389899c8?sort=LastReplyDate&amp;dir=Desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;forum=allcategories&amp;meta=&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=undefined&amp;postedBefore=undefined&amp;threadType=All&amp;page=1">RichardKay1</a> and seemed
to have not only the same exact problem as I, but also a solution that <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-fresh-install-fails/f9614ae4-6dbd-4715-9a81-8586b16dfaf7?page=2">looked like it might have merit</a>.</p>
<p>His steps outlined on the forum were not exact, and mostly dealt with the <code>diskpart</code> utility, with which
I am not all that familiar, so I also spent some time trying to figure out how to safely use that tool
without deleting all the data on the 4 other disks that I had connected still.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: probably safer to disconnect all the other disks you're not using for the actual install
before messing around with <code>diskpart</code>. Unless you're very careful. Or brave/stupid.
I decline to identify into which category I fell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: <code>diskpart</code> can seriously ruin your day. BE CAREFUL BEFORE YOU HIT ENTER. You have been warned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Mr. RichardKay1, the root cause is that the USB installer <em>actually</em> tries to install Windows
onto the same USB stick, despite me having chosen an internal drive as the target. I don't really know how
to verify this, but regardless, his solution worked.</p>

<p>This is the key takeaway to solve the “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase
of installation”. Or it was in my case, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Reformat the target drive</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into the USB installer (I assume you can do this, else you probably the target audience.).</li>
<li>Select the language, time, and keyboard type, click Next.</li>
<li>Click “Repair your computer”, then “Troubleshoot”, then “Command Prompt”.</li>
</ol>
<p>This puts you on the X: drive (temporary RAM disk with some command line utilities) and able to access
the rest of the connected drives. First step is to fully erase the target disk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: it's up to you to choose the correct disks, and make sure that erasing them is actually what you
want to do!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>From the command prompt, type <code>diskpart</code> to start the utility. You'll get a little prompt like <code>DISKPART&gt;</code>
and not much else.</li>
<li>Type <code>list disk</code> to show all disks, and identify (by size or whatever) which is your target.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmd">DISKPART<span></span>&gt; list disk

  Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt

<ol start="6">
<li>Type <code>select disk 2</code> to choose this disk for manipulation.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: the next step will erase EVERYTHING on the disk you have selected!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Type <code>clean</code> to erase all partitions on this disk. If you run <code>list disk</code> again after this you should
see that the value in the “Free” column has gone up to the full drive capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prep the internal drive</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>We eventually want to boot in UEFI mode, and so need the partition scheme to be GPT. Type
<code>convert gpt</code> to accomplish this.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where I diverged a bit from the forum answer. I wanted to create a EFI partition manually so that
I could keep it big enough to later use <code>grub</code> for a dual-boot Linux install, and also to get the EFI partition
in the right spot on the disk so when I collapsed partitions later I wouldn't leave a gap.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Create an EFI partition with <code>create partition EFI size=500</code> (size is in MB).</li>
<li>Format the EFI partition to FAT32 (important) with <code>format FS=FAT32 label=System</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that EFI was ready to go, I wanted to create a ~10GB partition to hold the install media that was currently
on the USB thumb drive. The process is similar to creating the EFI partition except that it's a ‘primary’ partition
and formatted as NTFS:</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Create installer partition with <code>create partition primary size=10000</code>.</li>
<li>Format installer partition with <code>format quick FS=NTFS label=Installer</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, I needed to access files on both the installer USB and also on the new internal partition. To do that
I needed to assign a drive letter.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>To see what letters are assigned, type <code>list volume</code></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmd">DISKPART<span></span>&gt; list volume

  Volume ###  Ltr  Label        Fs     Type        Size     Status     Info
  ----------  ---  …</code></pre></div></div></div>

December 20, 2020 | https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>a popular trend in the Rust community is to ask "Are We X Yet" for various things that it would be nice to be able to develop easily in Rust - <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">game</a> and <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">web</a> are the most prominent ones as far as i can tell - and one such question is <a href="https://areweguiyet.com/">Are We GUI Yet</a>.
that's a good question; <em>are</em> we GUI yet?
Are We GUI Yet has a list of libraries for building GUIs: let's go through them in alphabetical order and see if we can build a simple to-do list with them without too much struggle.</p>
<p>some notes before we get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>this is all extremely subjective.</li>
<li>the only ui toolkits i have used and not hated are Swing (i know), Electron (<em>i know</em>), and wxWidgets, which doesn't have Rust bindings because Rust bindings to C++ libraries are generously described as a nuisance to create (i've tried, and i'm writing this post instead of trying harder).
as such, i might be using some of these wrong, who knows.</li>
<li>i use windows, and so anything that's a nuisance to set up on windows is not going to fare well regardless of how cool it is once you get it working.
it could be the best thing since sliced bread or Meteor on release and i wouldn't care.
do not @ me.</li>
<li>the people who wrote these libraries have done more than i have to make the rust gui ecosystem not suck, and i don't want any of this to come across as suggesting that they suck and their work is bad.
the strongest thing i want to say is that a library is not designed in a way that i would want it to be designed, or that it doesn't work for me.
doing this shit at all is really goddamn difficult, and i don't want to minimize that by being unhappy with the results.</li>
<li>i started drafting this post in early July 2020, and finished it in late August 2020.
some things may have changed in the meantime while i wasn't paying attention.</li>
</ol>
<h2>azul</h2>
<p>first on our list is <a href="https://azul.rs/">azul</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A free, functional, immediate-mode GUI framework for rapid development of desktop applications written in Rust, supported by the Mozilla WebRender rendering engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the wiki says we need cmake installed, which is never a good sign, but conveniently, i've already got that set up on my computer, for reasons i forget but probably didn't enjoy.
the runtime dependencies on linux are a mile long, but fortunately i don't have to care.
azul isn't currently available on crates.io for reasons that presumably exist but are difficult to explain, so we have to add it directly as a git dependency.</p>
<p>once we've got it added as a dependency, we can attempt to run our test crate, just to make sure everything's not on fire. unfortunately:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error: failed to run custom build command for `servo-freetype-sys v4.0.5`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `D:\Melody\Projects\we-are-not-gui-yet\target\debug\build\servo-freetype-sys-1fae054761ff82c5\build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
running: "cmake" &lt;snip&gt;

--- stderr
CMake Error: Could not create named generator Visual Studio 16 2019
</pre></div>
<p>this is an inauspicious beginning.
one version history crawl later and it looks like my cmake is from April 2019, which is not all that old but maybe they hadn't caught up on the latest visual studio yet, who knows.
this is already more work than i was prepared to do, but i've come this far, so it's time to update my cmake.</p>
<p>okay one installer later and it's time to try again.
armed with a cmake from May 2020, let's give this another shot:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
   --&gt; C:\Users\Melody\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\webrender_api-0.60.0\src\display_list.rs:270:35
    |
270 |             let reader = bincode::IoReader::new(UnsafeReader::new(&amp;mut self.data));
    |                                   ^^^^^^^^ could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
</pre></div>
<p>welp.
the cmake update fixed things, i guess, but now we've got a whole other pile of mess.
this might be fixable, it may have been fixed by the time you read this.
regardless, this library does not work for me.</p>
<h2>conrod</h2>
<p>next up is <a href="https://github.com/pistondevelopers/conrod">conrod</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An easy-to-use, 2D GUI library written entirely in Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i've actually used this one before in a couple of projects, but it's been a minute, so i forget the details.</p>
<p>they do not have a real tutorial, which is unfortunate, but they do have some examples.
unfortunately, step one is to pick which of the half dozen backends i want.
do i want glium or vulkano or rendy or piston?
do i look like i know what a vulkano is?
i just want a picture of a <a href="https://youtu.be/EvKTOHVGNbg">god dang hot dog</a>.
okay that's not quite fair, i recognize three of those and can infer from context what the fourth one is, but that's only because i've been down this road before, and i still have no clue which one is the right one to pick.
all the examples live under glium, though, so let's go with that.</p>
<p>wait actually i'm staring at these examples and there's an entire ass event loop in the support code for the examples.
something in here mentions a <code>GliumDisplayWinitWrapper</code> and i'm scared.
i have literally used this library before - on two different projects - and i'm at a loss.
i don't want to just copy and paste the examples without actually understanding what's going on, i can't understand what's going on in the examples, and there's nowhere else to get started.
so there goes that i guess.</p>
<h2>core-foundation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Bindings to Core Foundation for macOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh hey, it's an OS i don't have access to at all.
next.</p>
<h2>druid</h2>
<p>our next contender is <a href="https://linebender.org/druid/">druid</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Druid is a framework for building simple graphical applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>apparently this sprung out of that vi-like text editor a couple googlers were working on, so apparently it's at least possible to use it for real software.
there's a tutorial, they're on crates.io, they're describing it as "conceptually simple and largely non-magical" which i am always a fan of, i am cautiously optimistic.
if we throw it in our dependencies and just see if anything breaks, we find the surprising result that everything just works.</p>
<p>oh hey the first real chapter in the tutorial starts with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is outdated, and should be replaced with a walkthrough of getting a simple app built and running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you love to see it.
fortunately, we can just ignore that and skip to the hello world example, reproduced here in its entirety:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>{</span><span>AppLauncher</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>WindowDesc</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>};</span><span></span>
<span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>widget</span>::<span>Label</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>build_ui</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Label</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello world"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>AppLauncher</span>::<span>with_window</span><span>(</span><span>WindowDesc</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>build_ui</span><span>)).</span><span>launch</span><span>(())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>and somehow, this actually works.</p>
<p>the tutorial ends here, which is unfortunate, but there's more documentation, including explanations of core concepts with examples that are... todo lists!
with even more features than what i was planning to include here!
so that's convenient.
the UI hierarchy is based on CSS Flexbox, which i also appreciate.
this is what peak UI layout API looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>build_new_todo</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TodoState</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>textbox</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>TextBox</span>::<span>new</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_placeholder</span><span>(</span><span>"New todo"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>lens</span><span>(</span><span>TodoState</span>::<span>next_todo</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Button</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Add"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>on_click</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>data</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>TodoState</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>create_todo</span><span>());</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Flex</span>::<span>row</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_flex_child</span><span>(</span><span>textbox</span><span>.</span><span>expand_width</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_child</span><span>(</span><span>button</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>1 hour and 80 lines of code later, we've got ourselves a perfectly valid and working todo list!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.boringcactus.com/assets/2020-08-21-survey-of-rust-gui-libraries-1.png" alt="our sample druid application, showing a todo list"></p>
<p>i'm not quite happy with this, though: we can type text and hit the button and it adds the todo, but pressing enter in the text field doesn't do anything.
there's no way out-of-the-box to make that happen; let's see if we can build that ourselves.</p>
<p>~30 lines of code later, we've got it!
the <code>Controller</code> trait is designed for exactly this sort of thing, when you need to wrap the behavior of an existing component and intercept some events to inject your own logic.</p>
<p>if you're curious, you can take a look at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~boringcactus/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries/tree/main/druid-test">the source for our druid example</a>.</p>
<p>so apparently druid is actually pretty darn usable.
i only have a couple tiny issues with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>it doesn't use platform native UI widgets, so it doesn't look quite like a windows app should, and it won't look quite like a mac or linux app should either if i test it there.
this one is a feature as far as some people are concerned, but i am not on that list.</li>
<li>accessibility features like being able to tab between UI widgets (<em>update 2020-12-14</em>: and also literally any screen reader support) are missing, so you'd have to roll those yourself in a real application.
 maybe they'll add that by default in future versions, maybe not, but it would be neat if it existed.</li>
<li>high-level documentation is incomplete.
the individual struct/function docs are really good, but at a high level you don't really have a convenient place to jump in.</li>
</ol>
<p>i was about to add "no support for web" to that list, but even though the high-level docs don't mention it, the crate root docs and the examples do.
on the plus side, it just works, and i didn't have to make any changes to my code because i use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/736">this patch to wasm-pack that lets you just use binary crates in wasm-pack</a> even though it hasn't been merged yet upstream.
on the minus side, it points everything at a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag, which means you get none of the accessibility features of actually using the DOM.
so that one's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>but yeah, overall druid is perfectly usable for gui development.
i was originally calling this post "we are not gui yet" but i guess we are at least a little bit gui already.
pleasant surprises are the best kind.</p>
<h2>fltk</h2>
<p>following up that success is <a href="https://github.com/MoAlyousef/fltk-rs">fltk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FLTK crate is a crossplatform lightweight gui library which can be statically linked to produce small, self-contained and fast gui applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cross-platform and statically linked are both good things.
the upstream FLTK website makes my eyes bleed, which is never a good sign for a UI library, but that doesn't mean much one way or the other.
the simple hello world example is once again a mere handful of lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>fltk</span>::<span>{</span><span>app</span>::<span>*</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>window</span>::<span>*</span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>app</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>App</span>::<span>default</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>wind</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Window</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3…</span></pre></div></div></div>

    <p>It’s that time of year again where I’m fiddling around with Z3Py. I’m booting it back up because I’m scheduled to do a <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/agenda.html">tutorial on Z3</a> on Feb 3. It’s kind of silly because I probably already have too much content, and the tutorial is aimed at newbies, but there are some fun new things that I’ve learned in the last year I can do in Z3. As one example, it’s not so hard to build a pretty reasonable simulacrum of TLA+ in Z3.</p>

<p><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> is a modelling/specification language for computational processes. It is particularly useful for modeling concurrency, where our intuitions fail us <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/">http://deadlockempire.github.io/</a>. It’s the mind child of Leslie Lamport, the same guy behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. The language doesn’t aim for deep verification of your actual code as is sometimes the goal with tools like Coq, but because of that it is significantly more lightweight and easy to use. 
The <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox</a> is a freely available IDE and checker to TLA+, but I think it is kind of a neat idea to replicate something in the flavor of TLA+ in all too familiar python. By leveraging Z3, we can get a lot of logical mileage and solver power for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial">Z3</a> is an SMT solver. Its input language <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml">smtlib2</a> is a kind of typed first order logic with special support for things like booleans, integers, reals, bitvectors, and algebraic datatypes. You can ask Z3 if propositions are valid, or if not it can provide a counterexample. It works pretty crazy good, especially if you work around its weaknesses (mostly quantifiers and nasty nonlinear stuff). Z3 has top class performance and its <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">python bindings</a> are widely regarded as very good.</p>

<p>The main unusual things TLA brings into play compared to bog standard logics is the primed variables \(x'\), representing the values of variables at the next time step, and some temporal operators like always \(\Box\) and eventually \(\Diamond\).</p>

<p>We could mark primes by creating variables in pairs</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>z3</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>xnxt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ints</span><span>(</span><span>"x x'"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I’ve chosen to mark the prime variables using a special uninterpreted function, which we strip out later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>nxt</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span># next is a special function for generators in python, so we shouldn't use that name
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>is_const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>decl</span><span>().</span><span>kind</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Z3_OP_UNINTERPRETED</span><span>:</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>"nxt"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One breakage here as compared to with TLA+ is the use of types. TLA+ curiously insists on a lack of intrinsic types and argues against them as a foundational feature. Types are instead propositions that are proved in the system. This just is really not convenient for using with Z3, so from the get-go I’m going to take liberties.</p>

<p>We can implement an <code>always</code> operator via a fairly simple procedure, we just roll out the execution of any formula for <code>n</code> time steps. This is the trick of bounded model checking. This rollout can be achieved by using the Z3 <code>substitute</code> function, a surprisingly useful little fellow.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful with using always. Arbitrarily nesting it’s usage may give unexpected results. Lamport makes an argument that specs very rarely do or should make sophisticated use of the temporal operators. Maybe this is good enough or maybe there is a way to patch this up.</p>

<p>Z3 does in fact return a counter model that fills the buckets up as desired.</p>

<p>TLA+ has a tendency to use functions/records which are not so obvious how to encode. There are different ways of going about this. One aspect of playing around with Z3py is that it makes extremely clear the existence of the logic language and a metalanguage. The logic is Z3 expressions, but the metalanguage is python and they are obviously very different. But there is often a choice of whether to encode things in the logic vs the metalanguage. It is usually better I think to encode as much in python as possible if you can get away with it. Z3 likes piles of simple constraints more than it likes complicated quantifiers and things.</p>

<p>For example, we can want to encode an Enum type in python or in Z3.</p>

<p>Downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very ad hoc. The use of special autogenerated names is a great way to inadvertently smash things together</li>
  <li>TLA syntax is designed to be readable. The python adds a lot of noise</li>
  <li>TLA toolbox can format specs nicely using latex.</li>
  <li>TLA has a lot of thought gone into it. Making changes to it in an afternoon of thought is probably not to be trusted</li>
</ul>

<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better fits Z3, so we get good automation from the get go</li>
  <li>python is lingua franca of computing. It is comforting compared to TLA+, even if Z3py might be discomfiting.</li>
  <li>Having to download the toolbox and figure out how to use it is always going to be a slight speedbump. There is a TLA+ vscode extension now though. That might help</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python ast parsing <a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, we could probably use regular simple python syntax as a PlusCal like DSL and compile it into the above Z3-TLA+ hybrid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the CHOOSE operator of TLA+ will be easy to implement. It kind of seems like it requires nested solves? Can it be encoded using</p>

<p>I don’t particularly understand the TLA+ module system yet and I’m not so sure how to emulate it. Python modules might be one way, or perhaps classes.</p>

<p>Although I tried to copy exactly, perhaps one shouldn’t spec in precisely the style of standard TLA+.</p>

<p>I mean, is this even up for argument?</p>

<p>One of the whitest-ass things in the world is our people’s obsession with songs at sporting events, and indeed, in large crowds. If you’re reading this and you’re from Europe, feel free to replace my references to Sweet Caroline with Seven Nation Army, same diff. That said, you can fairly reliably trigger this behavior in most cultures in most parts of the world by finding a sufficiently rowdy bar around midnight and playing <em>something</em> on the jukebox that gets folks going. Humans, we’re social creatures, yeah? A few bars of Neil Diamond, a couple people singing along, and by the time you’re at ‘Hands, touching hands’ you’ll have a swelling crescendo that culminates in a ear-shattering and atonal screech of ‘SWEEEEEEEEEEEEET CAR-O-LINE (WOAH OH OH)’ making the bartenders silently plot the murder of everyone in their line of sight.</p>
<p>People like being around people, and most people don’t treat everyone around them as some sort of incredibly delicate faberge egg. There’s a lot of “wow look at all these accomodations people are making that disabled people have asked for now that nobody is supposed to leave their house! hypocrisy, much??” and I’m like, yeah, duh? Pointing out hypocrisy is the lowest form of engagement in 2020. This is why virtual events suck – because nobody is actually planning on doing them any longer than they need to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the benefits of in-person conferences is that they temporarily remove you from your day-to-day work and immerse you in a community of like-minded individuals. It’s not just about getting to hear new ideas, but also about the break from your daily routine. This is one of the things that is hardest to replicate in a virtual event. DIDevOps was perhaps the most successful virtual conference I’ve seen in making their event feel like An Event. This event was clever and whimsical, the community was engaged, and it definitely didn’t feel like just another video call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2020/04/30/deserted-island-devops/">Rachel Stephens, RedMonk</a></p>
<p>I wrote earlier this year about the idea of a <a href="https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/">decisive moment</a> and how that influenced the thinking behind Deserted Island DevOps. To elaborate a bit, Cartier-Bresson was a street photographer who coined this phrase in the introduction to his 1947 book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is, then, the ‘decisive moment’ of a tech conference? My original criteria was that an event was <em>etherial</em> or placeless; From the smallest DevOpsDays to the largest re:Invent, an event is defined less by the where than by the who. As an attendee, you are swept away from the status quo for a time (even as it inorexably pulls you back in, given the amount of people I see working on laptops during events) into a convention center or hotel or theater or whatever, specifically to focus on something other than what you normally would. Quite literally, you are being moved out of your comfort zone. This can prime you to accept ideas that normally you wouldn’t, can rejigger your brain chemistry for a few hours to make you see things from a different perspective. That’s valuable! As a speaker, you’re transported to a new stage, with a new audience, a new set of eyes and ears to reflect off of. It’s almost like being a comedian and testing out material – you try some new lines, some new jokes, add an anecdote here, shave one off there. Repetition builds mastery. Next week, or next month, you’re going to do it all again. Our traversal through the liminal spaces between these potemkin stages lends itself to inward focus where we must Do The Work to shut out the world around us. To be less floral about it, the demands of the road make us better speakers because the only way we don’t go fuckin’ mad is to focus on the work.</p>
<p>Virtual events offer none of this, unfortunately. As attendees, another Slack, another Zoom call, another wave of talking heads and PowerPoint. As speakers, our audience disappears behind a chat window. We lose our reflection. It’s sad and terrible and great for some people, but on the balance I think we dislike it more than we like it.</p>
<p>The bad is part of the fun! You can’t replicate the feeling of gnawing on an underripe banana while chugging overly-hot-but-not-terribly-flavorful coffee watching someone who’s company paid way too much for a keynote while mentally ticking off the people you need to talk to that day while working out the soreness in your back from the bed that isn’t yours that you got maybe four productive sleeping hours in due to jet lag while figuring out who you’re going to catch up with after the show wraps that day as you muse about how it looks like your competitors have a much nicer booth than yours, and you wonder if they’re hiring except that one asshole still works there and so on and so forth. “That sounds terrible!” you may be musing, <em>and you’d be right</em>, but I love the terrible. I thrive in the terrible. I’m drinking single origin fair trade coffee beans that were roasted in small batches locally brewed in a fancy coffee maker and I can tell you that when this is all over and I can have a cuppa brewed in the backroom of a Hilton it is going to be the sweetest thing I can possibly imagine for five seconds right before I start hating everything about it again and <em>that’s fine</em>.</p>
<p>The bad of an in-person event is terrible, but it’s a terrible I can work with. I go outside like once or twice a week now to get groceries and that’s all I’ve done for the past nine months. <em>I want the workable terrible, not this horrific stasis</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that virtual events suck is that we’re trying to replicate in-person events. We’re doing old-school iOS skeumorphism but for primarily social gatherings. No wonder they suck! There’s a few broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad UX</em>: Sometimes I like to style on babies by displaying object permanance, but you wouldn’t know that given the utter contempt event platforms seem to have for their audiences by doing dumb skeumorphic “conference halls” with badly ‘shopped people standing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://aparker.io/images/kubeconlobby.png" alt="KubeCon EU ‘Lobby’"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pervasive Surveillence</em>: I use ad blockers but a bunch of people don’t, on principle though it’s really fuckin’ creepy that every click you make on one of these event platforms is tracked. Simply navigating to a sponsor booth counts as a ‘lead’ to the sponsor. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor AV Quality</em>: I get that people have to record from their homes but maybe recording someone’s Zoom isn’t the best way to do this? I’m sympathetic, this is legit a hard problem to solve, but many large conferences are still charging an arm and a leg to sponsors (and less for attendees but that’s a different point) so how about you do local recording then edit things later? If you’re going to charge me at <em>all</em> then I expect the production values to at least beat out a random Twitch streamer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Viewing Experience</em>: A tiny pop-out 720p video that artifacts when I change the size is… not great. Integrate chat and Q&amp;A better. Do <em>something</em> unique with the format. I sit on enough Zoom calls. Like, why would I <em>pay money</em> to <em>watch videos</em> with a <em>worse player than YouTube</em>? There’s millions of hours of shit out there for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet Another Slack</em>: I just don’t want to join more Slack channels where people are randomly @here’ing and I never know if it’s an event organizer with an announcement or some salesperson trying to coax people into their virtual booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Did I Mention Virtual Booths Yet</em>: I have never interacted with anyone in a Virtual Booth and I never will. This appears to be a common sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s flip the script. I’m wearing my business hat now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bad UX</em>: You think the <em>attendee</em> experience is bad, the admin/sponsor controls and views on these platforms is worse. Arbitrary requirements, poor control over look and feel, nah fam miss me with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Interactivity</em>: You know what’s great about a real booth? People wander by and they get interested. Why do they wander by? Because they’re not at home, they need to kill time, and the snacks are on the trade floor. Maybe they just want a t-shirt or whatever, fine, but we do actually get a lot of really valuable feedback and eyes on the product by doing demos. This is extremely useful, and it simply doesn’t happen at virtual events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attendee Impedence Mismatch</em>: This is more of a theory but I suspect that the attendee mix for virtual events in terms of titles is significantly out-of-balance compared to in-person events. One popular (<em>n</em> = ~1300) virtual event this year had self-reported attendance of only 4% for management roles, but over 40% IC (developer/devops/ops) roles. My hypothesis is that “decision makers” are less likely to attend virtual events because they’re intensely overbooked during the in-person -&gt; distributed team transition period and are oversubscribed on other things, which translates into less useful direct sales conversations, but I could be off-base here. If nothing else, my anecdata from talking about this seems to indicate that attendees just don’t really go to virtual booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success Looks Different</em>: This is one of those ‘two-way street’ problems, but I don’t think organizers did a great job in general making sponsors successful, and I don’t think sponsors had the muscle to make themselves successful in a lot of ways. Trying to be too different caused a lot of friction, however, and during a time of reinvention this friction reduced experimentation in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last part - the speaker experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>My Home Is Not Your Home</em>: One of the low key worst things about the pandemic has been the idea of us ‘opening up our homes’ and letting people see how we live. Could we fuckin’ not? Like I don’t believe that I even have to discuss this but we should probably put the Room Rater person on trial for crimes against humanity. I don’t <em>want</em> to have to be super concious about my webcam or audio or whatever, I don’t <em>want</em> to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<h4>This classic article from Mario Wolczko first
appeared on Usenet in 1986.  </h4>

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you
came back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "<kbd>rm -rf
~/*</kbd>" and was hovering over the keyboard with threats along the
lines of "<em>lend me a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return</em>"?
Undoubtedly the person in question would not have had the nerve to
inflict such a trauma upon you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've
probably never experienced the worst of such disasters....<p>


It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "<em>Mario, I'm having a little
trouble sending mail.</em>" Knowing that msg was capable of confusing
even the most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to
see what was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget
the exact details) "<kbd>cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147</kbd>"
had been issued by msg.  My first thought was "<em>Who's userid 147?;
the sender of the message, the destination, or what?</em>" So I leant
over to another terminal, already logged in, and typed</p><blockquote>        <kbd>grep 147 /etc/passwd</kbd></blockquote>

<p>only to receive the response</p><blockquote>        <kbd>/etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</kbd></blockquote>

Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to<blockquote>        <kbd>ls /etc</kbd></blockquote>

<p>I got</p><blockquote>        <kbd>ls: not found.</kbd></blockquote>

I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.<p>

When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was
beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.  And at
the top of the screen I spied the following lines:</p><blockquote>
        <kbd># cd <br>
        # rm -rf *</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.</p><p>


I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory
is just a blur.  I do remember trying <kbd>ls</kbd> (again),
<kbd>ps</kbd>, <kbd>who</kbd> and maybe a few other commands beside,
all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was being at my terminal
again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and typing</p><blockquote>
        <kbd>cd /<br>
        echo *</kbd>
</blockquote>
<p>I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making <kbd>echo</kbd> a
built-in of his shell; needless to say, <kbd>/bin</kbd>, together
with <kbd>/bin/echo</kbd>, had been deleted.  What transpired in the
next few minutes was that <kbd>/dev</kbd>, <kbd>/etc</kbd> and
<kbd>/lib</kbd> had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted <kbd>rm</kbd> while it was somewhere down below
<kbd>/news</kbd>, and <kbd>/tmp</kbd>, <kbd>/usr</kbd> and
<kbd>/users</kbd> were all untouched.</p><p>


Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved what
claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four weeks
earlier.  The pressing question was, "<em>How do we recover the
contents of the tape?</em>".  Not only had we lost
<kbd>/etc/restore</kbd>, but all of the device entries for the tape
deck had vanished.  And where does <kbd>mknod</kbd> live?  You
guessed it, <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  How about recovery across Ethernet of
any of this from another VAX?  Well, <kbd>/bin/tar</kbd> had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put <kbd>rcp</kbd> in
<kbd>/bin</kbd> in the 4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the
Ether stuff wanted to know without <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> at least.
We found a version of <kbd>cpio</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>, but
that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape deck.</p><p>


Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.</p><p>


So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a
device descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where
<kbd>cc</kbd>, <kbd>as</kbd> and <kbd>ld</kbd> live.  Or maybe make
skeletal entries for <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>, <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd>
and so on, so that <kbd>/usr/bin/ftp</kbd> would work.  By sheer
luck, I had a <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd> still running in one of my windows,
which we could use to create <kbd>passwd</kbd>, etc., but the first
step was to create a directory to put them in.  Of course
<kbd>/bin/mkdir</kbd> had gone, and so had <kbd>/bin/mv</kbd>, so we
couldn't rename <kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  However, this
looked like a reasonable line of attack.</p><p>


By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and as
luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
<kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>, or make <kbd>/etc</kbd>, assemble
it on another VAX, <kbd>uuencode</kbd> it, type in the uuencoded file
using my gnu, <kbd>uudecode</kbd> it (some bright spark had thought
to put <kbd>uudecode</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd>), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still <kbd>su</kbd>'d to root (<kbd>su</kbd> is in
<kbd>/bin</kbd>, remember?), so at least we stood a chance of all
this working.</p><p>


Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create
<kbd>/etc</kbd>.  The stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we
converted it to hex (slightly more readable than the output of
<kbd>uuencode</kbd>), and typed it in using my editor.  If any of you
ever have the same problem, here's the hex for future reference:</p><blockquote>
   <kbd>070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f<br>
		8800040000bc012f65746300</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of <kbd>/usr/bin/sum</kbd>
tallied with our original binary.  But hang on---how do you set
execute permission without <kbd>/bin/chmod</kbd>?  A few seconds
thought (which as usual, lasted a couple of minutes) suggested that
we write the binary on top of an already existing binary, owned by
me...problem solved.

So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a <kbd>/etc</kbd>,
writable by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating
<kbd>passwd</kbd>, <kbd>hosts</kbd>, <kbd>services</kbd>,
<kbd>protocols</kbd>, (etc), and then <kbd>ftp</kbd> was willing to
play ball.  Then we recovered the contents of <kbd>/bin</kbd> across
the ether (it's amazing how much you come to miss <kbd>ls</kbd> after
just a few, short hours), and selected files from <kbd>/etc</kbd>.
The key file was <kbd>/etc/rrestore</kbd>, with which we recovered
<kbd>/dev</kbd> from the dump tape, and the rest is history.</p><p>


Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this
story?  Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal
words, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong>.  Our initial reaction was to
reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's
unlikely it would have come up without <kbd>/etc/init</kbd> and
<kbd>/bin/sh</kbd>.  Rational thought saved us from this one.</p><p>


The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd>, we could have
survived by using, say, <kbd>/usr/bin/grep</kbd> as a substitute for
<kbd>/bin/cat</kbd>.</p><p>


And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (<kbd>/bin/login</kbd>?), and most of the useful
commands had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some
things can't stand life without say <kbd>/etc/termcap</kbd>, or
<kbd>/dev/kmem</kbd>, or <kbd>/etc/utmp</kbd>, but by and large it
all hangs together.</p><p>


I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the same
situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?

<p>In contrast, <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/1334862797822373889">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1334796914831855617">Sara Soueidan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/brucel/status/1334818455275626499">Bruce Lawson</a>, and more (principal) web developers seem to agree that CSS is hard to master. It’s interesting how experts say CSS is hard, while a group of people who specialise in other technology say otherwise.</p>
<p>I feel we, the community, have to acknowledge that CSS is easy to get started with and hard to master. Let’s reflect on the language and find out what makes it hard.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-and-common-properties"><a href="#syntax-and-common-properties">#</a> Syntax And Common Properties</h2>
<p>Back in 2013, Hugo “Kitty” Giraudel published <a href="https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/15/css-is-easy/">CSS is Easy</a>, in which they also write about how CSS is perceived as easy. In the article, Kitty makes an excellent point: “CSS is easy… syntactically.” I wholeheartedly agree. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>body</span> {
  <span>background-color</span>: black;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>body</span> {
    <span>background-color</span>: white;
    <span>color</span>: black;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this snippet, you can see much of the syntax used in CSS. There are selectors, declarations, I even added an at-rule (<code>@media</code>). The properties and values in this example are straight-forward; they just work. The at-rule, although syntactically simple, adds some cognitive load to understanding this snippet. It creates a relationship between what’s inside and outside the at-rule. In other words, to determine what colour the <code>body</code> is, we have to parse the entire file mentally.</p>
<p>This snippet isn’t too complex, but as we get more code the number of relationships (like the at-rule) do too.</p>
<h2 id="a-web-of-relationships"><a href="#a-web-of-relationships">#</a> A Web Of Relationships</h2>
<p>Syntax and basic properties are pretty easy, indeed. However, the learning curve of CSS quickly gets steeper when you start dealing with various relationships. Let’s look at some.</p>
<h3 id="property-sets"><a href="#property-sets">#</a> Property Sets</h3>
<p>Many properties are part of a set, meaning you may need several others to make one work. For instance, the <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and the <code>z-index</code> properties are ignored until you add the <code>position</code> property and set it to anything but <code>static</code>. That means that you have to learn a couple of properties of a set and how they relate to each other before being able to use one. If you’re unaware which properties rely on others, it can be extremely frustrating because it may appear that a declaration just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s not always obvious which pieces of the set are declared. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>.snackbar</span> {
  <span>position</span>: fixed;
  <span>bottom</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>left</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>right</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>.snackbar</span> {
    <span>bottom</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>left</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>right</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we look at the first rule, we can easily tell how an element with the <code>snackbar</code> class would be positioned on our page. If we look at the second rule, the one in the <code>@media</code> at-rule, we’re not so sure. We’d have to look up the <code>.snackbar</code> rule outside the at-rule. This example is fairly obvious, but it can get pretty obscure. The <code>position: fixed</code> declaration could be set elsewhere, on another selector, or inline.</p>
<h3 id="the-dom"><a href="#the-dom">#</a> The <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr></h3>
<p>We can’t determine which styles are applied just by looking at your CSS. The HTML, or rather the DOM, also affects them. We have to consider the tag name of the element, its attributes, its siblings, its parents all the way up to the root node, and all relevant styles. If you render HTML server- or client-side, all of this may be dynamic and influenced by the application state.</p>
<p>The adjacent sibling combinator (<code>+</code>) is a simple example of how HTML influences CSS. The following style is only applied when a <code>li</code> is followed by another:</p>
<pre><code><span>li</span> + <span>li</span> { <span>margin-top</span>: <span>1rem</span>; }
</code></pre>
<p>This example is quite expressive but doesn’t have to be. Another example that took me a while to get as a beginner was using <code>position: absolute</code> on an element with a parent with <code>position: relative</code>. The element with <code>position: absolute</code> is positioned relative to the viewport or relative to an ancestor element with <code>position: relative</code>. In order to place this <code>absolute</code> element correctly in the interface, we have to know whether the element sits in a container with <code>position: relative</code>. Again, we’d have to look at the DOM, and at all it’s states, to be sure this is the case.</p>
<p>A similar, perhaps more familiar, example is the <code>flex</code> property. It only works if the element is a direct child of an element with the <code>display: flex</code> declaration.</p>
<p>When we write CSS, we always have to consider the DOM.</p>
<h3 id="cascade"><a href="#cascade">#</a> Cascade</h3>
<p>Let’s say I want text and links in the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to be red. We might write the following CSS:</p>
<pre><code><span>nav</span> { <span>color</span>: red; }
<span>nav</span> <span>a</span> { <span>color</span>: inherit; }
</code></pre>
<p>These two simple declarations imply various relationships. The link colour is now dependent on the colour of the text. Because of that, we can set the text colour of the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element and the link will inherit this colour. If we remove either of these two declarations, the link colour won’t be red anymore.</p>
<p>The flexibility cascade gives has its benefits, but it’s not hard to imagine that it can get difficult to track the relationships between all styles. It’s no surprise that many opt to use cascade as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility"><a href="#compatibility">#</a> Compatibility</h2>
<p>Designing an interface with CSS that doesn’t break is no easy task. There are numerous devices, browsers, resolutions, and users we have to take into account. We can also account for device settings, like dark mode using <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark/light</code>. On top of that, there are often various conditions in the interface that affect the styling as well.</p>
<p>Every combination of all these states and overrides have to be taken into account to produce the right output style. Again, this is no easy feat. It often involves a lot of tools and testing during and after development.</p>
<h2 id="maintainability"><a href="#maintainability">#</a> Maintainability</h2>
<p>Like all other code, CSS should be clean, readable, and maintainable. We can group styles into various files, or prefix selectors, but all rules live globally. This is a challenge, but also greatly contributes to keeping the code <abbr title="Don’t Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>.</p>
<p>I earlier explained various types of relationships in CSS. They play a part in maintainability as well. Some of the methodologies used in CSS — like atomic design, <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr>, <abbr title="Inverted Triangle CSS">ITCSS</abbr>, and others — help to keep the coupling in check. They’re similar to paradigms and best practises in programming, and also steepen the learning curve and requires additional knowledge.</p>
<p>Then there are also preprocessors. We have a lot of them (e.g. PostCSS, Sass, LESS, and Stylus) at our disposal to do things we can’t do with vanilla CSS. This usually improves maintainability but does add another layer of complexity.</p>
<p>Finally, not unlike other languages, there often are various solutions to one problem. A common example is deciding between <code>display: inline-block</code>, the <code>float</code> property, flexbox, or grid to horizontally stack a list of items. Each has its pros and cons. When mentoring beginners, I found this is a challenge for them. It’s also difficult to convey the differences of these options — that are often subtle — and which is the most robust in a given situation.</p>
<p>All together, maintainability in CSS is a tradeoff. The code gets more complex syntactically and bound by self-imposed rules, but (hopefully) reduces the effort it takes to understand and modify the code.</p>
<h2 id="concluding"><a href="#concluding">#</a> Concluding</h2>
<p>CSS may seem simple at first, but the learning curve isn’t linear; mastering it is hard. By no means is the language perfect, but it’s amazingly efficient at what it’s designed to do. Despite its simple syntax, there’s little it can’t do.</p>
<p>I think mastering CSS comes down to having a good amount of knowledge about it, recognising the subtle dependencies between different declarations, rules, and the DOM, understanding how they make your CSS complex, and how to best avoid them. Reaching that point is naturally frustrating because you will run into code that is a tangled mess where the tiniest edit might change the interface in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>I worry that the way we think about CSS might affect how beginners perceive the language. If they are taught that CSS is easy, they might be discouraged from seeking help when they struggle or just blame the language. Admitting you struggle with something is difficult enough. Let’s not make it worse for them.</p>
<p>I feel it’s better if we acknowledge the complexity of writing CSS. We might also stop looking down on CSS specialists. Today, they’re often considered half a developer, whilst (JavaScript) software engineers (or UI engineers, or whatever they’re called nowadays) that know little about the complexities of CSS are considered full-fledged front-end developers. We see this on social media, in job openings, and in pay.</p>
<p>Thanks to Danielle, Hidde, Sven, and Thijs for reviewing this post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><em>Update:</em> See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491568">Hacker News thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kh6ox0/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/programming</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kh6gh2/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/kh1p0a/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/gamedev</a> posts for discussions on this article and Cakelisp.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new programming language since the end of August 2020. It is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/makuto/cakelisp/">Github</a>, and mirrored on <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/">my site</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a working example first, <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame.cake</a> is a simple audio looper with Ogre 3D graphics and SDL for windowing, input, and audio. This demo supports code hot-reloading and doesn't require an external build system, only Cakelisp. You can also check <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/src/branch/master/runtime/Macros.cake">Macros.cake</a>, which demonstrates some use-cases for compile-time code.</p>
<p>I figured showing non-trivial examples would be much more interesting. It also proves that Cakelisp is working.</p>

<p>Cakelisp is built for me first, but it should appeal to fellow programmers who know what they're doing and want to try a more powerful language.</p>
<p>Cakelisp might be for you if you want…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncompromised performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust in you, the programmer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code generation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the things in that list don't make sense to you, or you think you're already getting them in language <em>X</em>, then Cakelisp isn't for you, and that's okay! We have different domains and different problems, so it makes some sense to use different languages and methodologies.</p>
<p>While many languages have these features, few have the combination of all three. Lisp has extremely powerful code generation, but makes serious performance compromises. C is great for performance but can require extremely repetitive code writing to accomplish tasks a simple code generator could handle. Rust is fast (well, apart from compilation, which is very important for iterative development to be productive), but doesn't trust the programmer.</p>

<p>My goal is to "have my cake and eat it too", meaning all three of these features in one coherent package. Importantly, there isn't one dominating principle in Cakelisp (no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Big Idea</a>). I've found that the small things like removing the need for header files, no longer dealing with external build systems, or being able to run Cakelisp files like scripts, end up making a big difference when combined in one package.</p>
<p>It is useful to go over the goals in detail so you can understand my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromised-performance">Uncompromised performance</h2>
<p>This means no garbage collection, no type boxing/unboxing, etc. Fewer abstractions (besides the ones you create) between you and what the computer is actually doing. Idiomatic usage of the language should result in performance comparable with C (in most cases, it should be identical, because it's only a thin layer on C).</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-you-the-programmer">Trust in you, the programmer</h2>
<p>While languages like Rust offer benefits in terms of security and stability, they cost programmers in terms of productivity. It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it's much less valuable when safety isn't as important (e.g. in games).</p>
<p>In a perfect world all programs would be as robust as space flight software, but in reality, that level of robustness is unnecessary for most programs. It's important to realize that the safety focus is just one way of doing things, not the <em>One True Way</em> or anything.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-generation">Powerful code generation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most languages offer far too little opportunity for the programmer to automate the actual writing of code. This power also relates to trusting in the programmer, because gone wild, the code can become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The company I work for has what I consider to be a state-of-the-art code generator built for the company's use-case: multi-platform MMOs. It's used very effectively on serialization, RPC, automatic commands, monitoring, automatic documentation, and more.</p>
<p>To give more credence to the use of code generation in games, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/index.html">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiJqUWfR90I">Naughty Dog</a> also rely on code generation.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-project-setup-and-management">Simplify project setup and management</h2>
<p>I want to dramatically reduce time wasted on C++ project set-up and "code logistics". This includes setting up build systems, creating header files, adding and managing new C/C++ 3rd party libraries, and other things of that ilk.</p>
<h2 id="gain-more-power">Gain more power!</h2>
<p>Every language has limitations. The lack of straightforward, all-powerful code generation was my primary gripe with C++.</p>
<p>For example, automatically creating function and structure bindings using C++ template metaprogramming is very complex. These are two very useful tools in game development: function bindings for commands, scripting languages, and RPC; structure bindings for serialization or game monitors.</p>
<p>I also wanted features like hot-reloading (being able to load new versions of the code without restarting the program/losing runtime state). Cakelisp made it possible to implement hot-reloading entirely in "user-space", thanks to code modification.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too.">"Have my cake and eat it too."</h2>
<p>By this I mean lose little-to-nothing on metrics I care about, which include build time, runtime performance, overall complexity, and various other things. I looked into several languages in my <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">LanguageTests</a> experiment and found they all had major drawbacks I couldn't accept.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-freedom">Unexpected freedom</h2>
<p>I did not realize when I started Cakelisp how freeing it felt. All of the sudden, I got to decide what made sense to <em>me</em>, not what made sense to previous language designers.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-syntax">Freedom in syntax</h3>
<p>A simple example is type declarations. In C:</p>

<p>The same variable, in Cakelisp:</p>

<p>In my opinion C type declarations are much harder to parse than my explicit type declarations. You need to work backwards from the name to properly interpret the type. The parentheses do add more typing, but they're more clear, machine-parseable, and can be read naturally (e.g. read left to right "pointer to constant character" vs. C's "constant character pointer", which seems worse in my mind).</p>
<p>My form also handles arrays as part of the type: <code>(var my-array ([] 5 int))</code> rather than <code>int myArray[5];</code>, another way it is more consistent, readable, and parsable.</p>
<p>I chose to swap the order of name and type because it places more emphasis on the name. A well-written program will convey more useful information in the name than in the type, so it makes sense to me to have it come first for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-process">Freedom in process</h3>
<p>I also found that having an executable which preprocesses my code exactly how I want it opens the door to a huge amount of awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time code execution. "Macros" and "Generators" are defined in-line with the rest of your code, making them feel like a natural part of your code. Defining them in-line makes it acceptable to add one-off macros, whereas adding such a thing to an external code generator would quickly become unmaintainable</li>
<li>Build optimization. A recent idea I discovered is automatically creating precompiled headers for large batches of 3rd-party headers. This would be a complex task that would need to be integrated in whatever build system you use, whereas Cakelisp can have it built-in</li>
<li>Other data processing. Compile-time code execution means you can do things like prepare assets, download 3rd-party code, run tests, etc. without having to set up all these additional tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I was inspired by Naughty Dog's use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp">Game Oriented Assembly Lisp</a>, GOOL, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c">Racket/Scheme</a> (on their modern titles). I've also taken several ideas from Jonathan Blow's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888">talks on Jai</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer in the game industry. I've been working since July 2015 at a studio that makes cross-platform MMOs. The company has a custom engine written in C (with some C++).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">experimented</a> with other languages before deciding I needed to write my own.</p>

<p>Now that my goals are clear, I will show you how I approached achieving them.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Cakelisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>-style notation. Here is some Cakelisp code from <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame</a>:</p>

<p>There are a few things you can notice from reading this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types. Cakelisp is strongly- and explicitly-typed. I prefer reading code with explicit types because I can better imagine what the computer is actually doing, and what possibilities I have with each variable</li>
<li>Name-type order. I talked about this in a previous section. I wanted to emphasize the name of a variable for conveying meaning, especially when you may have many variables of the same type</li>
<li>Explicit <code>return</code>. I find I prefer code where return points are made explicit. Lisp will implicitly return the result of the last evaluation</li>
<li>Lisp-y style. The parentheses, plus keywords like <code>unless</code>, <code>defun</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>at</code>, and <code>incr</code>. I matched Lisp only when I didn't have strong opinions for a better notation. I am not trying to create something which is compatible with existing Lisps</li>
<li>C types and function calls. Cakelisp has seamless C interop, which means Cakelisp's "standard library" <em>is</em> C's standard library. No bindings had to be written to use the C types or make the function calls</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more Cakelisp code in <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/src">Gamelib</a>.</p>
<p>You should think of Cakelisp more as "C in S-expressions" rather than "Lisp with C performance". If you know C, you'll have a relatively smooth transition to Cakelisp. If you only know Lisp, you're going to have a rougher time.</p>
<h3 id="why-s-expressions">Why S-expressions?</h3>
<p>When I set out to make Cakelisp, I decided on S-expressions syntax for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsability. S-expressions shift the burden of creating a syntax tree onto the programmer. This does result on more work for the human, but I value its extremely explicit nature. It also facilitates simpler tokenization, domain-specific-language implementation, and external tool support</li>
<li>Consistency. There are only four types of tokens in Cakelisp: open and close parenthesis, symbol, and string. The consistency is admittedly limiting, so things like paths (<code>myThing-&gt;member.member</code>) become much more verbose to type, unfortunately. However, this limitation keeps Cakelisp code parsable, and has an elegant feel that I appreciate</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe there is one notation to rule them all, especially after I've encountered the disadvantages of using S-exprs. I'm still happy with the decision though, and it does give Cakelisp a novel and distinguishing characteristic from the many …</p></article></div>

<p>The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is very impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2">CineBench benchmarks</a>.
These scores were 1.6x higher than I got on my old Haswell desktop and 2x
higher than my new Tiger Lake laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">ray tracing API for Metal</a>
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX GPU ray tracing APIs.
So, I decided to pick up a Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive path tracing project,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>,
and to get it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we’ll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
then we’ll make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing
performance comparisons against the M1.</p>

<!--more-->



<p><a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a> is an open source
interactive path tracer that I’ve been working on to learn the different ray tracing APIs,
and to provide an example or starting point for myself and others working with them
in other projects.
ChameleonRT provides backends for the GPU ray tracing APIs:
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/dxr">DirectX Ray Tracing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/vulkan">Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/optix">OptiX 7</a>.
Through the work discussed in this post, it also has a new
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/metal">Metal</a> GPU backend.
ChameleonRT also has an <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/embree">Embree backend</a>
for fast multi-threaded and SIMD accelerated ray tracing on CPUs through
<a href="https://www.embree.org/">Embree</a>, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">TBB</a>.
The rendering code in each backend is nearly identical and they produce almost pixel exact outputs,
with some possible small differences due to subtle differences in the ray tracing
libraries or shader languages.</p>

<p>ChameleonRT is different from popular ray tracing benchmark applications like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">CineBench</a>, <a href="http://www.luxmark.info/">LuxMark</a>,
and <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Benchmark</a>, in that ChameleonRT is
a minimal interactive path tracer. CineBench, LuxMark, and Blender Benchmark are excellent
for getting a full picture of what performance to expect from a production film
renderer, as they are production renderers. However, there’s a lot more going
on in a production renderer than just ray tracing to support the kind of complex
geometries, materials, and effects used in film; and the large code
bases can be challenging to quickly port to a new architecture or API.
ChameleonRT is the exact opposite, supporting just one geometry type,
triangle meshes, and one material type, the Disney BRDF.
The rest of the code is similarly written to achieve interactive path tracing performance,
though I have tried to balance this with how complex the code is to read.
For example, the renderers use iterative ray tracing instead of recursion,
support only a simple sampling strategy, and don’t support alpha cut-out effects.
The use of iterative ray tracing is valuable on both the CPU and GPU, but is
especially important on the GPU, as the
overhead of recursive ray tracing calls in the pipeline can have a significant performance impact.
Similarly, ignoring alpha cut-out effects allows the GPU renderers
to skip using an any hit shader (and the Embree on to skip needing an intersection
filter). The any hit shader (or intersection filter) would be called during
BVH traversal after a candidate intersection with a triangle is found.
In the case that the BVH traversal is hardware accelerated, this ends up
producing a lot amount of back and
forth between the fixed function traversal hardware and the shader cores to run the any hit
shader during traversal, limiting the hardware’s performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a path tracer? Path tracing is a technique in computer graphics for
rendering photo-realistic images by simulating the light transport in
the scene. It is a Monte Carlo technique, meaning that it randomly samples
light paths emitted from lights in the scene that reach the camera
by bouncing off objects in the scene. This is done by tracing the paths in reverse,
starting from the camera and tracing the path back through the scene.
A large number of light paths need to be sampled to produce a noise-free
image. Path tracing is not restricted to photo-realism, and is the
core rendering algorithm used in major film renderers, such as: Pixar’s Renderman,
Disney’s Hyperion, Autodesk’s Arnold, and Weta’s Manuka.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">Wikipedia</a> for more.</p>

<p>The new ray tracing API in Metal will be familiar to those who’ve used inline ray
tracing in DirectX or Vulkan. For a good introduction to Metal’s API, check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">Discover ray tracing
with Metal</a> video from WWDC 2020,
and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal?language=objc">accompanying sample</a>.
Inline ray tracing allows applications to make ray tracing calls in any shader stage,
e.g., fragment/pixel shaders, vertex shaders, compute shaders, etc.
Inline ray tracing allows ray tracing effects, for example accurate reflections and shadows,
to be integrated into the regular rasterization pipeline.
Inline ray tracing can also be used from a compute shader to implement a standalone
path tracing based renderer. ChameleonRT is a standalone path tracer, and takes
the compute shader approach for Metal.</p>

<p>At a high-level, ray tracing in Metal proceeds as follows: you upload your
geometry data, build bottom-level primitive acceleration structures over them, then create instances
referencing those acceleration structures and build a top-level acceleration structure over
the instances.
To render the scene you dispatch a compute shader and trace rays against the top-level
acceleration structure to get back intersection results. The intersection results provide
you with the intersected primitive and geometry IDs, and if using instancing, the instance ID.
Your shader can then look up the geometry data for the object that was hit and shade it,
after which it can continue tracing the path.</p>

<p>At this time Metal only supports inline ray tracing, in contrast to DirectX and Vulkan, which
also provide support for ray tracing pipelines. Ray tracing pipelines are used
to implement standalone ray tracing renderers, and is the approach ChameleonRT
uses in its DirectX and Vulkan backends.
OptiX only supports ray tracing pipelines.
Ray tracing pipelines require the creation of a Shader Binding Table to
provide the API with a table of functions to call when specific objects
in the scene are intersected. The SBT can be difficult to setup and debug,
and is a common point of difficulty for developers learning these APIs.
For more information about the SBT, check out my post
<a href="https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways">“The RTX Shader Binding Table Three Ways”</a>.
However, the potential benefit of the SBT is that the GPU can reorder or group function
calls to reduce thread divergence. With inline ray tracing, the developer
must do this themselves, or do without
(check out another video from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10013/">WWDC20</a>
for information here).
Right now, ChameleonRT does not do any reordering to reduce divergence.</p>

<p>Those familiar with Metal may know of the previous
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing?language=objc">Metal Performance Shaders ray intersector</a>.
The new support for inline ray tracing improves on this by allowing the renderer
to move entirely to the GPU. The previous ray intersector worked by taking
batches of rays, finding intersections in the scene, and writing these results
back out to memory. Multiple compute shaders would need to be dispatched to
trace the primary rays and create shadow and secondary rays, then trace the shadow rays
and continue the secondary rays while filtering out paths that terminated.
This requires significantly more memory traffic and compute dispatches, introducing overhead
to the renderer. Such an approach is also not well suited to augmenting traditional
rasterization pipelines with ray tracing effects.
Approaches based on tracing and sorting rays and intersection information to extract
coherence are valuable for complex film renderers, and can be implemented efficiently using inline
ray tracing as well.
For example, <a href="https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/hyperiondesign.html">Disney’s Hyperion renderer</a>
uses sorting and batching extensively to
extract coherent workloads from an otherwise incoherent and divergent distribution of rays.
There’s also an excellent higher-level <a href="https://youtu.be/frLwRLS_ZR0">video</a> explaining how this
works.</p>

<p>The Metal ray tracing API is quite nice to work with.
It bears a lot of similarity to the other ray tracing APIs, but has been streamlined
to be easier to use.
For example, compare the code required to build and compact a BVH in
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/dxr/dxr_utils.cpp#L877-L977">DirectX</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/vulkan/vulkanrt_utils.cpp#L46-L214">Vulkan</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/metal/metalrt_utils.mm#L318-L396">Metal</a>.
OptiX’s API provides a similar simplification, here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/optix/optix_utils.cpp#L183-L244">BVH build in OptiX</a>
for reference.
It’s also nice to have templates and C++ style functionality in the shader language,
a feature Metal shares with OptiX, which uses CUDA for the device side code.</p>

<p>This simplicity also has some drawbacks. For example, while in DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
you have control over where the acceleration structure memory is allocated,
Metal makes this allocation for you. As a result, you cannot allocate the acceleration
structures on a <code>MTLHeap</code>, and so to make sure they’re available for your rendering
pipeline, you must individually mark them as used in a loop instead of a single <code>useHeap</code> call.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span></span><span>// Use our top level acceleration structure</span>
<span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>setAccelerationStructure</span><span>:</span><span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>atBufferIndex</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>// Also mark all mesh acceleration structures used, as they're indirectly</span>
<span>// referenced by the top level one</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mesh</span> <span>:</span> <span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>meshes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>useResource</span><span>:</span><span>mesh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>usage</span><span>:</span><span>MTLResourceUsageRead</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This can add some overhead if you have a lot of bottom level BVHs, as can be the
case in scenes with many instances.
It’d be nice to be able to allocate the acceleration structures on a heap, and replace this loop
with a single <code>[command_encoder useHeap:data_heap-&gt;heap];</code></p>

<p>The API is also simplified significantly by not including ray tracing pipelines and
only requiring a Shader Binding Table-esque
structure when implementing custom geometries or other operations that need
to happen …</p></div></div></div>

For a local installation, supply instead of "pil" the actual path like "./pil"
or "../pil21/pil".

The pieces are indicated by the letters 'K'ing, 'Q'ueen, 'R'ook, 'B'ishop,
k'N'ight and 'P'awn, with black pieces in angular brackets.

You can enter your moves with the field names (in lower case) for the "from" and
"to" positions:

: (go e2 e4)

Castling may be entered by just specifying the king's move:

: (go e1 g1)

To promote a pawn to some piece other than a queen, you can specify a class:

: (go h7 h8 +Knight)

To undo one or several moves, enter

: (go -)

and to redo them

: (go +)

To switch sides (and have the computer play against itself), call 'go' without
arguments:

: (go)

The initial board position can be restored with

: (main)

The global variable '*Depth' holds the maximal depth of the alpha-beta tree
search. It defaults to 5. You may change it to some smaller value for a faster
response, or to a larger value for a deeper search:

: (setq *Depth 7)

The same effect can be achieved by passing the desired depth as the first
argument to 'main':

: (main 7)

The second (optional) argument to 'main' is your color ('NIL' for white and 'T'
for black).

To setup some given board position, call 'main' with a list of triples, with
each describing:

   1. The field
   2. The piece's classes
   3. An optional flag to indicate that the piece did not move yet

: (main 5 NIL

At any time, you can print the current board position in the above format to a
file with

: (ppos "file")

which later can be restored with

: (load "file")


   === PilBox and Web App ===

If you have the PilBox App installed on your Android device, just type "chess"
in the settings and press the "Download" button.

To start the Web application, use

   $ pil chess/main.l -chess~main -go +

Alternatively, you can start it with German localization as

   $ pil chess/main.l -'chess~main "DE" "de"' -go +

then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

In both cases you can interact with the chess board in this way:

   â€” To enter a move, drag a piece to the new field.
   â€” A click on the board does an auto-move and then switches sides.
   â€” The search depth can be changed with a drop-down menu.
   â€” The "New" button starts a new game, and the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons
     navigate in the history.
   â€” The text "White" or "Black" indicate who is to move next. It changes to
     "White ..." or "Black ..." while the computer is thinking.
   â€” After a move, the moved piece and the old and new positions are indicated
     above that text.
   â€” "Save" and "Load" allow a single (!) save/restore of a game position.

The "Setup" button switches to edit mode and allows you to change the position
manually:

   â€” A click on a piece removes it from the board.
   â€” Dragging a piece moves it to another field.
   â€” A new piece can be placed on the board by dragging it from the setup area.
   â€” The "Clear" button removes all pieces from the board.
   â€” The "New" button sets up all pieces for a new game.
   â€” The "Game" button switches back to play mode.

As in any PilBox app, you can go to the settings (wheel icon on top right) and

   â€” switch to another language in the "Language" tab or
   â€” view the App's source code by clicking on the app name "chess" in the
     "PILs" tab.

                            <p>In May 2020, Riverlane revealed that they will lead a consortium which has been <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/05/uk-companies-to-build-radically-new-operating-system-for-quantum-computers/">awarded a £7.6m grant to build a radically new operating system</a> for quantum computers. We marked a ‘hello world’ moment in September, with the first <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/09/commercial-breakthrough-following-success-of-deltaflow-os-trials/">successful trials of Deltaflow.OS</a>, using quantum hardware belonging to leading trapped-ion company, <a href="https://www.oxionics.com/">Oxford Ionics</a>.</p>
<p>The latest milestone is the public release of the first version of Deltaflow.OS; ‘Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ’. The product has been built to enable quantum hardware companies as well as algorithm and app developers to accelerate their research by making collaboration easier and reduce down-time in labs. This version uses simulated hardware and <a href="http://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/">ARTIQ</a> as a backend. ARTIQ is a control system which is widely used in the trapped-ion community.</p>
<p>Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ consists of the Deltaflow language (Deltalanguage), and various hardware models on which the language can be run, including an emulator of the ARTIQ control system. The Deltalanguage lets users define a graph of different hardware nodes corresponding to the type of hardware elements found in labs. After defining a programme, users can test it on increasingly realistic hardware models.</p>
<p>Robert Jördens of M-Labs commented, “My hands are twitching because I really want to see and try that&nbsp;emulator and Deltaflow. There are so many valuable pieces in there.”</p>
<p>A first <a href="https://vimeo.com/480247763/d8fd4a0708">public demonstration of Deltaflow.OS</a> took place at the virtual National Quantum Technologies Showcase on 6 November 2020, where the team demonstrated how a Rabi-Oscillation would be performed.</p>
<p>The release of Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ marks a significant step towards Riverlane’s mission to build a quantum operating system that is high performance, portable across all qubit technologies and scalable to millions of qubits.</p>
