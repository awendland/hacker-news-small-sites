<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>I feel like I should start off this blog post by mentioning that I am a Product Designer with little to no development skills, so I heavily rely on no-code tools to get my side projects up and running.</code></p>
<p>The idea of creating something that thousands of users could potentially use was just so exciting to me. Over the course of just shy of a year, I worked on 2 projects that made me less than $20, <strong>combined</strong>, so I feel like it's safe to say I can share my experience with you guys and hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p> <img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604131920818/D9DxXPfJk.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Custom Size – 3.png"></p>
<p>Oof, designtarget was a wild ride. On 18-8-2019, god knows what happened but I just hopped on Namecheap and purchased the domain <a href="http://designtarget.org/" target="_blank">designtarget.org</a> with no prior experience in web development. I was just so into the idea of creating the 'ultimate design directory' that I really didn't think anything through. How would I monetize the platform? Do I even have a list of resources that I can work with? Where will I market the website? So many questions, and little to no answers.</p>
<p>I remembered seeing an ad for a visual editor plugin on Wordpress called Elementor, it seemed intuitive so I go to Namecheap's cPanel and install Wordpress, purchase a year's subscription to Elementor and I get building. Literally next day I was done, I didn't think the design through, I just wanted to get an MVP out right away, and this atrociousness was born, but I was proud of it. I had no web development knowledge and I made a website, and it felt great.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132243316/TKr68CyWaA.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Web 1920 – 1.png"></p>
<p>Naturally, I wanted people to see what I had built, so I go on Reddit and post the website on /r/webdev - no it wasn't a Saturday(you can only post your work on Feedback Saturday on /r/webdev), yes the post was locked. But that doesn't matter, why you ask?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132936013/UONs_j1_Z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p>8.5k visitors in less than 2 hours of being on reddit when I wasn't supposed to. I knew I was onto something, but a little after the hype died down, it dawned on me, I just missed a huge chance to build an audience. I rushed creating the website that I missed some essentials such as <strong>creating a newsletter sign up</strong> or even just a <strong>blog</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few months, I eventually create a newsletter, Instagram page, and even a blog. </p>
<p>📧 ~300 newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>📸 ~400 Instagram followers.</p>
<p>and most importantly, my blogs were ranking on Google. I don't have Search Console screenshots but I had ranked around ~11th or so for a few articles. </p>
<p>I had solved the traffic problem of any side project, but monetization was where this project went downhill. I simply had no monetization plan whatsoever. And this is where the story of designtarget, ends, well, I sold off the project for a measly amount but that was it.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 No matter how excited you are, keep cool and think things through.</p>
<p>👉 Traffic is easy, business is hard. </p>
<p>👉 Think things through, but also do not spend much time working on an MVP.</p>
<p>👉 It is fine to not know what you're doing.</p>

<p>This one is close to my heart, it really is. You can read my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">post on IndieHackers</a> to know why I stopped working on Good Code.</p>
<p>The idea originally came to me when I discovered  <a target="_blank" href="http://frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a>, by then I had learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and wanted to improve my skills. I liked FEM, but the free templates were just not the level of design I wanted to work on, queue Good Code.</p>
<p>This time, I was ready, monetization plan was straight-forward, content was ready, community building was in place, newsletter was in place. I cook up a static version of the website using HTML and CSS and release it on Github Pages, you can view Good Code  <a target="_blank" href="https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode">here</a> and straight to reddit I go (and IndieHackers this time as well). </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604134249747/BPvkUcJ5j.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 2.png"></p>
<p>September 3rd, to September 15th. I was onto something, again. Shortly after launching, I view my Gumroad page only to find 2 customers have purchased templates for a total of $10. My first internet money! </p>
<p>I also had people posting their solutions on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCodeChallenge/">subreddit</a>  I created just for this website, it felt great.</p>
<p>I really wanted to continue working on Good Code, as it stands, it's only hosted on GH Pages, so there's a good chance there <em>could</em> have been more sales had it been on an actual domain. I might resume working on Good Code in a future date, but for now, I'm pausing for reasons listed in the  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">IndieHackers post</a>. </p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 Spin ideas. I could have just released this as just another website selling Adobe XD templates, but I feel like the 'improve your HTML and CSS skills' twist was what brought this to life.</p>
<p>👉 Create a community for your side-project.</p>
<p> 👉 Don't be afraid to shut down.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, had I not started designtarget, I wouldn't have learned how to code (albeit being bad at it), had I not learned how to code, I wouldn't have started Good Code and made my first $ from a side-projects, who knows what my next had I not started is going to be, but I feel like it might be success.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

                        <p>A pilot project using sniffer dogs to provide instant and pain-free coronavirus testing at Helsinki airport has shown promising early results and proven popular with travellers, researchers said on Wednesday.</p><p>Three dogs, named Kossi, ET and Miina, have sniffed swabs taken from 2,200 passengers in the month since the testing booth was set up at the airport's arrivals hall, and have found the virus in 0.6 percent of travellers.</p><p>Although the research is not due for completion until December, the team say the initial findings appear broadly in line with detection rates of the nasal PCR tests also conducted on arriving travellers.</p><p>"We have done 16-17,000 PCR tests at the airport and less than one percent are positive," Timo Aronkyto, deputy mayor of Vantaa, told reporters.</p><p>Compared to the results found by the dogs, "they are about the same, I don't think there is a statistical difference," Aronkyto said.</p><p>The researchers are now analysing how closely the two sets of test results match each other -- whether the dogs found coronavirus in passengers whose infection was confirmed by a PCR test -- and hope to publicise their findings at the end of the year.</p><p>Preliminary experiments in the first major wave of infections earlier in the year suggested the dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy, up to five days earlier than a PCR test.</p><p>Feedback from arriving passengers, who take the free-of-charge test voluntarily, "has been exceptionally positive," project manager Soile Turunen said. </p><p>Around 100 travellers a day have been queuing up for the test, which involves wiping a swab onto the skin which is then put in front of the dog, who will quickly pass over a negative sample but will be attracted to a positive one.</p><p>"People don't complain about the queues, in fact it's the opposite," Turunen said. </p><p>"They're coming up to us to to say 'Hi' from morning until evening," she added.</p><p>A fourth dog, a German shepherd called Valo, is currently in training to begin work at the airport testing booth.</p><p>The Helsinki University researchers behind the trial, working with sniffer-dog specialists from the organisation Wise Nose, hope that their research will persuade the government to fund a rollout of the dogs for other uses, such as at tourist hotspots or large public gatherings.</p><p>Although sniffer dog trials have been undertaken elsewhere, such as in the UAE, France, Ruussia and Chile, use of canine scent-detectors to bolster coronavirus testing has not yet been widely adopted by authorities, in part because of a lack of peer-reviewed literature, some researchers believe.</p><p>Dog handling charities have previously worked with dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson's disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from humans.</p>

<p><b>LIL</b> (stands for <b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage)
is a small highly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and
unix shells. LIL has two implementations, one written in <b>C</b>,
which consists of a pair of <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt> files
and one in <b><a href="http://freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a></b>,
which consists of a single <tt>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a
<a href="http://lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a> package for the
latter is provided.</p>

<p>LIL is currently available as source code snapshots of both
the C and the Free Pascal version combined in a single ZIP file.
These snapshots are versioned using their release date. Note that
the interpreter's reflect version command will report <i>0.1</i>
regardless of date versioning. Both of these will change at some
point in the future to provide proper versioned releases.</p>

<h3><a name="latestversion"></a>Latest version</h3>

<p>The latest version of LIL is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lil20190821.zip">lil20190821.zip</a>
(159KB). This is an extract from my private Fossil repository
(the files are mostly the same as the older archives, but this
also includes a full changelog from the repository going back
to 2010 and the LIL logo as an XCF image which can be opened with
GIMP).</p>

<p>Please note that <b>20190821</b> contains slightly altered
behavior for line breaking during list parsing that <i>could</i>
affect some scripts, especially with lists that contain code inside
square brackets, however the previous behavior was completely
broken (e.g. having multiple commands inside brackets in a list
would merge all commands into a single one and if a semicolon
was used for the multiple commands, the entire command wouldn't
be parsed properly). Because of that i expect any reliance on
the previous behavior to be accidental (and in practice i do not
really expect any such script to even exist). Also in the same
version a Bash script is introduced to check the differences between
different executables by running the same scripts under both and
comparing the results, which show that FPLIL contains a few incompatibilities
with C LIL. At this moment FPLIL doesn't implement the changes
mentioned so far - all these incompatibilities and changes will
be fixed in a later release.</p>

<h3><a name="olderversions"></a>Older versions</h3>

<p>Some older versions are also available in case you need them.
LIL should be mostly backwards compatible (see below), but right
now there is no promise for strict API or ABI compatibility.</p>

<h3><a name="lilgui"></a>LILGUI</h3>

<p><b>LILGUI</b> is an experimental API specification for GUI
applications that provide scripting functionality through LIL
to expose a simple GUI API. It is mainly intended for creating
embeddable GUIs (e.g. a panel in a sidebar) although it can also
be used for popup windows and dialogs. Currently the only implementation
for LILGUI is <b>LazLILGUI</b>, which is a component for Lazarus
that uses LCL to provide the actual GUI functionality.</p>

<p>The latest version of LILGUI files (which include the API spec,
LazLILGUI and a couple of examples) can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lilgui20190708215135.zip">downloaded
here</a> (85KB). A 64bit windows binary for <b>LazLILGUI Notepad</b>,
a text editor that provides a sidebar to try out LILGUI code,
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepad20190708.zip">downloaded here</a> (1.3MB).
Also you can see the screenshots of program in action under <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadwin.png">Windows</a>, <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadlin.png">Linux</a>
and <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadosx.png">Mac OS X</a> and also the <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgcce.png">Custom Control Example</a> under Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>API stability and compatibility</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, both the C and Free Pascal implementation
APIs are stable <i>for the most part</i>. The <b>C API</b> was
broken only once in middle 2010 when <code>lil_command_t</code>
was renamed to <code>lil_func_t</code> and the <b>C ABI</b> for
the Windows DLL is also backwards compatible since late 2010.
The <b>Free Pascal</b> implementation has a less stable API but
as Free Pascal itself does not support ABI stability, this is
less of a concern.</p>

<p>In the foreseeable future the C API should be stable, but i'd
recommend <i>against</i> building a system-wide shared version
of the library before a proper versioned release is made. Once
a versioned release is made, both the API and ABI will remain
stable for as long as it is technically possible.</p>

<p>Script code should be backwards compatible even as new commands
are introduced since scripts and host applications will redefine
any conflicting functions anyway. The only time script code was
broken was in 2012 when the multiline comments were introduced
so any script that used a comment line like <code>#####</code>
was broken. This was addressed in a fix in 2014 that added a special
check for such cases so that multiline comments can only start
and end with two <code>#</code>s but not three or more (while
this could have broken any script that used three or more <code>#</code>s
to start and end multiline comments, the chances for such a script
are very slim).</p>

<p>Like with the C API, the script backwards compatibility currently
is mostly stable, but minor changes (like the multiline comment
changes mentioned above) might be made until a versioned release
is made or fixes to the script behavior to be closer to what is
described in the documentation or simply fix broken behavior.
At that point no changes will be made that may affect backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>LILGUI and LazLILGUI are more experimental and may see backwards
incompatible changes in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Currently the only documentation is the (lengthy) <tt>readme.txt</tt>
file that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/readme.txt">you can read here</a> or as part
of the archive containing the source code. At some point i'll
write better formatted documentation. Free Pascal has its own
API documentation <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/pasreadme.txt">readable here</a> and
also as a part of the archive containing the source code.</p>

<p>The LILGUI API can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/api.txt">found here</a> and
the documentation for LazLILGUI can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgreadme.txt">found
here</a>. Both are also part of the LILGUI archive.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/badsectoracula/lil-presentation">an
old LIL presentation can be found on SlideShare</a>. Please note
that the URLs in the presentation are not valid anymore.</p>

<h2><a name="status"></a>Status</h2>

<p>LIL is practically <i>feature-complete</i> and i do very little
development of it. I do not plan on making it a big and bloated
library that tries to provide everything - if anything, in the
future i might add some conditionals to remove bits of the library
for users who do not need, e.g, the string or list functions.</p>

<p>Further work is mostly "around" LIL and not on the
language itself: improving the documentation, writing a test suite
(currently there are several examples which i run after making
changes and almost half of them come from bug fixes, but i'd like
somethnig more automated), fixing some issues with the Free Pascal
implementation, adding more functions on the C API to access LIL's
state, etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About every year or so I decide to change note-taking apps. Or at least I change <em>most</em> of my notes to a new app. This time I'm going back to an old app, but because of a "new" note-taking paradigm. The one I'm going back to is <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>, but with a twist. In this post, I hope to look at some of the new ideas in note-taking and some of the apps available.</p><p>The new paradigm that I'm talking about is backlinking. It's actually not a new idea at all of course, but there have been many apps that have started to take advantage of backlinking. The one that launched off the fad was <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. Many of these tools are based on or enable, a note-taking method called Zettelkasten.</p><p>Zettelkasten is a technique of note taking and indexing popularized by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist from the middle of the 20th century. Zettelkasten, literally "slip box", was a note-taking method in which small slips of paper were ID'd and linked to one another, creating a linked system of knowledge that Luhmann could then use in his books, research, and papers. As the links were maintained in two directions, ideas could be backward linked to other ideas. Ideas from various sources could then form a new network and hopefully, new links could be formed between information. There's more to it, such as the idea that each note should be an atomic, well-formed idea. For more information, and because I'm failing to explain it, visit <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">https://zettelkasten.de/</a>.</p><p>I won't pretend to be an expert in Zettelkasten, and all of this is new to me. Frankly, I'm not even sure that the Zettelkasten method would be useful to me as I need longer form notes on many of the things that I do. But the idea of backlinking notes so that you can refer to notes that refer to the note that you're on seems extremely powerful. It feels like the next innovation in note-taking, beyond simple outlining or linking, precisely because you're essentially forming a distributed network of notes.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2><p>Let me give you an example. Say that I'm working on Kubernetes and can't remember the name of a tool that I had used. I can just pull up the Kubernetes note and look at the backlinks and see which notes are tagged as Kubernetes. Why couldn't I just create a link on the Kubernetes note? Well, of course, I could, but that would require opening that note and adding a link that may have nothing to do with the context for the primary Kubernetes notes.</p><p>Or another example, I am taking notes on a sermon being preached on John 3. I can then dive into John 3's note and look at all other sources tagged with John 3, including sermon notes, book notes, or personal devotional notes. From there I could dive into individual topics such as love or the kingdom of God.</p><p>At least, that's how I hope it will work in practice. Again, I'm just getting started</p><p>It seems that with the release of Roam Research, there have now been a plethora of tools in development that work off of the idea of backlinks, as well as atomic thoughts. I've done a lot of research in the last week, and have formed some opinions about some. Let's start first with the note-taking app I'm coming from:</p><h2>Notion</h2><p><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> seemed to take off in 2018-2019 as the premiere note-taking app. Indeed, Notion has introduced backlinks in a recent release.</p><p>I like Notion, and will both keep paying for it and taking notes there. It has a lot of power in organizing and reorganizing notes, as well as pulling in other content such as code, videos, images, etc. It even goes so far as to include database-like tables and Kanban-style boards.</p><p>Backlinks in Notion seem to primarily work at the "page" level, rather than the block//heading level like Roam Research. And while I love Notion as a clean interface for notes, I'm not wild about its lack of capabilities in making TODOs and alerts and finding notes after the fact. Its search is great but basic.</p><h2>Roam Research</h2><p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> seems like a really powerful system, particularly for a research-style Zettelkasten. I honestly have not tried it, both because I didn't get into the trial, but now because of the cost and the concern of people losing notes and the lack of good backups. Most of the posts I've seen about note stability have disappeared, but you can see one graveyard here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/">https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/</a>. There was even a post today about it: <a href="https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/">https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/</a></p><p>Frankly, I prefer open source and being in control of my own content and notes. I know Notion doesn't fit into that well, but it also seemed ahead of its time to me.</p><h2>TiddlyWiki</h2><p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> has been around a while and was the note system I used before Notion. TiddlyWiki is many things, but at its heart, it was a single file HTML that you could download and make changes to in wiki syntax. TiddlyWiki has had backlinks for a while, possibly even before Roam Research, but recently the community has released some versions specifically for backlinking: <a href="https://akhater.github.io/drift/">Drift</a> and <a href="https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch/">Tiddly Research</a> are two that I've tried out.</p><p>They're great, but there are a few problems that I've had with TiddlyWiki that just make me hesitant. I had a lot of notes in it as I was working in Seminary, wrote a custom Bible linking plugin, etc, but updating it was a nightmare on the node version with my customization. For each upgrade, I'd have to manually diff my plugin changes against the upgrades. Of course, this may have just been me not knowing what I was doing, but it still wasn't fun. Also, just the speed of entering notes and using the mouse doesn't appeal to me. Being a Vim guy, I like my keyboard.</p><h2>Obsidian</h2><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a recent and gorgeous option for note-taking. It was actually my first introduction to backlinking and this whole area of decentralized notes. It's a commercial-style app (more on that below), but also works off of just a directory of markdown files. So you get to keep your content regardless. It feels great to use, I like its editor (not as well as <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> or Notion though), and it's fast, responsive, and the keyboard shortcuts are great. It even has a basic Vim mode.</p><p>My only hangups are: if you use it for commercial purposes, the license becomes a pay-as-you-go SAAS license. The free license is just for personal use. Also, it's not open source, so there's always the risk that the company could go under and disappear, or worse, that they start charging way after I'm invested in it. Sure, they're just markdown files...I could make my own note-taking app if that were the case...but I don't have that much time or interest. Also, the backlinks seem to just be at the note level, but I didn't mind that as much in this app.</p><p>Still, if you're looking for a personal note-taking app that's easy to get into, supports backlinks, has the graph, uses markdown, is modern-looking, and is nice to use, totally give Obsidian a try.</p><h2>Joplin</h2><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a> is one that I've just tried a little bit. It looks fine as far as an editor, has nice backlinking, etc. The one hangup that made me put it down quickly is that links are always based on note ID, so you have to find a note to get its ID and insert it. It didn't seem nearly as fast or practical as I wanted. It is open source though, and worth a look.</p><h2>Trilium</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium">Trilium</a> is an app I see recommended often. It's also free and open source. It claims to have automatic markdown conversion, but I couldn't get it to work. I gave up pretty soon after that.</p><h2>Zim</h2><p><a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a> is a desktop wiki that I've used quite a lot in the past. It also has a backlinks plugin. It works great, is open source as well, and is very quick for taking notes. The negatives for this one are that it looks old and that it uses a custom wiki syntax that I don't like as well as markdown or Org.</p><h2>MindForger</h2><p><a href="https://www.mindforger.com/">MindForger</a> kind of does its own thing. It's difficult to explain, but worth checking out. It kind of has backlinks in that it has notes that are related to each other, but in more of an AI/intuitive way than in a manual way. It takes the headlines of Markdown files and makes them notes, but for each note lets you embed other top headlines/etc. It's weird but worth checking out. For a great intro, watch the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I</a>.</p><p>MindForger is open source and seems really powerful. I'm going to keep playing with it. The only negative is that it's got the whole split-screen preview/markdown editor like many of the others on this list, but there's no graphical component to the editor at all. The keyboard shortcuts are multi-key and not configurable as well, but they're intuitive.</p><h2>Foam</h2><p><a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> is a plugin to Visual Studio code that emulates many features from Roam/Obsidian. It has backlinks, a graph, and looks decent.</p><p>Honestly, though, I don't like Visual Studio code, it's not the greatest editing experience, and the backlinks seem majorly delayed from saving. But maybe that was just my experience. This is one that has a lot of promise and I would keep my eye on in the future, but seems it has a little ways to go.</p><p>I'll give an honorable mention to <a href="https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron">Dendron</a>, which seems to be at least on par with Foam. It also has a hierarchical system but seems to keep all of the files in the same directory using a dot-separated notation. Also worth checking out and watching, but also had delayed backlink processing and note a great markdown editing experience.</p><h2>Org-roam</h2><p><a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a> is where I landed for now. Org-roam is an extension of the famous <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> for Emacs. I used Org Mode a LOT when I was new to Emacs. It's really crazy how deep the rabbit hole goes for Org Mode. Org Mode is best described as an outliner, journal, day planner, calendar, TODO list, kanban board, interactive coding tool, TODO capture tool (including linking to source code lines, a browser, or even against a pdf as you're reading it), and presentation software. I'm sure there are a dozen or two things I'm missing too.</p><p>I'll caveat this though...you have to be a little crazy to use org-mode. Configuring it alone can be a trial in insanity, but once you master …</p></div></div>

But what does it take to secure one of these highly sought-after positions? Like any job in technology, machine learning positions require candidates to go through a rigorous series of technical interviews. </p><p id="viewer-43gc5">What is the structure of these interviews? What topics are covered? Are these interviews similar to software engineering? (Spoiler: sorta, kinda) Who is paying for lunch? </p><p id="viewer-781mt">There are a lot of questions, but not a lot of answers out there. This is largely because the field of machine learning is still young and learning to stand on its own two feet. </p><p id="viewer-cemkd">This article is intended to be the missing guide for what to expect in a machine learning interview. The observations in this post are born out of collective experiences interviewing for machine learning engineer and scientist positions, comprising over 90 hours of interview time across 80+ interviews at big (FAANG) companies, small (just out of Y-Combinator) companies, and everything in-between.</p><p id="viewer-522i9">Let's get started.</p><h3 id="viewer-32gml"><strong>Machine learning interviews are diverse...sometimes</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ecirs">The machine learning landscape is constantly evolving. If you were entering the world of machine learning ~4 years ago, the most in-demand skill would be the ability to build and debug deep learning models. Today with the rise of tools like PyTorch and Tensorflow, a bigger issue is not so much how to build machine learning prototypes but rather how to take them all the way to a deployed system in production (also called the last-mile problem). </p><p id="viewer-63ac7">What this means is that over the course of several years of interviewing for these positions, we've learned that the nature of these assessments can be incredibly diverse. For example, the following are examples of real interview types/questions that we've had:</p><p id="viewer-ac86k">	1) Read a recent paper on unsupervised learning for noise reduction and whiteboard extensions to the techniques proposed in the paper</p><p id="viewer-aj8c3">	2) Explain the nodes in the Tensorflow computational graph for a feedforward layer of a neural network</p><p id="viewer-5lue8">	3) Give an hour-long talk about some machine learning project you have done and get grilled on its details</p><p id="viewer-4bjvl">	4)  Describe how you would implement Google's autocomplete </p><p id="viewer-2p8og">	5) Explain why L1 regularization encourages sparsity in features</p><p id="viewer-5hjhh">Sound like these questions are all over the place? Don't get overwhelmed: they are.</p><p id="viewer-53d1i">Does that mean you will have to know how to do all of the above for your interview? No, definitely not. This variety is only meant to illustrate that many things are fair game depending on the company you are applying to and what they expect your responsibilities will be. </p><p id="viewer-3hihv">For example, if you are applying to a more research-intensive machine learning position, you may be asked to explain research-caliber work (either yours or that of others). Or if you are going to be a machine learning engineer at a young company, you may have to be more familiar with the internals of a framework or technology stack that is in high-demand. It really depends.</p><p id="viewer-7annu">That being said, as the field has matured, we've seen that the responsibilities of these positions are getting more well-defined leading to more standardized assessment structures.</p><p id="viewer-ciu37">Nowadays for most machine learning engineer positions, you can expect your interview journey to look something like the following:</p><ul><li id="viewer-6irq6"><p>First screening call with a recruiter</p></li><li id="viewer-edt1j"><p>Technical phone interview covering some software engineering and machine learning theory</p></li><li id="viewer-e1103"><p>Onsite (~4-5 interviews)</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-esrfv">                - Software engineering principles (~2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-62fec">                - Machine learning theory (~1 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-2ugbd">                - Machine learning system design (~1-2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-es0je">                - Interview with management (cultural fit check, typical in startups)</p><p id="viewer-73jhi">This can be subject to change depending on the company, but we've largely seen that common format across interviews today. Now let's discuss what to expect in terms of specific skills being evaluated.</p><h3 id="viewer-avlia"><strong>Know your machine learning theory</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dob3m">When applying for machine learning jobs you will always be asked about machine learning theory. In a sense, this a "well duh" moment but the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>machine learning</u></a> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>theory</u></a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>literature</u></a> is vast so knowing what to focus on rather than working through multiple 1000-page textbooks is the key question.</p><p id="viewer-et0di"> Conceptual questions are asked in one of two forms: 1) in the context of some larger problem (i.e. while describing a system design, discuss model tradeoffs) or 2) in isolation (i.e. spend 30+ minutes describing how your favorite supervised learning algorithm works).</p><p id="viewer-t28k">In either case, the types of questions and concepts you'll be asked about stay pretty consistent. Our survey of past machine learning interviews has shown that you will tend to be tested on topics such as the following:</p><p id="viewer-5srhm">	1) What is the bias-variance tradeoff?</p><p id="viewer-fo0au">	2) What is overfitting/underfitting and how do you know when your model is suffering from those issues?</p><p id="viewer-bg784">	3) How do you evaluate model performance (which metrics are used and why)?</p><p id="viewer-b17gt">	4) Can you explain how some classical machine learning models work (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, etc.)?</p><p id="viewer-2o3la">	5) What are common techniques for unsupervised learning?</p><p id="viewer-3sb7r">	6) How do you pick the best features for your model?</p><p id="viewer-b7b5m">That being said, because the collection of potential theory topics is so large, we've distilled the key concepts seen in interviews into a <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/assets/ml-primer/ml_primer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>primer with practice exercises</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-537k4"><strong>Software engineering is still important</strong></h3><p id="viewer-8v5gq">While the focus of machine learning jobs isn't just software engineering, you should still expect to be asked some more traditional coding and algorithms questions. These questions will be very similar, if not identical, to those you would be asked in a standard engineering interview. </p><p id="viewer-27v4b">Although this may seem unrelated to what you would think a machine learning practitioner does, when you are on the job knowing <em>how</em> to theoretically build a model is not the same as doing the actual building. This is true whether or not you are applying to be a machine learning scientist or a machine learning engineer. You need to be proficient in coding, debugging, and thinking through algorithms exercises. As an example of topics you can expect to be asked about:</p><p id="viewer-eal72">	1) Recursion and memoization (you'll basically never use recursion in the real world but 		   it's often used to evaluate your ability to think through an algorithm)</p><p id="viewer-cmind">	2) Memory and run-time complexity analysis</p><p id="viewer-d4m4q">	3) Standard data structures like trees, linked lists, hash maps, and general graphs</p><p id="viewer-9rse9">That being said, the standards for coding may not be the same in your interviews as they would be of someone applying for a pure software development position. In other words your engineering abilities might not need to be as sophisticated, especially if you are just coming out of an advanced graduate degree program in machine learning where your focus was more on pushing state-of-the-art rather than building robust training pipelines. </p><p id="viewer-dkeon">For software engineering, there are a number of popular <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>books</u></a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>services</u></a> that can help you practice these skills.</p><h3 id="viewer-76m1h"><strong>Know how to build machine learning systems</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ba220">Knowing how to architect machine learning systems is one of the most important skills you can have going into the field of machine learning. One of the big aspects of machine learning's evolution in the past 1-2 years is that companies are going all-in on integrating data-driven solutions to extract business value across their teams. At scale this can lead to <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/accepted-papers/view/150-successful-machine-learning-models-6-lessons-learned-at-booking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>tremendous improvements</u></a> in the quality of a service. </p><p id="viewer-2j318">When you are being brought into a team as a machine learning expert, the expectation is that you will be able to apply machine learning skills to improve some existing manual process. Oftentimes you will be presented with very vague problem descriptions (e.g. "I want these recommendations to be better") and you will have to break down and frame the problem in a form where machine learning is applicable.</p><p id="viewer-bj4et">This is the core of designing and architecting machine learning systems. This skill is among the most crucial ones that companies look for when evaluating candidates. A system design interview will involve being presented with a case study (e.g. "we want a tool that can help us detect offensive content on our platform") and then talking through how to set up a machine learning pipeline that can address the problem. Along the way you will be assessed on your ability to:</p><p id="viewer-b3dv8">	1) Gather and validate datasets needed for your models</p><p id="viewer-3ctv5">	2) Build training infrastructure</p><p id="viewer-actbm">	3) Discuss the tradeoffs among potential modelling solutions</p><p id="viewer-7bofr">	4) Know what metrics you will track for model performance</p><p id="viewer-5tid6">	5) Interpret model predictions and do error analysis</p><p id="viewer-b2nej">	6) Architect a deployment solution (e.g. cloud-based, on-device, etc.)</p><p id="viewer-3hr9b">	7) Iterate on user feedback to improve the solution</p><p id="viewer-2fn8e">The important thing to recognize in these types of interviews is that there is never one "correct" answer. Your interviewers are more interested in knowing how you think through a problem. You will be asked to justify your decisions and also adapt them based on new situations (e.g. "now imagine we don't have enough money to gather 1 million annotated images...").</p><p id="viewer-2plnr">When preparing for these types of interviews, there's no substitute for real-world experience. Build projects so you witness firsthand what tradeoffs are necessary to consider. If that's not possible, spend a lot of time reading through company use-cases and learning how others have <a href="https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>solved similar problems</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-44oq9"><strong>Technical interviews are just one signal</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dmrea">The last point worth mentioning is that while technical interviews are important signals in determining whether you get the job, they are still only one of many contributing signals. In particular, many startups also place great emphasis on your cultural fit …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

      <main id="main">
        
        <div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <div>
                

                <div>
                  <p>When we started Reify, the idea was pretty simple – let’s take the experience we’ve gained as marketers at developer facing companies, and apply that knowledge to as many software companies as we can. Let’s raise the tide for everyone, and help everyone become better marketers. After more than 4 years and 75 clients, we’re extremely happy with the results, and it felt like the right time to take a step back, consider what we’ve accomplished and learned (and, glaringly, what mistakes we made), and try to do what every great marketer and consultant loves to do: define a framework.</p>

<p>Our first few clients, bless their souls, were very patient with us as we slowly but surely codified our methods. What started as a somewhat amorphous (but very enthusiastic, and usually quite successful somehow) “process” turned into a repeatable set of working sessions, asynchronous assignments for our clients, and research and synthesis on our parts. We figured out just the right way to start with the stakeholders, document their story, do the hard work, and then end up with a <em>messaging framework that succinctly and successfully communicated the value of the product</em>.</p>

<p>Once we settled on the basic outline of the process, we did it again. And again. And again. We’ve done this essential, foundational marketing engagement with more than 75 companies, from solo bootstrapped founders to public companies, and everything in-between. We expanded our initial notion of working with developer facing companies to working with a wide range of companies from <a href="https://testdouble.com/">award-winning software consultancies</a> to <a href="https://getchannels.com/">TV tech plays</a>, and even <a href="https://omg.network/">blockchain tech</a> (a category that barely existed when we started the company). We partnered with <a href="https://www.brightscout.com/">fabulous designers</a>, <a href="https://devrelate.io/">top content producers and community builders</a>, <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/">VC firms and event producers</a>, and we even started a <a href="https://epicconf.com/">little online conference with our friends.</a></p>

<p>Throughout all of this work, one thing remained very clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing is more important than the story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so it was a few months back when Brian and I tried to finally put a name to this process we’ve developed that we settled on a name: The Value Story Framework (VSF). This post will focus on what the VSF is, and it will be followed by another post outlining how the VSF can be put to use in nearly any company to start with solid foundations, set reasonable goals, and execute marketing like a pro.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/vsf1.png"></center>



<h2 id="the-value-story-framework">The Value Story Framework</h2>

<p>The VSF has three concrete outputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>value story</em>, which sums up the <em>Why</em> of the product</li>
  <li>The <em>refined persona</em>, which describes the <em>Who</em>, based on the essentials uncovered in the value story</li>
  <li>The <em>messaging framework</em>, which contains the words used to describe <em>What</em>, <em>Why</em>, and <em>How</em> to the refined persona</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the keys to the VSF is that <em>these outputs are entirely driven by inputs from the company’s key stakeholders</em>. We often tell our clients that they will have all of the good ideas during this process, and our job is to massage words, curate ideas, and present a complete, consistent package of ideas – something that can be difficult to do if you’ve never done it before.</p>

<p>The value story’s inputs come in the form of answering a series of questions about the origins of the company, focused initially on understanding <em>why</em> the people responsible for forming it came together. Beyond that, a timeline is established, and we also ask questions about other key factors: we get to know the competitive landscape a bit, we discuss important customers, and we discuss companies our clients admire and learn why.</p>

<p>Once we’ve established your <em>value story</em>, we move on to the <em>refined persona</em>. This persona document, which we’ve written about a few times over the years, is designed to allow you to focus in on what really matters when deciding what kind of marketing to do, when to do it, and what kind of content you need to produce. We ask stakeholders to list the key challenges of skills of the target persona, to consider what other tools they use and love, to tell us everything they know about what key roles and responsibilities that individual has at work. Once we’ve honed in on the <em>one initial persona</em> we’re going to use, we give it a memorable nickname and then move on to the part that most people actually think about when they think about marketing: messaging and positioning.</p>

<p>Our <em>messaging framework</em> itself is nothing unique – in fact we cribbed the structure of it by combining two different frameworks we found on the internet back when we were both marketing practitioners 5+ years ago. What does differentiate our process, however, is the process itself. While marketing is often done by thinking of cool sounding phrases and interesting angles first, and then matching the product’s marketing to it, we take the opposite approach.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use your story, focus on your persona, deliver your message</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We ask our clients to, <em>while considering the persona very closely</em>, produce lists of examples that support the basic argument that your product is a great fit for this persona. The messaging framework is assembled by combining existing facts about the product, aimed directly at the persona, in a way that leads us and the clients naturally to the great sounding slogans that companies often come to us in search of.</p>

<h2 id="prove-it">Prove it!</h2>

<p>We’ve been around a while, and worked with a decent number of clients you may have heard of, but the proof is in the pudding, right? How do you know that this stuff works at all? Beyond the fact that clients of ours who have used our frameworks directly have gone on to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, added at least that much in revenue, come to dominate their own market niches, etc., nothing communicates out impact as effectively as their own words. To that end, here are some of our favorite client quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Reify’s marketing framework helped us discover and communicate the value of FireHydrant in a way that has really resonated with our core audience.” – Robert Ross, CEO, FireHydrant</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Determined AI is a technically complicated product, and communicating our value proposition early on was always a challenge. Reify’s frameworks helped us calibrate, and we went to market with messaging that helped us communicate clearly and effectively.” – <em>Evan Sparks, Founder and CEO, Determined AI</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Reify helped us develop a messaging framework that not only enabled us to level up how we communicate with our customers, but was also instrumental in telling the story that resulted in our recent Series A financing. We have a confidence and focus now that we didn’t before.” - <em>Caleb Hailey, CEO, Sensu</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just because we love them so much, here are some of the great brand promises we’ve helped our clients come up with, in the context of any software company’s core marketing asset, the website homepage:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/hero_td.png"></center>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/hero_stackbit.png"></center>

<p>And there are tons more.</p>

<h2 id="so--how-do-i-use-it">So … How Do I Use It?</h2>

<p>We’re working on a few different ways to share the VSF with the world. The first step will be a followup to this post, which will contextualize the Value Story, Refined Persona, and Messaging Framework in day to day marketing operations. After that, we’re planning on opening up a software platform version of our framework that will allow <em>anyone to leverage these tools</em> to become the awesome marketers we know they’re capable of. Yes, after all this time teaching people how to fish, we’re going to be fishing ourselves a bit – and making a small software product to sell to early marketing teams.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="article">
<p>Today is a big day for me as after many months (or years depending how you look at it), I've <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brandvantage">finally launched the first product for my business, BrandVantage</a>.
This post is the story of how I started with one idea and ended up launching with a different one.</p>
<h2>The Original Idea: Let's build a digital brand expert!</h2>
<p>I worked as a web developer for a local web development agency for a number of years and in that time, I learnt a lot about how a variety of different businesses operated online.</p>
<p>There were a few key "problems" I found in common across many of those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-utilising analytics</li>
<li>Misunderstanding analytics</li>
<li>Not keeping on top of industry information</li>
<li>Lack of competitor analysis/understanding</li>
<li>Difficulty with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In moderate-to-large companies where you have marketing departments, most of this stuff can be covered by one or more staff dedicated to these things.
In smaller companies, the business owner is normally the one where these tasks fall on to, but they are already wearing many different hats.
It felt like something was here - if I could automate some of these tasks in different ways, I could both help business owners and earn myself some money along the way.</p>
<p>Automation of tasks, especially ones in analytics or SEO spaces, isn't a new idea.
In fact, I've seen many businesses in a similar space launch on Product Hunt over the years since starting, but that didn't deter me.
I was building <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+better+mousetrap"><em>a better mousetrap</em></a> and wanting to launch it at a lower price, not something truly innovative so it was going to be an uphill battle.
This area though, helping small businesses online be as efficient in tasks as some bigger businesses can, is something I felt passionately about so I proceeded anyway.</p>
<h3>Attempt One: Very Hacky (in PHP)</h3>
<p>Way back in 2015/16/17, while still at my full-time job, I spent nights and weekends building and tinkering on solutions to the problems business owners face.
It was a hacky PHP solution pulling real-time information from sources like Twitter, Google Analytics and Facebook.
A hacky approach seemed like a good idea as that seemed to be the way people launched things, do the quickest and hackiest thing you can to get it out the door.</p>
<p>While working on it, I had a few interested parties though what I built could barely be considered a prototype.
The thing was a mess.
I could do some basic queries, but it wasn't what I considered sellable and definitely not user-friendly, something I considered key to the product.
I was also running into technical problems with scale - any sufficiently complex query was performed real-time, which was getting more complicated.
Real-time processing had to be out.
I needed to pre-compute and store it in a database.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this more seriously and I didn't feel like a "quick and hacky" approach to building a product was right for me.
With this in mind, it seemed like a good opportunity to change the tech stack to something that would be better long term.</p>
<h3>Attempt Two: Slightly Less Hacky (in .NET)</h3>
<p>Moving to .NET felt like the smart move for me as at my job I had spent a lot more time working in .NET than PHP, plus I vastly prefered the tooling in .NET vs PHP.
That said, the .NET code I had worked on to-date would definitely be considered "legacy code".</p>
<p>My first version in .NET (specifically .NET Framework), predating my use of version control, was trying to keep costs low by using MySQL through Entity Framework.
After a lot of pain and suffering with that, I had a short stint of MSSQL before I settled upon MongoDB.</p>
<p>MongoDB might seem like a weird choice - there are some people that have very strong opinions about which type of database you should use.
Honestly it came down to a gut feel after messing around with it - it seemed more compatible to the way I was approaching problems than a relational database would.
I liked the code-first approach to Entity Framework so much though that I recreated the "feel" of Entity Framework for MongoDB with some custom code.
This later became an open source project of mine called <a href="https://www.mongoframework.com/">MongoFramework</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie, progress was... slow.
While I was putting quite a lot of time into working on it, it was still an extremely ambitious project.
I have strong feelings about building "MVPs" where some people focus too much on the "minimum" without enough focus on the "viable".
At the end of the day people buy products that meet their needs, and cutting too much out would meet no-ones needs.
If someone was going to use this, in a market with many competitors of varying quality, it had to do its job well.
There didn't seem much I could reasonably cut to make it any more minimal if I wanted people to buy it.</p>
<p>I kept working at it every night, building pieces to extract and store data from a variety of sources.
I was pulling in data from Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools (now called Google Search Console), Twitter, Facebook, IP Geolocation, DNS information and also from news articles.
What I thought I could do is once I had the different data sources together, I would write custom rules that could infer insights from individual or combined data sets.
These insights would form the basis of the "digital brand expert".
After all, that was the goal of the idea, something that could help out small business owners.</p>
<p>After 2 years of working on this in my spare time, it felt the right time to leave my job and go into this full time.
I felt like I was <em>so close</em> to launching and I just needed something more than the same day-to-day work.
So I did it - <a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/i-left-my-job-today-after-seven-years">I left my job after 7 years</a>.</p>
<h3>Going Full-time into the Idea</h3>
<p>Right out of the gate, I had moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core, was working on UI/UX improvements for the application and launched the website for it.
I worked with an accountant and a lawyer to setup the business, bought a trade mark for the product name, and I felt good like I was only a few months away from launching.
This feeling didn't last though...</p>
<p>Over time, it felt like I was taking two steps forward then one step back - some technical, some business related.
Sure, that is still progress, but having new issues crop up every day or so can really crush your motivation.</p>
<p>My best/happiest/most productive days were days I ignored or avoided different issues I had.
If I had a problem with the login system, I would focus on how the UX of the menus worked.
If I had a problem with data gathering, I would add more tests to the codebase.
While I didn't entirely ignore the problem, I would wait a week or two before I looked at it again, somewhat hoping it would solve itself - unfortunately that isn't how things work.</p>
<p>In time though, I got to a stage where it felt like I could launch and was hyping myself up until reality struck: I didn't actually build what I set out to build.</p>
<p>The UI/UX was good, I had strategies for deployment and plans for next steps, but it wasn't a "digital brand expert".
It was instead a glorified data store for information that people could better access through existing tools.
That's kinda a big problem!</p>
<p><img src="https://turnerj.com/blog/2020/images/a-better-mousetrap-ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="Gob Bluth saying &quot;I've made a huge mistake.&quot; from the TV Show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;"></p>
<p>When realising this I poured time into fixing that huge lapse in judgement, but I couldn't do it.
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't figure out how to build this rules engine.
It was like my entire thought process was just clouded.
I couldn't see the solution to the problem like I can for most other things.</p>
<p>This was depressing and I ended up having a month or so hiatus from working on it.
When I have had stints of not feeling like or not being able to do programming in the past, I try and spur it on again by watching some show or movie which has some strong relation to technology (fictional or not).
My go-to is usually something like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>, but this time I was rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a> where I found some inspiration.</p>
<h2>The Pivot: An API to the Internet</h2>
<p>Later in the series a lot of the focus is around the Web, and it was in these episodes where my thoughts about the Internet and the data on it have changed.
There is a quote from one of the main characters at the end of Season 3 that resonates with me:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost. The moment we try to tell people what to do with it, we've lost.
All we have to do is build a door and let them inside."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 3, Episode 10)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of information, it is searchable but generally unstructured.
People have managed to create all sorts of different pages in HTML, but in the process of making a website everything is designed for a human user.
It is this way for obvious reasons, <em>we</em> are the consumers of web pages after all... aren't we?</p>
<p>Behind these user-friendly web pages are usually other specific bits of markup, providing some level of structured data for specific situations.
Sometimes it is a description metatag for search engines, other times it might be <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metatags for social media links.
We build these things to help aid computers processing our web pages.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> was created.
This was a collaborative effort between Google, Bing and Yahoo (later that year, Yandex as well) with the mission to "create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond".
Through 3 different encodings (<a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/what-is-microdata-and-why-should-i-care">Microdata</a>, <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>), websites could express detailed structured data.</p>
<p>There is another quote from Halt and Catch Fire which I like:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets us to the thing."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 1, Episode 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As much as I like computers and programming, they are used to help us achieve other goals.
From my attempts of trying to build a "digital brand expert", I knew that data is fundamental to help build more advanced systems and give new insights.
Having easier access to other forms of data from web pages around the world may allow new and different tools to be built.</p>
<p>So I decided rather than try and solve a problem that I was clouded by, I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last few years have seen rapid automation of many Systems Administration/DevOps tasks. The new mantra is if you need to ssh to a server, your automation is not working right. But even for the occasional ssh access to the servers, the SSH authentication must be managed. Over the years, SSH has added many new features/techniques to enhance authentication and put some governance around it. This article is about the use of SSH Certificate-based authentication and why every organization, using SSH, must use it.</p><p>SSH Key-based authentication (aka passwordless login) has been with us for over two decades now. The mechanism works based on public-key cryptography. One adds his/her RSA/DSA key to the authorized_keys file on the server. The user with the corresponding private key can login without a password. It works great except for a few fundamental problems:</p><ol><li>When a user accesses the server using ssh for the first time, s/he always gets Trust On First Use (TOFU) warning.</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh -l alice mavrix5.dbsentry.com
The authenticity of host 'mavrix5.dbsentry.com (72.191.40.116)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:PoK81UWgOBMn6owOoHXjGoBLWqcJ4E9JCiLQyiFF60s.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
</code></pre><p>As the server is not trusted at this point, theoretically a man-in-the-middle attack could be launched. I tried to find damaging incidents of such attacks on the internet but could not find any. Nevertheless, the possibility exists and we’d be better off getting rid of this warning.</p><ol start="2"><li>When the number of servers increases, authorized_keys files proliferate and they are hard to manage. Moreover, once added they are active perpetually and have to be removed manually to block access to its corresponding private key. That is probably the reason why many security guys frown on the use of authorized_keys.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, the newer version of SSH included many improvements that give us the ability to centralize and better manage authorized_keys using <code>AuthorizedKeysCommand</code>. However, the TOFU remains. Although the solutions exist in either the use of SSHFP or SSH Certificates, their usage never caught on.</p><p>Having said that, in addition to taking care of TOFU, SSH Certificates have many more advantages/features (for e.g. certificate expiration, use of principals, etc) that enhance SSH authentication governance and should be used by all organizations that use SSH.</p><p>Instead of using complex X.509 style certificates, SSH chose to use their own simpler format of certificates, which can be easily managed using CLI <code>ssh-keygen</code>. In order to use SSH certificate-based authentication one needs to set up SSH Certificate Authority (CA). So, how does one set up SSH CA?</p><p>SSH Certificate authority can be setup on any computer with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. It is a key pair that is used to sign SSH Public Keys to generate certificates. It is recommended to set up two pairs of CA keys: one for host certificates and others for user’s certificates.</p><p>Use <code>ssh-keygen</code> to genearet CA Keys:</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_user_key
</code></pre><p>The above would generate two pairs of SSH Keys. for e.g.</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

<a href="https://keyper.dbsentry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyper</a>. Keyper is an Open Source SSH Key and Certificate-Based Authentication Manager. Keyper acts as an SSH Certificate Authority (CA) and it standardizes and centralizes the storage of SSH public keys and SSH Certificates for all Linux users in your organization saving significant time and effort it takes to manage SSH public keys and certificates on each Linux Server. Keyper also maintains an active Key Revocation List, which prevents the use of Key/Cert once revoked. Keyper is a lightweight container taking less than 100MB. It is launched either using Docker or Podman. You can be up and running within minutes instead of days.<br><code>&lt;/Shameless-Plug&gt;</code></p><p>Thats it folks! Happy more secure SSH’ing.</p></div></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/saas-vs-subscription | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/saas-vs-subscription">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>The three key characteristics of a SaaS company are: subscription, high margin, and scalability. There are so many new business models and new applications of existing business models into new markets that capture one or two of these, but in order to get the high multiples that SaaS companies achieve, it's critical to have all three. In addition, the "rule of thumb" metrics that I previously mentioned don't work so well in the absence of any of these characteristics. While the fundamental subscription math remains true, you have to dig much deeper to understand the impact on the cash flows, working capital needs, scalability, customer lifetime value and long term profitability to be able to assess the health and viability of a business.</p><p>For example, if we look at <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, which priced its IPO today (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1691421/000104746920003943/a2242013z424b4.htm">424B4 here</a>). Lemonade is a technology-enabled insurance company and insurance broker. I think most people would agree that it is not a software company. But if we look through the lens of these three characteristics and some of the key metrics, we can learn a lot about its long term prospects as a business.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Insurance is probably one of the original subscription businesses, with people paying annual or monthly premiums. Revenue comes in regularly to support the clients’ claims.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Assuming there's access to re-insurance and the capital to back up the insurance plans, this business is highly scalable and in a huge market.</li><li><strong>Margins:</strong> This is where it gets a bit more complicated. This is not a 90% margin, AWS-expense only business. It's a complicated financial cycle and risk assessment business with very different capital, accounting and cash flow dynamics. Lemonade runs a few different businesses with varying risk ownership which have an impact on gross profit, and overall they achieved a gross margin of 17% in 2019.</li></ol><p>Now let's take a look at some of the key metrics:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>LTV</strong>: In most software businesses, especially those either creating or selling into new markets, it's almost impossible to calculate a lifetime value because we don't have enough data on the lifetime of a customer. In the insurance business, there's tons of data going back decades for hundreds of millions of people. Insurance companies run on actuarial science, which one could argue is the original data science application. To put it lightly, they understand data and have lots of it. While in a new-fangled enterprise or consumer software business, lifetime value is a shot in the dark, in the insurance business it's not, where it's reasonable to expect your customers to stay with you for 25+ years.</li><li><strong>CAC Payback</strong>: Knowing you can keep your customers for a very long time is great and now you can calculate the CAC you can afford to invest in order to acquire them. Lemonade runs efficiently now with $1 of marketing to $2 of in-force premium on their platform. Gross margin-adjusted this obviously shifts the timeline out, but that's OK because the likelihood of keeping the customers for a long time is high. This introduces a new question: capital. With short paybacks, cash management isn't so much of a challenge, but as those payback times increase, so does the need to fund the working capital needs of the business. The time value of money becomes a factor here, but is manageable and calculable.</li></ol><p>So a quick look through the lens of the fundamental subscription concepts makes it clear that even though Lemonade is not a software business, it is a subscription business with some highly favorable business and customer economics.</p><p>And congrats to the Lemonade team on the IPO!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f6128d02bc85546e3a93976_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Faa34c7a7-d833-453f-a3cb-79b88beb7eda_1536x1025.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>MPEG is releasing three new video codecs in 2020-2021 called Versatile Video Coding (H.266), Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1), and Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2). Let’s take a look at the highlights of each of these codecs and what they bring to the table.</strong></p>




<h2 id="video-compression-is-critical-to-your-infrastructure"><span id="Video_Compression_is_Critical_To_Your_Infrastructure"></span>Video Compression is Critical To Your Infrastructure<span></span></h2>



<p>Video traffic is growing by the day and that is not going to stop any time soon. The pandemic might have stymied other industries, but, has actually given a filip to the streaming industry, because people are stuck indoors, and watching videos provides a much-needed escape from the daily routine!</p>



<p>Video Compression is a critical component in the video delivery pipeline and can make a massive make-or-break impression in the minds of the end-user. If you “tune” your encoders to maximize video quality, you’ll have to compromise on compression efficiency and spend more bits; and vice-versa. If you compromise on compression efficiency and create larger files, then you will have to spend more on CDN delivery costs.</p>



<p>So, the goal of every encoder team is to create a fine-balance between quality and bitrate. In other words, balance video quality with dollars.</p>



<p>The easiest way to perform this balancing act is to upgrade to the best encoder or encoding technology on the market. Hypothetically, this is simple, but practically, this is difficult. You need to make sure that the quality-complexity-efficiency trade-offs are met and decoder support is available amongst other things.</p>



<h2 id="the-failure-of-hevc"><span id="The_Failure_of_HEVC"></span>The Failure of HEVC<span></span></h2>



<p>When we talk about encoders, the discussion isn’t complete without mentioning H.264/AVC which is still ruling supreme since its introduction by MPEG (in 2003, I think). The MPEG announced a successor to H.264/AVC and called it H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) that had a slew of new coding tools such as quadtree decomposition, new picture types, SAO filtering, etc.</p>



<p>However, HEVC turned out to be a flop and the failure of HEVC had almost nothing to do with the algorithms. For HEVC R&amp;D teams, getting 20-30% gains over AVC was easy. </p>



<p><strong>You may disagree, but, as someone who wrote HEVC code for years, I stand by what I said.</strong></p>



<p>The “failure” of MPEG’s H.265/HEVC was due to patent-pools and licensing issues and this created the need for a new codec to fill the gap left by HEVC and to replace H.264/AVC (which by-design will struggle to compress 4K, UHD, and large resolutions).</p>



<p>In this regards, MPEG has announced that three new video codecs will soon be standardized and they are :-</p>



<ul><li>Versatile Video Coding (H.266)</li><li>Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1)</li><li>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2)</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a quick look at the objective of each of these codecs and see what gap they’re trying to plug, shall we?</p>

<p>Touted as a successor to HEVC, the Versatile Video Coding standard has a lofty goal of achieving at least a 30% improvement in compression efficiency over HEVC. This should be doable considering the allowance of the “10x complexity increase” that the committee has provided.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17074.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the MPEG Requirements document</a>&nbsp;for VVC (H.266), a few interesting points stand out with regards to compression efficiency, coding complexity, etc.</p>



<ul><li><strong>A substantial improvement in compression efficiency compared to HEVC Main Profile is required for the target application(s);</strong>&nbsp;at no point of the entire bit rate range shall it be worse than existing standard(s).&nbsp;<strong>30% bitrate reduction for the same perceptual quality is sufficient for some important use-cases and may justify a future video coding standard</strong>. Other use-cases may require higher bit-rate reductions such as 50%.</li><li><strong>Encoding complexity of approximately 10 times or more than that of HEVC</strong>&nbsp;is acceptable for many applications.</li><li><strong>The standard shall enable the use of efficient prediction structures (e.g. so-called open groups of pictures) without compromising from the fast and seamless representation switching capability between representations of different properties, such as different spatial resolutions.</strong></li><li>Support for&nbsp;<strong>progressive scanning shall be required for all Profiles and Levels</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>What stands out to me the most in the Requirements document are the references to “<strong>fast-switching</strong>” and “<strong>progressive scanning</strong>“. This is a clear indication of the importance that the MPEG body is placing on OTT streaming&nbsp;<em>(and the implicit absence of interlaced video in OTT)</em>.</p>



<p>This was a HUGE problem in HEVC where interlaced support was an after-thought; and it lead to a lot of code-wrangling to retro-fit interlaced support into commercial codecs. I hope VVC does not tread the same interlaced path.</p>



<p>The second comment about fast-switching is interesting and might put pressure on codec vendors to insert more IDRs in the bitstream to support smaller segment sizes and clean, fast, switching between profiles in the ABR bitrate ladder. The reference to open-gops is interesting, because Open-GOPs are very helpful in increasing compression efficiency – so this is something fun to watch out for.</p>



<p>Whenever a discussion about MPEG’s video codecs comes up, the elephant in the room has to be&nbsp;<strong>licensing</strong>. Fraunhofer HHI said in their&nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a>&nbsp;that,</p>



<blockquote><p>A uniform and transparent licensing model based on the FRAND principle (i.e., fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) is planned to be established for the use of standard essential patents related to H.266/VVC. For this purpose, the Media Coding Industry Forum (MC-IF) was founded.</p></blockquote>



<p>I hope VVC pans out because I’d love to see it in action crunching 4K/8K videos!</p>



<p><strong>Read <a href="https://ottverse.com/x266-vvc-multicoreware-opensource-encoder/">OTTVerse’s update of MulticoreWare’s x266 encoder for VVC.</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Reference</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/exploration/future-video-coding/requirements-a-future-video-coding-standard-v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Requirements for a Future Video Coding Standard V5</a></p>



<h2 id="essential-video-coding---evc-mpeg-5-part-1"><span id="Essential_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_EVC_(MPEG5_Part_1)"></span>Essential Video Coding – EVC (MPEG-5 Part 1)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 EVC or Essential Video Coding is an MPEG standard backed by Samsung, Huawei, Qualcomm, Divideon as a response to the patent pool mess that HEVC ran it that essentially stymied large-scale adoption of a powerful video compression standard.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17928.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements of the EVC standard</a>&nbsp;were very clearly specified by MPEG as follows –</p>



<ul><li>The test model should consist of two tool sets:&nbsp;<strong>a base and an enhanced tool set</strong></li><li>The base tool set should be configured with tools that were made public more than 20 years ago or for which a Type 1 declaration is received</li><li>There should be additional tools in the enhanced tool set, each of which shall provide a significant improvement in coding efficiency and be capable of being cleanly switched off on an individual basis</li></ul>



<p>EVC’s aim is crystal-clear – provide a royalty-free option for content producers while also providing adequate tools, algorithms, and knobs to produce higher quality video (than the base tool set). And, the enhancement layer’s tools (also referred to as the Main layer) will be subject to royalties.</p>



<p>Sounds good, eh?</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note the following sentence from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBC 2019 paper on EVC</a>&nbsp;and I quote,</p>



<blockquote><p>No considerations have been taken on licensing aspects of the technology other than a requirement for FRAND commitment by the contributors.&nbsp;<strong>Commercial aspects, and in particular, licensing aspects have been handled externally and independently of MPEG.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>They’ve been handled, huh? Okay cool, but I still cross my fingers and say a prayer when I hear “MPEG” and “Licensing” in the same sentence.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that EVC is adopted and supported in the industry quickly – its a good concept and means well.</p>



<p>In a future article, we will do a deep dive into the tools supported in the Base and the Main layers of EVC.</p>



<p><strong>Reference</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Emerging MPEG-5 EVC Standard – Applications, Technology, and Results presented at IBC 2019</a></p>



<h2 id="low-complexity-enhancement-video-coding---lcevc-mpeg-5-part-2"><span id="Low_Complexity_Enhancement_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_LCEVC_(MPEG5_Part_2)"></span>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding – LCEVC (MPEG-5 Part 2)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 Part 2 LCEVC is being introduced with the aim of increased compression efficiency for existing codecs at little or no-increase in coding complexity by using a base bitstream and an enhancement bitstream.</p>



<p>The LCEVC codec’s output is essentially a combination of a “base bitstream” produced by an existing video codec such as AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, etc. along with enhancement layers that can be used conditionally to improve the quality of the video.</p>



<p>If the decoder/end-device supports LCEVC, the enhancement layers are decoded, else, the base codec alone is used to decode the bitstream and the video is rendered to the user. This ensures backward-compatibility and encourages roll-out of the LCEVC codec without the fear of breaking the end-user’s experience.</p>



<p>This concept is nicely captured in the figure below taken from Guido Meardi’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/20191008/Documents/Guido_Meardi_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>&nbsp;at the ITU Workshop on the Future of Media in Geneva.</p>

<h2 id="what-next"><span id="What_Next"></span>What Next?<span></span></h2>



<p>I think 2020 and 2021 present great challenges and opportunities for the field of video compression.</p>



<p>With consumption increasing due to the COVID-19 situation, most content providers are under the gun to reduce their streaming costs. Dropping the bitrates is one way of reducing your streaming costs, but, conversely, it will be hard to compete with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Peacock, fuboTV, DAZN with poor video quality.</p>



<p>If the compression experts can pull off VVC’s goals of 30% bitrate savings over HEVC, then it will be a huge win. The only thing they’ll have to ensure is that they don’t blow their foot off with licensing issues (<em>a-la-HEVC</em>). If things work out properly, VVC should be a good competitor to AV1 especially at high resolutions such as 4K and 8K.</p>



<p><em><strong>However</strong></em>, that being said, I think that among the three codecs …</p></div></div>

</section><p>What if I told you that $2=1$? You may say I’m wrong. OK, well, what if I proved it to you? We can both agree that there’s an $x$ and a $y$ where $x = y$. From there, <a href="https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/one-equals-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiply, subtract, factorise, divide, substitute, divide again</a>, and you get $2 = 1$.</p>
<p>Still not happy? You’re probably unconvinced by my so-called ‘proof’. OK, I say, and, after a minute, hand you a sheet of paper with the following hastily scrawled on it: <a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=204%2C188" alt="" width="204" height="188" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=300%2C277 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?w=470 470w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>It’s better, but you’re still displeased. This time, I’ve made clear what steps I’m taking from $x = y$ to $2 = 1$. However, you point out, I don’t connect any of these steps. Nodding slowly, I take my time and write out a very nice, orderly proof, complete with justifications for each line:<a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=454%2C241" alt="" width="454" height="241" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=300%2C160 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=1024%2C544 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=768%2C408 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>At this point, you spot my mistake: in going from line 4 to 5, I have divided both sides by $x-y$. But we began with the assumption that $x = y$, meaning that $x-y = 0$, and dividing by 0 is not defined! This means that lines 5 to 7 are operating on nonexistent values and are therefore meaningless.</p>
<p>You’re happy with yourself, but something is bothering you. To reveal my mistake, you asked me to be more precise. But why stop here? Because you found what you were looking for? That’s not how truth is found.</p>
<p>My proof, like all proofs, is a path from one statement to another, just as we may follow the path from $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to $x = \big(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\big)/{2a}$, or from the existence of rectangles to the transitivity of parallelism (see below). Along this path I have made several intermediate statements, and linked them together with justifications. You found that one of my links is flawed, and you wonder how we know that the others aren’t also wrong. You begin to question foundational principles, wondering, for instance, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/805939/24325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why we’re even allowed to do the same thing to both sides of an equation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Euclidean geometry:</strong> For the unfamiliar—Euclidean geometry (standard geometry on a flat surface) rests on 5 assumptions, one of which (the <em>parallel postulate</em>) has historically been regarded as ugly. In attempting to eliminate the parallel postulate, mathematicians have found numerous other statements that are equivalent to it, such as that a rectangle exists or that parallelism is transitive.</p>
<p>You keep digging deeper and deeper, questioning more and more of what you previously took to be correct. Eventually, you come across a piece of mathematics that is perhaps the most beautiful and elegant thing you’ve ever laid your eyes upon: <em>natural deduction</em>.</p>
<h2>Natural deduction</h2>
<p>Natural deduction is one result of asking for deeper and deeper justification when doing maths. A system of natural deduction is a set of very simple, almost irrefutable rules that act to formalise our intuition about what is <em>definitely true</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_15535"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15535" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=124%2C71" alt="" width="124" height="71" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?w=293 293w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 124px) 100vw, 124px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15535">Reiteration (R): if $P$, then $P$.</p></div>
<p>These rules include such things as <em>reiteration</em>, which simply allows us to repeat ourselves. Precisely, reiteration says that if you know that a statement $P$ is true, then you can conclude that $P$ is true. This is hardly controversial.</p>
<div id="attachment_15536"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15536" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=193%2C120" alt="" width="193" height="120" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?w=422 422w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15536">Conjunction introduction ($\land$I): if $P$ and $Q$ then $P\land Q$.</p></div>
<p>There are two rules for the natural idea of ‘and’. First is the so-called <em>conjunction introduction</em> rule, stating that if you know that $P$ and $Q$ are both true, then you may conclude $P \land Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ and $Q$’. On the other side, we have <em>conjunction elimination</em>, stating that if you know that $P \land Q$ is true, then you may conclude $P$ and also may conclude $Q$.</p>
<div id="attachment_15537"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15537" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=176%2C121" alt="" width="176" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?w=384 384w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=300%2C205 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15537">Conjunction elimination ($\land$E): if $P\land Q$, then $P$ and $Q$.</p></div>
<p>These rules don’t feel like they do much besides swapping out ‘and’ for ‘$\land$’; however, doing so is important for formality and precision.</p>
<div id="attachment_15538"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15538" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=172%2C78" alt="" width="172" height="78" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?w=373 373w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=300%2C136 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15538">Disjunction introduction ($\lor$I): if $P$, then $P\lor Q$.</p></div>
<p>Things start to get tricky with the rules codifying ‘or’. The first, <em>disjunction introduction</em>, tells us that if $P$ is true, then you may conclude $P \lor Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ or $Q$’: if I am hungry, then it’s also true that I’m either hungry or tired.</p>
<div id="attachment_15539"><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15539" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=258%2C332" alt="" width="258" height="332" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?w=568 568w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=232%2C300 232w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15539">Disjunction elimination ($\lor$E): if $P\lor Q$ and from $P$ we can prove $X$ and from $Q$ we can prove $X$, then $X$.</p></div>
<p>The second rule, <em>disjunction elimination</em>, states that if $P \lor Q$ is true, and from $P$ you can prove $X$, and from $Q$ you can prove $X$, then you may conclude $X$. More colloquially, if either $P$ or $Q$ is true, and in both cases $X$ is true, too, then $X$ is true. For example, if I’m either well-rested or well-fed, and being well-rested makes me happy, and being well-fed makes me happy, then I must be happy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15540"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15540" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=222%2C212" alt="" width="222" height="212" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?w=472 472w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=300%2C287 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15540">Implication introduction ($\Rightarrow$I): if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then $P\Rightarrow Q$.</p></div>
<p>Then come the rules regarding implication. We have <em>implication introduction</em>, stating that if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then we may conclude $P \Rightarrow Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ implies $Q$’. And we have <em>implication elimination</em> (also known as <em>modus ponens</em>), which states that if $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true and $P$ is true, then we can conclude $Q$. If the weather being rainy implies that I am cosy, and the weather is rainy, then I must be cosy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15541"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15541" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=220%2C121" alt="" width="220" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?w=477 477w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=300%2C165 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15541">Implication elimination ($\Rightarrow$E): if $P\Rightarrow Q$ and $P$, then $Q$.</p></div>
<p>Finally, we come to the most arcane rules, those handling negation. The negation of $P$ is written $\neg P$ and pronounced ‘not $P$’. Before talking about the $\neg P$ rules, however, we must first introduce a new symbol: $\bot$ (pronounced ‘bottom’), which represents impossibility or contradiction. We can then introduce <em>bottom introduction</em>, which states that if both $P$ and $\neg P$ are true, which is absurd (usually… there are systems of logic that admit both $P$ and $\neg P$ at the same time, called <em>paraconsistent</em> logics), then we can conclude $\bot$, to represent this impossibility.</p>
<div id="attachment_15542"><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15542" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=195%2C134" alt="" width="195" height="134" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?w=383 383w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=300%2C206 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15542">Bottom introduction ($\bot$I): if $P$ and $\neg P$, then $\bot$.</p></div>
<p>We’re then able to make use of $\bot$ through <em>negation introduction</em>, which states that if from $P$ we can prove $\bot$, then we can conclude $\neg P$. This is reasonable; if $P$ being true led to a contradiction, then $P$ isn’t true, so $\neg P$ is.</p>

<p>Finally we have <em>negation elimination</em>. This one is a nice easy way to end: it says that if we know $\neg \neg P$, then we can conclude $P$. If something isn’t not true, then it must be true!</p>

<p>And with that, we have completed (one kind of) natural deduction, laying out a framework for proofs based on undeniable principles so that we can be <em>completely</em> confident in our results.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering, hey, maths is about numbers and shapes and functions and vector fields, but all we’ve been working with are $P$s and $Q$s! Not a single $n$ or $x$, let alone an $f$, has been written so far!</p>
<p>Fear not! Purely logical systems such as natural deduction are key ingredient for building typical maths. For example, to define numbers, we may first extend to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-precise-difference-between-propositional-and-predicate-logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicate logic</a>, then construct the naturals (via the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a></em>), which we’ll use to make the <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~pavel/syllabi_old/aluffi_321/NZ.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integers</a> and the <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/groisser/files/rationals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationals</a> (via equivalence classes), then finally the reals (via <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedekind cuts</a></em>).</p>
<p>So, in fact, we still we get to work with all the maths we’re used to! Plus, due to the use of natural deduction, we have the added benefit of being confident about what we’re doing at every layer of abstraction!</p>
<p><strong>Predicate and propositional logic:</strong> The logic we’ve been building, with $\land$, $\lor$, $\Rightarrow$, $\neg$, and $\bot$, is known as <em>propositional</em> or <em>zeroth-order logic</em>. <em>Predicate</em> or <em>first-order logic</em> is an extension of propositional logic wherein our statements ($P$, $Q$, $X$, etc) may be parametrised. So as well as having $H$ mean that ‘I am hungry’, we may also have $\mathcal H(x)$ mean that ‘$x$ is hungry’. Additionally, predicate logic includes two <em>quantifiers</em>, $\forall$ and $\exists$, which respectively mean ‘for every’ and ‘there exists’: $\forall x \mathcal H(x)$ means that everyone is hungry, and $\exists x \mathcal H(x)$ means that (at least) one person is hungry.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like I was at age 17, or anything like how I portrayed you in the beginning of this article, you’re drooling right now. It’s like all of your fantasies regarding rigour and precision have been heard and answered by divine mathematicians.</p>
<p>But maybe you’re not intrinsically motivated by rigour, so you’re less excited by natural deduction. Which is fine! I’m not hurt. Maybe a little bit. Or maybe you just feel that this is overkill—did you <em>really</em> need all this work to know that $2 \neq 1$? Or maybe you’re not convinced that these rules are correct; perhaps you don’t agree that from $\neg \neg P$ we can conclude $P$.</p>
<p><strong>Excluding the middle:</strong> If you don’t agree, you are not alone! That $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$ is a consequence of a rule called the <em>law of excluded middle</em>, which states that $P \lor \neg P$. (This law is built-in to the system of natural deduction that we created.) Some mathematicians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>intuitionists</em> or <em>constructionists</em></a>) reject the law of excluded middle, thus also forfeiting that $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$. One reason to question the law of excluded middle is that it allows us to state that something exists without stating what it is. For instance, we are able to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/104121/243259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prove that an irrational number raised to the power of an irrational number can be rational</a>, but <em>without</em> giving an actual example. If we reject the law of excluded middle, then all such proofs must <em>actually construct</em> an example.</p>
<p>Still, I posit, natural deduction is worth your time. Because we’ve been so rigorous in building the system up, we gain the benefit of knowing <em>exactly what we’re talking about</em>. Before establishing such precision, we may have used $P \Rightarrow Q$, but without a sense of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Service-to-service authentication is the ability of one service to identify its clients. It’s a good idea to ensure that a service accepts requests only from specified services. But how to implement access controls (authorization)?</p>
<p>For instance, only the service <code>cart</code> is granted to bind to the service <code>invoice</code>, and only two services <code>invoice</code> and <code>billing</code> are granted to bind to the service <code>payment</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://regeda.me/s2s_seq.svg" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Firstly, we must decide on the unique key of service, the attribute of a caller to be verified by a recipient. Do you think the IP address or hostname is manageable in the infrastructure at scale? It’s challenging in a multi-tenant environment where different personas can park successively the same network identity in a short period.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/X509-certificate">X.509 certificate</a> which is a widely used standard for network security and identity verification.</p>
<h2 id="give-a-secure-identity-to-components">Give a secure identity to components</h2>
<p>We could go over the long way to <a href="https://www.semurity.com/how-to-setup-your-own-certificate-authority-ca-using-openssl/">set up your own Certificate Authority and sign a certificate using OpenSSL</a>. For the sake of simplicity, I use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl"><strong>sfssl</strong></a> toolkit for certificates management.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/...
</code></pre></div><h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>The <code>sfssl</code> toolkit expects two files to generate a certificate:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>config.json</code> – settings for the issuer</li>
<li><code>csr.json</code> – request for a certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file <code>config.json</code> contains settings for the Certificate Authority. We are interested in the <code>profiles</code> section for our certificates:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"signing"</span>: {
    <span>"profiles"</span>: {
      <span>"service"</span>: {
        <span>"usages"</span>: [
          <span>"signing"</span>,
          <span>"key encipherment"</span>,
          <span>"server auth"</span>,
          <span>"client auth"</span>
        ],
        <span>"expiry"</span>: <span>"720h"</span>
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The file <code>csr/ca.json</code> contains the request for the Certificate Authority certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"CN"</span>: <span>"Demo Citadel"</span>,
  <span>"names"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"C"</span>: <span>"US"</span>,
      <span>"L"</span>: <span>"San Francisco"</span>,
      <span>"O"</span>: <span>"Citadel, Inc."</span>,
      <span>"ST"</span>: <span>"CA"</span>
    }
  ],
  <span>"ca"</span>: {
    <span>"expiry"</span>: <span>"86700h"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The file <code>csr/service.json</code> contains the request for the service certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"CN"</span>: <span>"citadel.xyz"</span>,
  <span>"names"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"C"</span>: <span>"US"</span>,
      <span>"L"</span>: <span>"San Francisco"</span>,
      <span>"O"</span>: <span>"Citadel, Inc."</span>,
      <span>"ST"</span>: <span>"CA"</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="generating">Generating</h3>
<p>The Certificate Authority certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">cfssl gencert -initca csr/ca.json | cfssljson -bare pki/ca –
</code></pre></div><p>Meantime, we reached the important step and have to define the unique attribute of service. Usually, the service has a name and it belongs to a company. Hence we need to stamp the identity <code>citadel:srv-invoice</code> into the handcrafted X.509 certificate along with the server hostname <code>host1.infra.citadel.net</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">cfssl gencert <span>\
</span><span></span>-ca pki/ca.pem -ca-key pki/ca-key.pem <span>\
</span><span></span>-config config.json <span>\
</span><span></span>-profile service <span>\
</span><span></span>-hostname <span>'host1.infra.citadel.net,citadel:srv-invoice'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>csr/service.json | cfssljson -bare pki/srv-invoice-host1 -
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s check the resulted alternative name from the issued certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">openssl x509 -in pki/srv-invoice-host1.pem -text | grep -A <span>1</span> <span>'Alternative Name'</span>
</code></pre></div><pre><code>X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:host1.infra.citadel.net, URI:citadel:srv-invoice
</code></pre><p>💚 The service identity <code>citadel:srv-invoice</code> successfully assigned to the server <code>host1.infra.citadel.net</code>.</p>
<h2 id="consume-the-service-identity-in-go">Consume the service identity in Go</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the callback <code>VerifyConnection</code> of <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#Config"><code>tls.Config</code></a> was introduced in Go 1.15:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>tls</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Config</span> <span>struct</span> {
    <span>VerifyConnection</span> <span>func</span>(<span>ConnectionState</span>) <span>error</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>The Go documentation says: if the function returns an error, the TLS handshake is aborted. Hence we are enabled to restrain the TLS connection permit by own.</p>
<p>For testing purposes, we make the simplest access control by a prefix:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>var</span> <span>errAccessForbidden</span> = <span>errors</span>.<span>New</span>(<span>"access forbidden"</span>)

<span>func</span> <span>verifyPeerPrefix</span>(<span>prefix</span> <span>string</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>tls</span>.<span>ConnectionState</span>) <span>error</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(<span>s</span> <span>tls</span>.<span>ConnectionState</span>) <span>error</span> {
		<span>// The first element is the leaf certificate
</span><span></span>		<span>// that the connection is verified against.
</span><span></span>		<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>uri</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>s</span>.<span>PeerCertificates</span>[<span>0</span>].<span>URIs</span> {
			<span>if</span> <span>strings</span>.<span>HasPrefix</span>(<span>uri</span>.<span>String</span>(), <span>prefix</span>) {
				<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
			}
		}
		<span>return</span> <span>errAccessForbidden</span>
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>Then prepare <code>tls.Config</code> for the server listener. Necessarily, the callback should be provided in conjunction with the mutual TLS authentication enabled:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>cfg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>tls</span>.<span>Config</span>{
	<span>ClientAuth</span>:       <span>tls</span>.<span>RequireAndVerifyClientCert</span>,
	<span>VerifyConnection</span>: <span>verifyPeerPrefix</span>(<span>"citadel:srv"</span>),
}
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>The constant <code>tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert</code> of <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#ClientAuthType"><code>tls.ClientAuthType</code></a> indicates the server will request a client certificate and if none is provided the session will terminate, if the client certificate cannot be verified (a corresponding CA (root) certificate cannot be found) the session will also be terminated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full source of the example server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<p>Hooray! We implemented service-to-service authorization based on well-known standards (X.509 certificates and the TLS protocol) with vital features out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity issuing</strong> through the standard toolkit for generating certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Identity verification</strong> by the trusted Certificate Authority</li>
<li><strong>Identity expiration and revocation</strong>  to be confident that the temporary access or a compromised certificate have never been used for years.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the approach has the undeniable advantage to be fluently integrated into the running infrastructure leveraging the TLS protocol. For instance, traffic in Service Mesh is not only secured by TLS, but it’s also hardened by access and identity management through X.509 certificates.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><div><main><section><p><a href="https://vectorized.io/redpanda-raison-detre">As I have previously observed</a>, software does not run on category theory, it runs on superscalar CPUs with wide, multi-channel GB/s memory units and NVMe SSD access times in the order of 10-100’s of microseconds. The reason some software written a decade ago - on a different hardware platform - feels slow is because it fails to exploit the advances in modern hardware.</p>
<p>The new bottleneck in storage systems is the CPU. SSD devices are 100-1000x faster than spinning disks and are 10x cheaper today[1] than they were a decade ago, from $2,500 down to $200 per Terabyte. Networks have 100x higher throughput in public clouds from 1Gbps to 100Gbps.</p>
<p>Although computers did, in fact, get faster, single-core speeds remain roughly the same. The reason being that CPU frequency has a cubic dependency on power consumption, and we’ve hit a wall. Instruction level parallelism, prefetching, speculative execution, branch prediction, deep hierarchy of data caches and instruction caches, etc, have contributed to programs <em>feeling</em> faster when you interact with them, but in the datacenter, the material improvements have come from the rise in core count. While the instructions per clock are 3x higher than a decade ago, core count is up 20x.</p>
<p>This is all to say that the rise of readily available, many-core systems necessitates a different approach for building infrastructure. Case in point[9]: in order to take full advantage of 96 vCPUs on a i3en.metal on AWS, you’ll need to find a way to exploit sustained CPU clock speed of 3.1 GHz, 60 TB of total NVMe instance storage, 768 GiB of memory and NVMe devices capable of delivering up to 2 million random IOPS at 4 KB block sizes. This kind of beast necessitates a new kind of storage engine and threading model that leverages these hardware advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://vectorized.io/tpc-buffers/vectorized.io/redpanda">Redpanda</a> - a Kafka-API compatible system for mission critical workloads[3] - addresses all of these issues. It uses a thread-per-core architecture with Structured Message Passing (SMP) to communicate between these pinned threads. Threading is a foundational decision for any application, whether you are using a thread-pool, pinned threads with a network of Single Producer Single Consumer SPSC[7] queues, or any other of the advanced Safe Memory Reclamation (SMR) techniques, threading is your ring-0, the true kernel of your application. It tells you what your sensitivity is for blocking - which for Redpanda is less than 500 microseconds - otherwise, Seastar’s[4] reactor will print a stack trace warning you of the blocking since it effectively injects latency on the network poller.</p>
<p>Once you have decided on your threading model, the next step is your memory model and ultimately, for storage engines, your buffer management. In this post, we’ll cover the perils of buffer management in a thread-per-core environment and describe <code>iobuf</code>, our solution for a 0-copy memory management in the world of Seastar.</p>
<h2 id="Request-Flow-Architecture">Request Flow Architecture<a href="#Request-Flow-Architecture" aria-label="Request Flow Architecture permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Redpanda uses a <em>single</em> pinned thread per core architecture to do everything. Network polling, submitting async IO to the kernel, reaping events, triggering timers, scheduling compute tasks, etc. Structurally, it means nothing can block for longer than 500 microseconds, or you’ll be introducing latency in other parts of your stack. This is an incredibly strict programming paradigm, but this opinionated idea forces a truly asynchronous system, whether you like it or not as the programmer.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/31d1a730c507b605e6c1ebea60eb1e56/flow.svg" alt="Kafka request flow">
<small>
Figure 1: request flow architecture. Core-0 accepts the connection from the Kafka Java client and becomes the source core. After the request goes through the metadata cache(valid request) it filters through the partition router which decides to send the request to core-1, the destination core. Core-1 then accepts the write through the Raft-log interface and saves it to disk.
</small></p>
<p>The challenge in a TpC (thread-per-core) architecture[8] is that all communication between cores is explicit. This muscles the programmer into implementing algorithms that favor core-locality (d-cache, i-cache) over the straightforward multi-threaded implementations via mutexes. This imperative has to be co-designed with the asynchronicity of a <strong>future&lt;&gt;</strong>-based implementation.</p>
<p>For our Kafka-API implementation as shown in Figure 1, we explicitly trade memory usage to reduce latency and increase throughput by materializing key components. The metadata Cache is materialized on every core since every request has to know if the partition exists, and that that particular machine is, in fact, the leader of the partition. The Partition Router maintains a map of which logical core actually owns the underlying Kafka partition on the machine. Other things like Access Control Lists (ACLs) are deferred until the request reaches the destination core since they can get unwieldy in memory footprint.  We have no hard and fast rule of what we materialize on every core vs. what is deferred for the destination core, and it’s often a function of memory (smaller data structures are good candidates for broadcast), computation (how much time is spent deciding) and frequency of access (very likely operations tend to get materialized on every core).</p>
<p>One question remaining is how, exactly, does memory management work in a TpC architecture? How does data actually travel from L-core-0 to L-core-66 safely using a network of SPSC queues within a fully asynchronous execution model where things can suspend at any point in time?</p>
<h2 id="struct-iobuf--">struct iobuf { };<a href="#struct-iobuf--" aria-label="struct iobuf   permalink"></a></h2>
<h3 id="Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC">Redpanda’s 0-copy buffer management for TpC<a href="#Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC" aria-label="Redpandas 0 copy buffer management for TpC permalink"></a></h3>
<p>To understand <strong>iobuf</strong>, we need to understand the actual memory constraints of Seastar, our TpC framework. During program bootstrap, Seastar allocates the full memory of the computer and splits it evenly across all the cores. It consults the hardware to understand what memory belongs to each particular core, reducing inter-core traffic to main memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/efa273909c5b695bf7f978f77b32c12b/seastar_model.svg" alt="Seastar mental model">

Figure 2: Copy from alexgallego.org (<a href="https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html</a>) Seastar threading model. Seastar uses a network of SPS queues to send messages to neighboring cores. Similar to other message passing or actor models like Erlang, Orleans and Pony, once a function is futurized, transitive functions too will become futurized. Both approaches, however, are intrinsically safe. The programmer worries about correctness and construction while the frameworks worry about efficient execution. Counter to general wisdom, it is actually faster and more scalable than the synchronous approach. While the machine does more work, it is executing your code simultaneously. This simultaneity is the key to finishing work sooner.
</small></p>
<p>As Figure 2 suggests, memory allocated on core-0, <em>must</em> be deallocated on core-0. However, there is no way to guarantee that a Java or Go client connecting to Redpanda will actually communicate with the exact core that owns the data.</p>
<p>At its core, an iobuf is a ref-counted, fragmented-buffer-chain with deferred deletes that allows Redpanda to simply share a view of a remote core’s parsed messages as the fragments come in, without incurring a copy overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/6df6fc00e05201d068dc5d03e080606a/iobuf.svg" alt="iobuf architecture"></p>
<p>The fragmented buffers abstraction is not new. The linux kernel has <strong>sk_buff</strong>[5] and the freebsd kernel has an <strong>mbuf</strong>[6] which are roughly similar. The additional extension of an iobuf is that it works in the TCP model leveraging Seastar’s network of SPSC queues to have proper deletes in addition to being able to share sub-views arbitrarily, tailored for a storage-like workload.</p>
<p>Removing the C++ templates, allocators, pooling, pointer caching, etc, one could think of an iobuf as being equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>fragment</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span> data<span>;</span>
    size_t ref_count<span>;</span>
    size_t capacity<span>;</span>
    size_t size<span>;</span>

    fragment<span>*</span> next<span>;</span>  
    fragment<span>*</span> prev<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>iobuf</span> <span>{</span>
    fragment<span>*</span> head<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The origins of iobuf are rooted in one of our central product tenets for building a Kafka® replacement for mission critical systems - giving users 10x lower tail latencies for most workloads. Aside from a thread-per-core architecture, the memory management would have been our second bottleneck if not designed from the ground up for latency. On long running storage systems, memory fragmentation is a real problem, and one that is eventually either met with a proper solution (iobuf), stalls or an OOM.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors skbuff and mbuff, iobuf allows us to optimize and train our memory allocator with predictable memory sizes. Here is our iobuf allocation table logic:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>io_allocation_size</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> size_t max_chunk_size <span>=</span> <span>128</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span>   </code></pre></div>
<p>Predictability, memory pooling, fixed sizes, size capping, fragmented traversal, etc, are all known techniques to reduce latency. Asking for contiguous and variably sized memory could cause the allocator to compact all of the arenas and reshuffle a lot of bytes for what could be a short-lived request, not only injecting latency on the request path, but for the entire system since we have exactly one thread performing all operations.</p>
<p>Hardware is the platform. When we ask the network layer to give us exactly 11225 bytes in contiguous memory, we are simply asking the allocator to linearize an empty buffer of that exact size and for the network layer to copy bytes as the fragments come from the hardware into the destination buffer. There is ultimately no free lunch when it comes to trying to squeeze every single ounce of performance of your hardware and often it requires re-architecting from zero.</p>

They are doing this through the use of third party tracking scripts, cookies, and pixels which they have embedded on their taxpayer funded official .house.gov and .senate.gov domains. This includes notable consumer privacy advocates such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey, Josh Hawley, and Ron Wyden, as well as the Senate and House leaders who are in charge of the subcommittees that focus on consumer data privacy and big tech antitrust.&nbsp;
</p><p>A handful of congressmen also have installed an impressive array of advertising and marketing tech on their .gov websites, sending data about their .gov websites’ visitors to both domestic and foreign data brokers and advertising exchanges such as Avocet, OnAudience, Adobe Demdex, Eyeota, and Weborama. Several congressional websites use more than fifteen times as many third party tracking scripts as ebay.com. Multiple sites also utilize a social media feed widget that communicates with servers belonging to a company based on the outskirts of Moscow, Russia when users open their websites. One congressman even has actual Google Ads iframes embedded on his .house.gov domain.&nbsp;</p><p>A few congressmen may be utilizing their taxpayer funded .gov websites to gather data for their re-election campaigns, which may potentially be in violation of Congressional ethics rules, Federal Election Commission regulations, and Constitutional protections against unwarranted government surveillance.</p>

</ol><p>If you are a technically minded individual or want to jump straight into interesting findings, I recommend you go directly to the Results and Analysis sections. If you want some background on consumer privacy and how tracking tech works, this Introduction section is designed to provide some background context.</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In recent months, there have been increased calls in the US Capitol for strengthening consumer privacy protections and to evaluate the amount of influence tech giants such as Facebook and Google wield over social media, digital advertising, and news dissemination.</p><p>
These two companies command over <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-demand-for-digital-advertising-plummets-google-and-facebook-could-have-shrinking-revenues-2020-04-28">70 percent</a> of the U.S. market share for digital ads. Google and Facebook built their sprawling billion-dollar businesses by providing a myriad of ‘free’ services - social media, content feeds, search results, video, photo sharing, email, and messenger services. They also provide free software tools such as Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel, which website developers can embed within their pages to track user behavior. These consumer and business tools follow hundreds of millions of users around on the internet, placing cookies on users’ browsers and tracking scripts on websites to log peoples’ visits, thereby building detailed profiles of consumers based on their browsing habits and interests. These datasets can then be used to target potential consumers with targeted shoe, vacation, housing, job or political ads.</p><p>
Google and Facebook’s tracking scripts and pixels are among their most popular ‘free’ software tools, and they appear on websites in every corner of the internet. Even lawmakers calling for greater privacy protections use these tools on their congressional .gov websites purportedly to “improve” their websites. What they may actually be doing is sending their constituents’ data to Google and Facebook, thereby augmenting Google and Facebook’s virtual profiles of users.</p><p>There is no shortage of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle clamoring to crown themselves as the champions of our right to privacy online.&nbsp;
</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (MA), one of the most vocal critics of Big Tech, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/3/20965463/tech-2020-candidate-policies-online-data-equifax">argues</a> that breaking up Big Tech would drive accountability into their models and give “people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold.”&nbsp;</p><p>
Senator Josh Hawley (MO), a rising Republican star, teamed up with Senator Mark Warner (VA) to introduce the <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senators-warner-and-hawley-introduce-bill-force-social-media-companies-disclose-how-they-are">Do Not Track Act</a> to allow Americans to opt-out of having their data collected. Sen. Hawley explains, “When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads.” He continues, “Tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.”</p><p>Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) put forward the Mind Your Own Business Act, which he bills&nbsp; as “the strongest-ever protections for Americans’ private data” that “goes further than Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).”&nbsp;</p><p>
<strong>Given these lawmakers’ promises to protect Americans’ online privacy, I was curious how their own, taxpayer funded, .</strong><strong><em>gov</em></strong><strong> websites fare in protecting and respecting users’ privacy?</strong> Do their congressional websites, paid for and maintained with taxpayer funds, hold up to their own standards?</p><p>A few months ago, while I was working on a <a href="https://adalytics.io/">chrome extension</a> to collect and analyze digital ads, I noticed many representatives’ websites host dozens of 3rd party cookies and tracking scripts on their .house.gov and .senate.gov websites. This means that the moment you (or a child in your household) visits your Senator or Congressperson’s website, all sorts of information about you--your IP address, physical location, how much time you spend on the page, what browser you’re using, the dimensions of your computer monitor, your computer’s operating system, social media identifiers -- can potentially be sent over to Google, Facebook, and other third party companies.</p><h2 id="context">Context</h2><p>So how exactly do data brokers or tech companies track users across different internet domains? Here I will provide a quick background on the technical means through which tracking tools operate.</p><p>When you open a website such as example.com, your computer’s browser makes a network call over the internet to that domain’s servers, which return an initial HTML document. That document contains instructions your browser parses to show text and styling, as well as further instructions for loading images or dynamic Javascript elements.</p><p>By making that initial request to example.com, your device established a quick internet connection that allowed example.com’s servers to see a few pieces of information about your browser, including your IP address. Services such as <a href="https://ipinfo.io/">ipinfo.io</a> allow one to translate a numeric IP address into a geographic location, such as that of your house or the cafe whose WiFi you are using.&nbsp;</p><p>If a web developer installed third party javascript files on a website, this serves as an embedded instruction to make your browser fetch additional files from another domain besides the one you are currently perusing. Tracking scripts such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel can be loaded this way, and they then act as data sensors, transmitting additional data points back not only to example.com, but also to Google and Facebook’s servers. Certain audience management or data brokers operate on this principle - a developer installs the data broker’s Javascript on their website, and then the data broker can gather information about the website’s visitors and cross-reference with other website’s data, as well as real world data such as credit cars, public records, and real estate ownership records.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to javascript, many trackers load tiny, transparent images referred to as <a href="https://adtechbook.clearcode.cc/user-identification/">pixels</a>. Facebook <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#facebook-pixel">Pixel</a> is such an image. When a website configures Facebook Pixel on its pages, that causes users’ browsers to make a network call to Facebook’s servers to retrieve that tiny image. Facebook Pixel can identify a particular user’s Facebook account ID and relay that over the network. This information can then be used to target ads, including potentially <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/political-advertising-on-social-media-platforms/">political</a> ads. Facebook Pixel can track activity even when a user is not logged into their Facebook account. Facebook’s targeted ad system ‘learns’ from Pixel events as well as custom user profile lists marketers can upload to create a target audience profile.&nbsp;</p><p>When your browser fetches images, javascript, or other resources after parsing a webpage’s HTML instructions, it can also receive instructions to store short pieces of text known as ‘cookies’. A first party cookie is one that is set by the domain you are currently visiting - so if you are on example.com, any cookies from example.com are first party. First party cookies can only be read by code sent from example.com.</p><p>If your browser receives instructions to store a cookie from Facebook or Youtube, those are <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies/">third</a> party cookies. First party cookies are frequently used to maintain user login state or save website specific preferences. Third party cookies can serve an additional purpose, which is to allow user’s behavior and usage across different web properties to be tracked. When you navigate to a different website, those third party cookies can be used to identify you as the user that was previously on …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>Recent posts about the state of Xorg and its future has been stirring the
internets as of late and, as almost always, it is best to stay clear of the
comments sections. The more insightful post is <a href="https://ajaxnwnk.blogspot.com/2020/10/on-abandoning-x-server.html">On Abandoning the X Server</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few details in it that should be emphasised before we move on.</p>

<div><div><pre><blockquote>Though the code happens to implement an unfortunate
specification, the code itself is quite well structured, easy to hack on, and
not far off from being easily embeddable.</blockquote></pre></div></div>

<p>From my own experiences with Xorg internals, I agree completely. A whole lot
of the code there is noticably better than corresponding paths in certain
Wayland compositors. There is more thought; domain expertise; engineering and
pure elbow grease behind it than you might have been led to believe -- if you
have only listened in to the collective moans in various discussion groups.</p>

<div><div><pre><blockquote>So is Xorg abandoned? To the extent that means using it to actually
control the display, and not just keep X apps running, I'd say yes. But xserver
is more than xfree86. Xwayland, Xwin, Xephyr, Xvnc, Xvfb: these are projects
with real value that we should not give up. A better way to say it is that we
can finally abandon xfree86.</blockquote></pre></div></div>

<p>There are some nuances here that many will miss as it requires you to know
something about the architecture of the X server. The main thing is to not
conflate ‘xfree86’ with rest of what you think of as X, hence why the blog post
separates out XFree86-the-project from 'xfree86 the hardware driver'. It is
unfortunate that the predecessor to Xorg was also called XFree86. Naming
things is hard and all that.</p>

<p>If you look at the xorg code, recommended reading for many who can
understand the language, you will see that the device-dependent code used to
drive displays (hw/ in the source tree) has a few backends, mentioned above.
Venture into the hw/xfree86 part and you will hopefully see why Adam Jackson
and others deserve the software engineering equivalent of a Purple Heart for
their service to your desktop, possibly alongside anyone that ever had to work
on ASN.1.</p>

<p>
<i>Rightfully throw Xorg-xfree86 into the fires of Mt. Doom. If you
still need Xorg-xfree86 to be your graphics card driver, you have bigger things
to worry about, such as plain old bitrot.</i></p>

<p>Is there something else? Yes. I’m not going to say <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan</a> – it is <i>very</i> likely that there
is only a small percentage of the stakeholders we would ever get along with.
That is fine. The goals and agenda reach much further than many will ever care
to travel -- unless you really want to push the boundaries of computing, or you
are actively targeted by nefarious individuals; our funding is not based on
popularity or mass adoption, but rather sticking to the shadows.</p>

<h2>The Compromise</h2>
<p>So what can we do instead? The current Wayland maintainer has
<a href="https://github.com/emersion/libliftoff">libliftoff</a> for smoothing
over the rather ‘unergonomic’ APIs that are used to get the open, modern,
graphics stack up and running. <em>Write a DDX backend that uses it.
hw/liftoff!</em></p>

<p>This will get liftoff the lift-off and mileage it needs to become good
enough for Wayland compositors to use as their default, and as a slightly more
polite migration path in order for NVIDIA to be less contemptible in the
unlikely event that they are one day struck by some capitalist version of
religious insight. Thus, it improves parts of the Wayland compositor situation
that is, politely put, chaotic.</p>

<p>Those that don’t care about what Wayland tries to achieve can stay with X and
not worry about their graphics breaking after a kernel update, or well, more
than usual -- Linux gotta Linux. NVIDIA blob users can continue down that path
and stop bothering Wayland developers, yet still run their Steam games without
submitting to open source ideals.</p>

<p>Next steps. This is for the window managers. Take libarcan-shmif-server and
embed as a module in Xorg, fork it off even. If you are unaware, this is the
IPC system part of Arcan. Both the server and the client sides of it are fairly
trivial to use and are written with developers, not toolkits, in mind.</p>

<p>It is beyond feature parity with the rest of X, but has a comparable view on
capabilities and division of responsibility. You will only get a fraction of
the benefits of Arcan as a display server, but without other dependencies or
friction - many of the problems that X clients are plagued with can be worked
around while leaving the X11 protocol and its family of extensions to rest.
Hacks relying on facilities like uinput can be put down.</p>

<p>The security around these clients will be much tighter and they can be
gradually tuned to the specification of the developer. It lets XFCE, AwesomeWM,
WindowMaker and the tens to hundreds of others WM projects to continue to
improve their respective ecosystems, specialized widgets and other tools,
rather than to burn resources they don't have to rewrite themselves with bugs
that won't be discovered or fixed in time to matter.</p>

<p>It also gives the conservative side of BSDs a portable way of improving
their use of the graphics stack without reworking fundamentals they care little
about. The OpenBSD fork 'Xenocara' can be dropped.</p>

<p>This way, the heritage is preserved and kept alive, with a band aid to live
out another decade or three. It will still work for the marginalized that have
little interest- or option- in going elsewhere. It will be less painful to
maintain and work with.</p>

<h2>The Reality</h2>
<p>Wayland only is not an option that will ever work across the board. It is
not a replacement, it is a fundamental change of principles. Stop trying to
market it as some kind of inevitable transition. There are strong differences
that will not get smoothed over regardless of how many 'protocols' you define;
<i>Wayland is Policy over Mechanism, X11 is Mechanism over Policy</i>. This is
the real barrier. Not unsubstantiated claims of 'security'. It is a tectonic
shift and no matter your feelings about that, we won't all be in the same
country or continent anymore.</p>

<p>Heralding a 'Screenshot Protocol' and similar exercises as the fix that will
bridge this gap will only serve to distract from the fact that the power of all
these little tools and hacks from the crowd of X11 users comes from the
'screenshot' being just one case of <i>'give me the contents of a specific
window and all of its children'</i> or <i>'composite these windows to an
offscreen buffer and send me the results'</i> as the building blocks
available to be creative with.

</p><p>The mechanism approach provides a huge set of possibilities and opens up for
experimentation and 'works for me' kind of hacks. The downside is that it
surrenders control on the server side and are much harder to make robust.</p>

<p>The policy aproach will only do what both sides agree to, and <i>that
	agreement has the final say</i>. If you violate this contract, you are to be
blamed. However, that contract has to be bikeshedded to near state-space
exhaustion and carefully screened for conflicts as more contracts are added to
the pile.</p>

<p>The current trajectory is Gnomelanders and Swaylanders and Kwinners and so
on continuing to lock down singular uses cases and with political gunplay try
to push that as the one solution that will convince a few more bread crumbs.
The hand that controls the toolkit will eventually just decide. <i> This will
erode the strength of the policy contract</i>.</p>

<p>This has already led to a substantial amount of dissonance -- it turns out
that the 'opting-server-side decoration protocol' in the mix had implications
for how to interpret the 'subsurface protocol' and the 'redshift gamma
protocol' will clash with whatever 'color management protocol' that materialize
and so on. To get a feel for how involved such policies become, just <a href="https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland-protocols/blob/3a74660e94d85fde24f504cc9d4375d42192e84a/stable/xdg-shell/xdg-shell.xml#L402">
read the specification</a> and you will see why no implementation arrives at
the same calculation.</p>

<p>Take the perspective of a client developer chasing after the tumbleweed of
'protocols' drifting around and try to answer 'what am I supposed to implement
and use'? To me it looked like like a Picasso painting of ill-fitting- and
internally conflicted ideas. Let this continue a few cycles more and X11 will
look clean and balanced by comparison. Someone should propose a desktop icon
protocol for the sake of it, then again, someone probably already has.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach will force Wayland to demonstrate its worth through the
virtues of its properties alone or by inventing actually compelling features
rather than by throwing shade on the elderly; or reimplementing the past
through rebranded and traced outlines from shadows cast by grander window
managers of yore.</p>

<p>The proposal leaves us with three well-defined paths.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wayland lets your own solipsist thiefdoms expand towards the horizon,
while trying to save embedded from the Android expanse.</li>
<li>People that have invested their hearts and souls into the X ecosystem can
continue to use their computers without fear of a kernel upgrade leaving them
with broken graphics, or a switch of display server paradigm leaving them with
an incompatible mental model of how system graphics work, and perhaps, one day,
stop whining about Wayland ruining their day and leave the devs alone.</li>
<li>Arcan lets you play with crazy ideas at a low initial cost. The ones
that might revolutionise your world or fail miserably. It will continue to
pushing things towards whatever is beyond the Twilight Zone in order to answer
profound questions such as 'what happens to productivity if your heartbeat
aligns with the blink rate of the cursor' (well that's actually be done since
forever and the RESULTS WOULD SHOCK YOU! - but it still illustrates the
point).</li>
</ul>

<p>It might even turn out so well that one of these paths will have a
fighting chance against the open desktop being further marginalised as a thin
client in the Azure clouded future; nothing more than a silhouette behind
unwashed Windows, a virtualized ghost of its former self.</p>

Even though card games were called leaf games back in 868AD when princess Tongchang played with them, the concept remains the same.</p>
<p>Playing card design has been used as a means of political expressions over the centuries, and represent a glimpse into political feelings of the time. Weâ€™ve compiled some of the most interesting political decks below. </p>
<h3 id="1973politicalplayingcards">1973 Political Playing Cards</h3>
<p>Released by Fournier in 1973, the deck contains humorist drawings of politicians and other kinds of leaders from the 20th century, including religious leaders, despots, dictators, presidents, and more.

<h3 id="antifascistpropaganda">Anti-Fascist Propaganda</h3>
<p>An anti-fascist card deck from 1943, designed and printed by order of Stalin with a goal of making fun of the German empire from that era.
<img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/antifacist.png"></p>
<h3 id="antinapoleon">Anti-Napoleon</h3>
<p>Most likely German-made around 1815, this deck of cards was designed and printed to portray the liberation war between Napoleon and the opposing forces.
<img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/napoleon.png"></p>
<h3 id="backtotheussr">Back to the USSR</h3>
<p>Designed and printed mainly for the Russian market back in 1995, the cards portray the most popular leaders and politicians from USSR history.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/ussr.png"></p>
<h3 id="bicyclecivilwardeck">Bicycle Civil War Deck</h3>
<p>Aimed at showing important historical characters from the American civil war era, these playing cards are relatively new and came into production in 2017. <a href="https://www.wopc.co.uk/usa/uspcc/bicycle-civil-war" rel="â€�nofollowâ€�">Check it out.</a></p>
<h3 id="cartesimperialesetroyales">Cartes Imperiales et Royales</h3>
<p>Going back to the mid-19th century, we have cards that show consorts and imperial rulers from England, Austria, France, and Russia.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/royals.png"></p>
<h3 id="churchillinww2">Churchill in WW2</h3>
<p>An entire deck dedicated to Winston Churchill in World War 2 shows him in multiple positions as an officer, politician, writer, and salesman.</p>

October 30, 2020 | https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/6-ways-mindful-ux-daily-life | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/6-ways-mindful-ux-daily-life">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-a7abb749998f8defa959"><div><p>Mindful UX protects users' mental health, privacy, and mental state. It's inclusive and accessible. It aims to prevent harm and to help recover from it.</p><h2>Managing the level of interruptions</h2><p>A product has various ways to communicate information. Visual and auditive senses are the most commonly used. Digital items sometimes use touch, for instance with haptic feedback. Some notifications require your attention immediately, for instance if your cooking timer goes off and you don't want to burn your shakshuka. Some are neither urgent nor important. Yes, airline company newsletter, I'm looking at you, especially at the moment. Finally, some don't have any fixed level of urgency or importance: you will adapt them to your contextual needs. My phone is always in silent mode, but I'll activate the ringtone if I'm expecting an important call.</p><p>We can admire Slack's fantastic workflow for notifications. (<a href="https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint/" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604080575308_6648"><div><p>In real life, how do you decide on the way you're communicating news with someone? It can depend on:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Your interlocutor (professional relation, family, long lost friend)</p></li><li><p>The number of interlocutors</p></li><li><p>The nature of the news (sensitive or not)</p></li><li><p>The urgency</p></li><li><p>The importance: paying your taxes might not be urgent if the deadline is 2 months from now, but it is important as you certainly don't want to miss it</p></li></ul><p>Based on all of that, are you going to call, email, text, video call, send a Twitter DM, leave a post-it note? Are you going to send reminders?</p><h2>Limiting distractions, protecting your attention</h2><p>We all know about this, you don't need me to spell it out: everyone is competing for our attention. You might have already taken measures to limit distractions: your phone might be in silent mode, you might even disable some notifications, block ads, disable autoplay, etc. Android and iOS even carry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17426922/apple-digital-health-vs-google-wellbeing-time-well-spent-wwdc-2018" target="_blank">native features to help us protect our attention</a>.</p><p>Apart from the digital measures I've just mentioned, there's another way you can mitigate distractions. If you share your physical work space with others - like I am doing in our current lockdown - you can signal when you're available to be interrupted and when you're not. Leave a sign on your door, place an object on your desk, etc.</p><p>There are even different levels for that:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Available</p></li><li><p>Only disturb if urgent</p></li><li><p>Do not disturb under any circumstances</p></li></ul><h2>Paying attention to accessibility</h2><p>An accessible product is a product that's usable by everyone. The quintessence of inaccessible design are Terms &amp; Conditions. Never-ending walls of text with little to no page layout, all written in legalese. For those of you who don't know, "legalese" represents legal lingo that's completely closed off to the uninitiated.</p><p>An easy way to be more mindful of accessibility in your daily life, is to adapt your communication. If you want to use jargon with people who might not be familiar with it, explain what it means - just like I did above with "legalese". In a group discussion, give background and context so that everyone has the same level of information and everyone can follow. When writing up a document, highlight the key information to make it easily scannable.</p><h2>Removing visual clutter</h2><p>We are well aware that visual overstimulation is detrimental for us. I even asked people on Twitter about it, and the results are telling.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604080575308_11640"><div><p>Whether it's in your room or at your desk, trimming down the visual clutter allows by contrast to shine more light on what's important, on the few things that you decide to leave in sight. Not only does that make it easier for you to find something you're looking for, but it's also nicer and less stressful on the eyes, because you have less visual stimuli.</p><p>The same applies to your digital places. Leaving white space and room to breathe is beneficial and so much more relaxing. Here's what my phone and laptop screens look like: much better than having files and apps filling up the space.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604080575308_30876"><div><h2>Avoiding cognitive overload</h2><p>Cognitive load refers to the mental effort we have to make to use a product, achieve a task, etc. We've all known someone who had the bad habit of starting Matryoshka sentences - or Russian dolls sentences if you prefer. "<em>I had a call with Tamara, because we have a group chat with Marie, and by the way did you know Marie and Tamara had never met? Because last time we met with Awa and had delicious ice cream, I can give you the address, and it was such a sunny day</em>" and this sentence alone tackled 6 different topics. Yes, some people talk like that, and it exhausts me because I can't follow.</p><p>Some strategies to make it easier:</p><h3>Chunking</h3><p>Do you write phone numbers as 0123456789 or 01.23.45.67.89? Splitting your content in smaller chunks makes it easier to both <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/" target="_blank">scan</a> and <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/151291/1/Thalmann.et.al.Chunking.final.pdf" target="_blank">memorise</a>.</p><h3>Reducing the number of options</h3><p>You don't have to go all the way and reduce your wardrobe to 15 items, but... I suppose that's the spirit? In UX, this is known as <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law" target="_blank">Hick's law</a>. Choosing what to have between 10 options will take longer than between 3 options. That won't stop me from having 10 different teas at home though. 😌 This isn't something to apply religiously, just to be aware of and to use whenever relevant.</p><h3><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/" target="_blank">Recognition rather than recall</a></h3><p>Yet another interesting UX principle for your daily life. Recognition leaves cues (e.g. "<em>Are mint &amp; lime in a mojito?</em>”), whereas recall doesn't ("<em>What are the main ingredients in a mojito?</em>"). The end goal of these questions is the same, but the former is easier to answer: you just have to recognise whether the information given to you is accurate.</p><p>You can then make your environment work for you. I leave my keys in the lock, so that I'm naturally prompted to take them with me as I go out, I don't need to remember it. If I want to wear something specific the next day, I'll take it out of the wardrobe and leave it in plain sight. If I need to eat something soon, as it expires the next day, I'll place it on the kitchen counter.</p><h2>Choosing between streaks or flexible goals</h2><p>Several products use streaks to entice you into practicing something daily. Headspace does it for meditation, Github does it with your code commits. Streaks can be useful, but they shouldn't be a default goal for any habit you want to learn. Aiming to be flexible, and to complete a task 3 or 5 times per week, is much more realistic than sticking to it everyday, especially if you're just getting started. Streaks create pressure to perform everyday, while more manageable goals leave room for contigencies.</p><p>Additionally, since you're more likely to complete <a href="https://nesslabs.com/flexible-consistency" target="_blank">flexible goals</a>, you can observe your own progress, which encourages you to keep going. Finally, it's important to differenciate whether your completion of a task comes from pressure or from desire. Daily streaks are more likely to be completed from internal coercion, and malleable goals from desire, because if you don't feel like doing it on Monday, it's no big deal. Listen to yourself, listen to what you feel like doing in the moment, and adapt.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why use Scala? We listed the advantages of Scala we see in our startup. See whether the benefits of Scala could help you too.</p><p>1. Focus on what matters: Expressiveness + High order functions</p><p>2. Get less bugs: Statically typed + Clean error management by design</p><p>3. Benefit from JVM ecosystem: Performant libraries + Good tooling environment</p><p>4. Attract talents</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Scala is a JVM based language. It’s flexible, you can write code in both imperative or functional styles. Scala is a pragmatic language that mixes the best of functional and object-oriented programming. It basically means that you can create classes to encapsulate state and methods but you can’t mutate them.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>The main power of Scala is to let the developers focus on what’s most important.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Expressiveness</strong></h2><p>Running on the JVM, Scala is as powerful as Java but it is way clearer and more concise. It makes the code easier (and faster) to write and read!</p><p>For example, look at how we create a list of string in Java vs Scala:</p><h4><strong>Java:</strong></h4><figure id="w-node-069225ecd5f7-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df66d44ec7c4592663ddc_20201019%20Scala%20Article_1.png" loading="lazy" alt="how we create a list of string in Java"></p></figure><h4><strong>Scala:</strong></h4><figure id="w-node-713e2fe2bca1-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df6bca2fdb8e00bb006a6_20201019%20Scala%20Article_2.png" loading="lazy" alt="how we create a list of string in Scala"></p></figure><h2><strong>High order function</strong></h2><p>High order functions are functions that abstract some control structure like a loop to update every element of an array.</p><p>They’re the functions we use most in Scala. They work by taking a function as a parameter. Used with anonymous functions, they’re perfect to focus on implementing the business logic instead of juggling with indexes to increment and stop conditions.</p><p>Look at how we can convert this list of string into a list of integers:</p><figure id="w-node-b9f12ec503cb-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df77fa26c394e0b5e18b1_20201019%20Scala%20Article_3.png" loading="lazy" alt="how to convert a list of string into a list of ints in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can also compute the sum of it by using the high-order function fold:</p><figure id="w-node-dc33ae72b25f-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df7b68e690322a1f2341e_20201019%20Scala%20Article_4.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to compute the sum by using the high-order function fold in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Statically typed</strong></h2><p>By checking the type during the compilation, Scala type system reduces considerably the amount of bugs caused by type errors.</p><p>Type inference allows typing without being too verbose:</p><p>def square(x: Int) = x * x&nbsp;</p><p>Here the type of square (Int) is inferred from the * operator which multiplies an Int by an Int giving an Int in output.</p><p>And thanks to pattern matching, we can still write flexible code:</p><figure id="w-node-5d4c922f320c-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df82d19cead6575ed2edd_20201019%20Scala%20Article_5.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to decompose an object to pattern match on its attributes, add pattern guards, pattern match a regex or the elements of a List in Scala"></p></figure><p>Here we can even decompose an object to pattern match on its attributes. We can even add pattern guards (if condition in a case), pattern match a regex or the elements of a List.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Clean error management by design</strong></h2><h3><strong>Option and Either</strong></h3><p>There are some useful standard types in Scala to manage errors. The most commonly used are Option and Either. An Option can either be a class Some containing a value or a None object. So we can associate a valid result to Some and an error to None. Let's write a function to safely update a String to Int.</p><figure id="w-node-60c03b54f3c2-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df92687207e98effd9699_20201019%20Scala%20Article_6.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to to safely update a String to Int in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>And if we need an error message we can use the Either class that will return a Right containing the value or a Left with an error type.</p><figure id="w-node-b021a222808e-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8dfb98068c68637d53699d_20201019%20Scala%20Article_7.png" loading="lazy" alt="If we need an error message we can use the Either class that will return a Right containing the value or a Left with an error type in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Try is also a great type to manage error, especially to encapsulate every call to Java functions that can throw errors.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Combine them with for-comprehension</strong></h3><p>Option, Either or Try allow us to return a result or an error and not throw it to whatever will catch it. And thanks to a special Scala control structure, the “for-comprehension”, we can easily combine them to return the first error encountered.</p><figure id="w-node-c336c52f22b2-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df9f519cead4e10ed589d_20201019%20Scala%20Article_8.png" loading="lazy" alt="The Scala control structure “for-comprehension” allows to easily combine Option, Either and Try to return the first error encountered."></p></figure><p>dividend on the left part of dividend &lt;- convertStringToInt(dividendStr) is the value in the Right of the convertStringToInt(dividendStr) result. If convertStringToInt(dividendStr) returns an error, it will stop immediately and return that error in a Left for safeStringDivision.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Perfect to handle asynchronous code</strong></h3><p>“for-comprehension” are also amazing to work with asynchronous code like HTTP calls encapsulated in a Future. We can combine them and return an error for the first error we encounter.</p><figure id="w-node-6dcad4d139cc-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8dfab1a0c47639e33ad40f_20201019%20Scala%20Article_9.png" loading="lazy" alt="In Scala, for-comprehension are also amazing to work with asynchronous code like HTTP calls encapsulate in a Future."></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can even combine Future with other error types like Either by using functional libraries like <a href="https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/eithert.html" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>JVM allows to use powerful java libraries</strong></h2><p>For example we use db connectors, libraries to manage timestamps, logging &amp; monitoring clients and more!</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Good tooling environment</strong></h2><p>There is a great IDE with Intellij Idea.

Over the next decade and beyond, we see this market evolving and enabling the emergence of multiple billion dollar startups that build upon Adobe’s foundation. These include several companies already well on their way such as Canva, Figma, and others. </p><p>In this article, we: i) introduce a framework for evaluating Adobe as a platform company; ii) analyze Adobe’s history and the factors that enabled its rise, iii) describe the technology &amp; behavioral waves catalyzing innovation, and iv) suggest areas of opportunity for emerging startups. More specifically, we highlight video workflows, analytics capabilities, and document alternatives as 3 key areas of opportunity, and also link a growing <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invL8RfK15a1yqHG1&amp;inviteToken=752ceb35a51bae83e02f6f454798d979e147d6f162b3bb3ad10ca0bc0b95a15c">repository</a> of startups in various creative software categories. Please feel free to read the entire article, or skip to the section(s) that are most interesting to you.</p><hr><h2>I. Introduction</h2><hr><p>Over the past few years, much attention has been paid to the “unbundling” of companies including eBay, Craigslist, and Linkedin. The basis of the unbundling concept is that while the aggregation of multiple products and services initially results in network effects and scale economies in the first wave of a technology market, it also limits personalization, customization, and quality of experience. This creates an opportunity for new startups to displace the incumbent by providing more customized solutions as the market matures.</p><p>While the unbundling approach has worked well for startups attacking certain incumbents, it has limitations as a framework. This is particularly true for platform companies upon which new startups rely on in order to successfully build and distribute products. In these markets, innovation takes a more layered approach, with newer companies building upon a foundation laid by an incumbent. Rather than unbundling, we call this <em>an evolution</em> of a platform, and we believe that this is the best framework for evaluating Adobe, its innovation track record, and the startups innovating in this market today. </p><p>In comparison to better-known software giants in Silicon Valley, Adobe has flourished relatively quietly for much of its 38-year history. What began as a small publishing software company has now expanded into a conglomerate providing an extensive suite of products across its Creative, Document, and Experience Clouds. Today, Adobe employs over 22,000 employees and generates over $11 billion in revenue annually, with a market capitalization of ~$245 billion. <a href="">1</a></p><p>Along the way, it has made numerous transformative acquisitions, including Macromedia ($3.4 billion), Omniture ($1.8 billion), and Marketo ($4.8 billion). Its acquisition of Behance ($150 million) also enabled it to build the leading online platform to showcase and discover creative work. It has also successfully expanded into new pockets of creative software, which eventually yielded large business lines. Adobe’s ability to consistently innovate through organic and inorganic growth, while successfully transitioning leadership between different CEOs over multiple decades, is one of the tech industry’s great overlooked stories. The company’s Creative Cloud launch and move to a subscription-based pricing model at the end of 2013 precipitated a quadrupling of its market cap since that time. <a href="">2</a></p><p><img alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 12.09.42 PM" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/clfay1lxzjey/7nSKcMyD30evkeX4plmIQa/b0fb3bc9358b4724e76df9b2ae2b20bc/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_12.09.42_PM.png"></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>Adobe’s Stock Price Has Skyrocketed over the Past Two Decades</em></strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>As we explain below, we believe Adobe is entering a new phase, where new startups are building upon its platform and legacy. The growth of this new generation of startups is driven by technological and behavioral inflections. Rather than replace Adobe’s products, these startups are innovating  upon Adobe’s foundation to build a new generation of creative software. </p><hr><h2>II. The Growth of Adobe and its Significance</h2><hr><p>Adobe was founded by Chuck Geschke and John Warnock (above) to enable more accessible publishing and printing software.Throughout its first decade, Adobe aggressively targeted designers and creative professionals, creating new categories of software across graphics, photo, video, and publishing. Along with Apple, Adobe helped bring about the desktop publishing revolution, launching products such as Illustrator, Photoshop, and Acrobat. Over the past two decades, Adobe then made several transformative acquisitions, enabling it to expand into web-based products (Macromedia), enterprise analytics (Omniture), e-commerce software (Magento), and marketing automation software (Marketo). </p><p>We believe that Adobe’s success has been driven largely by the following three characteristics:</p><p>1) <strong>Successful Partnerships:</strong> From the very beginning, Adobe has secured successful partnerships through a thoughtful and strategic approach to choosing the right partners. Adobe’s first product, PostScript, was a page description language, which allowed users to print to external printers. Adobe understood that the proliferation of its software was dependent on high-quality hardware, and it strategically chose to partner with the best hardware company for creative users, Apple. In 1985, Apple debuted the LaserWriter printer with Postscript, and it was the first printer to use the language. Combined with a third partnership with Aldus Software, the trio established the desktop publishing revolution, and elevated Adobe’s positioning within the corporate ecosystem. Taking this further, Adobe capitalized on this position and cultivated deep partnerships with other large technology companies, such as IBM and Microsoft, ensuring it is deeply entrenched as the defacto creative software suite. </p><p>2) <strong>Ability to Bundle Products:</strong> Adobe has consistently been able to bundle its products into an integrated suite, while ensuring that value was strong enough for customers to pay a premium price for the bundle. In its early years, Adobe quickly amassed a wide variety of capabilities and was able to bundle new offerings with existing products to accelerate adoption. The company understood that the customer of that time wasn’t seeking point solutions, and instead wanted an integrated software solution that could solve multiple needs. Adobe has built on this strategy over time, culminating in the launch of its full product suite in 2003. What has been most unique about Adobe’s bundling approach is its ability to charge premium prices for the full subscription offering. For example, Adobe’s Creative Cloud offering is currently $80 per month for the base business license, or almost $1k per year. Adobe has an estimated 15 million paying subscribers today, evidencing the power of its integrated suite and the fact that Adobe is the standard. The network effects of Adobe’s products also enhance its lock-in. </p><p>3) <strong>Successful Acquisitions:</strong> Throughout its tenure, Adobe strategically selected acquisitions to enter into new markets, often choosing to buy versus build, and then subsequently successfully integrated those acquisitions. Adobe’s acquisition strategy is differentiated due to the fact that the company is not afraid to make large, bold bets, at same time dedicating the time and resources over a long period to ensure that these bets pay off. For example, Adobe’s $1.8 billion acquisition of Omniture in 2009 was seemingly off strategy and non-complementary. Why was a creative/design software company making such a large bet to acquire the leading player in enterprise analytics? Adobe understood that the future of marketing was uniting content creation with marketing analytics. Disciplines that were historically the purview of different enterprise departments would merge, and the rise of web/mobile analytics would enable a much tighter feedback loop within content creation and design. More than ten years later, the deal is seen as a brilliant strategic move that enabled Adobe to build its Experience Cloud.</p><p><img alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 12.14.59 PM" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/clfay1lxzjey/4E8RcynEAKHogL4YZDJccI/ebebfd21f11b47ddbe794c2778afa757/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_12.14.59_PM.png"></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>Adobe Has Made Several Successful Acquisitions over the Past Two Decades</em></strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>4) <strong>Transition to Cloud-based Company:</strong> In 2012, Adobe released Creative Cloud and fundamentally changed the way its products were offered, updated, and priced. While risky at the time, it enabled Adobe to transform the types of users they targeted and more importantly, stay relevant as more cloud-based competitors emerged. Growth in subscriptions for the Creative Cloud over the two years following launch can be seen below.</p><p><img alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 12.17.42 PM" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/clfay1lxzjey/16qjRVLN4x3x0fpmLeZHeB/18dbd03bacb9f8e0bbdfd8937dbbbd01/updated_chart.jpg"></p><p>How did Adobe accomplish its transition to becoming a cloud company, and why did they succeed where many large companies have stumbled? They succeeded through a series of strategic moves led by CEO Shantanu Narayen. These included the acquisition of Omniture, which enabled Adobe to immediately become the leader in enterprise cloud analytics. It also included the $150m acquisition of Behance, which provided the company with a large community of designers who desired to showcase creative work. By 2018, Behance had over 10 million users, 10x the number when it was acquired by Adobe.</p><p>Adobe was also willing to absorb the financial impact of switching from a one-time license of ~$1800 to a per-month subscription of $50 for its Creative Cloud software, which results in an initial revenue shortfall. Adobe did this over five years, first introducing Creative Cloud in April 2012, and not retiring its license option until January 2017.</p><p>Finally, Adobe displayed pragmatism in listening to the market where its products were not well-received. By far the most notable example was Adobe Flash. In 2010, Steve Jobs posted his letter “Thoughts on Flash,” which criticized Flash and stated why Flash would not be allowed on iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. While Adobe’s CEO Narayen initially fired back at Jobs, Adobe eventually decided to discontinue Flash and focus resources on HTML5. Through this move, Adobe displayed pragmatism, realizing that there was more money in building and acquiring SaaS apps than supporting media software on hardware …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post dives deep into a scary data loss scenario - we'll cover identifying the data loss, investigating the root cause, and finally recovering the data.</p>
<p><strong>This bug affected Readwise users who exported their highlights (both manually &amp; automatically) to Roam on 10/27. If you are one of those users, you should contact Roam support &amp; use <a href="https://github.com/jchen1/roam-restore" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">my recovery code</a> ASAP!</strong></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Roam</a> is a "note-taking tool for networked thought". It supports all sorts of cool things - what's relevant here is that it automatically creates a new page for every day, your Daily Notes. Recently, I started using <a href="https://readwise.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Readwise</a>, which ingests Kindle highlights and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spaced repetition</a> to help you remember what you read. Readwise has a Roam integration, which automatically adds Kindle highlights to Roam. Unfortunately, since Roam doesn't have a public API yet, Readwise's integration seems to be effectively using Selenium - clicking on elements and pasting highlights which is inherently flaky.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I woke up without my Daily Notes from the day before. Disaster! Fortunately, with the help of the Roam Slack group and Tristan from Readwise, I was able to isolate the cause of note deletion and even restore my lost data. Here's what happened:</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Roam architecture</h2>
<p>Roam uses <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datascript</a> for its client-side database. Like Datomic, Datascript stores data as a <code>datom</code>, defined as <code>[e a v tx]</code>, or <code>entity</code>, <code>attribute</code>, <code>value</code>, and <code>transaction-id</code> (incrementing integer). If you're interested in learning more, <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/datascript-internals/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datascript's author has an excellent overview</a>.</p>
<p>Importantly for us, Roam differs from other webapps in that it doesn't store all state and history in its backend. Instead, Roam's backend just stores a snapshotted Datascript database (updated ~daily as far as I can tell) and the list of transactions since that last snapshot. If we can download those two things before Roam's next snapshot, we have two breadcrumbs towards recovery: 1. We can find the transaction that deleted my Daily Notes page 2. We can also reconstruct our Datascript database, replaying transactions up until the point of deletion, and recover our Daily Notes from that!</p>
<h2>Capturing state</h2>
<p>Our first step is to store Roam's database snapshot and transaction list. Instead of REST API calls, Roam uses a Websocket connection to send these to its web client. This complicates things for us: instead of just saving API responses with <code>curl</code>, we need to download a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_%28file_format%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HAR file</a>, which, fortunately for us, includes Websocket traffic with more recent Chrome versions. HAR files are just JSON archives stored in chronological order - it's easy to select just the Websocket traffic:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-har
  [harfile]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [json (<span>json/parse-string</span> (<span><span>slurp</span></span> harfile) <span>true</span>)
        ws-messages (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> json <span>:log</span> <span>:entries</span> (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some?</span> (<span>:_webSocketMessages</span> %))) second <span>:_webSocketMessages</span>)
        ws-data (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:data</span> ws-messages)]
    ws-data))</code></pre>
<p>Inspecting this data more closely, it appears that Roam's websocket messages are generally JSON strings (and occasionally numbers). When a message is more than 16KB, it's split into multiple messages without wrapping - so we'll need to stitch these bigger messages together. One way to detect a non-split-message is to just try and parse it as JSON - if it's valid, we can say it's non-split. (There's an edge case we're unlikely to hit here: if the 16KB chunk just so happens to be valid JSON as well we'll be out of luck. Lucky for us, I didn't run into this!) Now, we can extend <code>parse-har</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-har
  [harfile]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [json (<span>json/parse-string</span> (<span><span>slurp</span></span> harfile) <span>true</span>)
        ws-messages (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> json <span>:log</span> <span>:entries</span> (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some?</span> (<span>:_webSocketMessages</span> %))) second <span>:_webSocketMessages</span>)
        ws-data (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:data</span> ws-messages)
        try-parse #(<span><span>try</span></span> (<span>json/parse-string</span> % <span>true</span>)
                        (<span>catch</span> Throwable _ <span>nil</span>))
        
        
        
        ws-json (<span><span>reduce</span></span> (<span><span>fn</span></span> [{<span>:keys</span> [done partial]} next]
                          (<span><span>let</span></span> [potential-json-str (<span><span>str</span></span> partial next)]
                            (<span><span>if-let</span></span> [json (<span>try-parse</span> potential-json-str)]
                              {<span>:done</span> (<span><span>conj</span></span> done json)
                               <span>:partial</span> <span>""</span>}
                              {<span>:done</span> done
                               <span>:partial</span> potential-json-str})))
                        {<span>:done</span> [] <span>:partial</span> <span>""</span>}
                        ws-data)]
    (<span><span>assert</span></span> (<span><span>=</span></span> (<span>:partial</span> ws-json) <span>""</span>))
    (<span>:done</span> ws-json)))</code></pre>
<h2>Finding the culprit</h2>
<p>Armed with our parsed websocket messages, we can see that many of them look like transactions. One that looks particularly suspicious has a nested field named <code>tx-meta</code> with the value <code>delete-page</code>! The transaction looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{<span>:app-version</span> <span>"0.7.4"</span>,
 <span>:email</span> <span>"hello@jeff.yt"</span>,
 <span>:session-id</span> <span>"uuid95d98efd-c8fa-4412-87a4-e7b7201bee24"</span>,
 <span>:t</span> <span>1603947791561</span>,
 <span>:time</span> <span>1603947791542</span>,
 <span>:tx</span> <span>"[[\"^ \",\"~:block/uid\",\"ogCRjInhE\",\"~:block/string\",\"some-text-here\",\"~:edit/time\",1603947791363,\"~:edit/email\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"^ \",\"^0\",\"4CpSytRnt\",\"^1\",\"Highlights first synced by #Readwise October 28th, 2020\",\"^2\",1603947791364,\"^3\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"^ \",\"^0\",\"C-IOsE50G\",\"^1\",\"New highlights added October 28th, 2020 at 11:03 PM\",\"^2\",1603947791364,\"^3\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"~:db.fn/retractEntity\",[\"^0\",\"hLBqaz4gS\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"vwD08rqdT\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"6VWOGgeAd\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"P56-fWN2O\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"SffV3NfN2\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"qnZBZCGCv\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"10-28-2020\"]]]"</span>,
 <span>:tx-meta</span> {<span>:event-id</span> <span>"uuid719b009f-b969-47b6-b2db-41542d10b328"</span>,
           <span>:event-name</span> <span>"delete-page"</span>,
           <span>:tx-id</span> <span>"uuid289e80fc-4c27-4d54-9df4-d83ac0ceeaed"</span>,
           <span>:tx-name</span> <span>"delete-page"</span>}}</code></pre>
<p>I omitted ~90% of the transaction to save space - but it's more of the same. This definitely looks like the transaction that deleted my Daily Notes page: I see <code>db.fn/retractEntity</code> as well as <code>10-28-2020</code> in the transaction. Interestingly, this transaction captures two Readwise interactions as well. It's not a smoking gun, but it's definitely suspicious that Readwise was operating on my database at the <strong>exact same time</strong> that my page was mysteriously deleted!</p>
<p>Let's pause here, and check in with the Roam Slack group. Someone else has already started a thread about data loss! They and others quickly confirm that they also all have Readwise's auto-export enabled. Again, it's not confirmation that Readwise is to blame, but it's enough for me to stop what I'm doing and disable my Readwise integration! We'll also share our knowledge in the Slack thread and ask affected users to save their Roam HAR file like we did.</p>
<p>Later, <a href="https://twitter.com/homsiT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tristan, founder of Readwise</a>, pops into Slack and quickly confirms that <a href="https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1321856588022513665" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a recent Roam behavior change combined with the Readwise integration can cause deleted pages</a>. Huge props to Tristan who responds perfectly: he triages the issue, disables the feature to prevent any more users from hitting it, and fixes &amp; re-enables auto-export all within a couple hours! Tristan also remains communicative and takes full responsibility, even offering refunds, though I'd argue that these hiccups are bound to happen when Roam still hasn't opened up their public API.</p>
<h2>Deserializing the database</h2>
<p>Peeking again at our parsed HAR file, we see what appears to be our serialized database - it's stored like this:</p>
<pre><code>{<span>:split-db</span> {<span>0</span> <span>"transit-encoded-str-0"</span>
            <span>1</span> <span>"transit-encoded-str-1"</span>
            ...}}</code></pre>
<p>Each string looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^H\\\",\\\"zeciaTJfg\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^17\\\",\\\"hello@jeff.yt\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^18\\\",1583270770601,536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^R\\\",\\\"hello@jeff.yt\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^S\\\",1583270784121,536877377]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1642,\\\"^E\\\",1643,536877384]]
</code></pre>
<p>This looks like Transit! <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Transit</a> is a JSON-like format for sending data between applications (<a href="https://blog.klipse.tech/clojure/2016/09/22/transit-clojure.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this post</a> is a good introduction). Datascript has its own <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript-transit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">set of Transit handlers</a> - let's import that and see if we get a working database! Of course, we'll also need to combine <code>split-db</code> by smashing the Transit-encoded strings together.</p>
<pre><code>(<span>require</span> '[datascript.transit <span>:as</span> dt])

(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-db
  [parsed-har]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [db-str (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> parsed-har
                    
                    (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some-&gt;</span> % <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span> <span>:split-db</span>))
                    first <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span> <span>:split-db</span>
                    vals
                    (<span>string/join</span> <span>""</span>))]
    (<span>dt/read-transit-str</span> db-str)))</code></pre>
<p>Voila - a real Datascript database! We can confirm it's my Roam database by querying it:</p>
<pre><code>(<span>require</span> '[datascript.core <span>:as</span> d])

<p>With a working Roam database, our next step is to apply all of the transactions we have up until the deletion event. Transactions are Transit-encoded, and we'll have to do quite a bit of data manipulation to get a list of them. Once we have that list, we can sort the transactions and apply them sequentially:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> apply-transactions-until
  [db parsed-har until-time]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [transactions-to-apply (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> parsed-har

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Bill Walsh is one of the greatest coaches in the history of the NFL. He
started with a 49ers team that only won two games and within two years they
had won their first Super Bowl. He retired after 10 years but before he was
done they would win two more. A decade later more than half of the head
coaches in the NFL had once served on his staff.</p>
<p>Just before he passed away he wrote a book on leadership entitled “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Score-Takes-Care-Itself-Philosophy/dp/1591843472/">The Score
Takes Care of
Itself</a>.”
His idea was simple enough: you don’t win football games by trying to score.
You don’t build championship teams by trying to win.  Instead he set a high
standard of performance and held people to it on the execution of every play.
He believed there were good losses and bad wins. He believed that if you had
good people, a good culture, and strong guiding principles then the score
would take care of itself.</p>
<p>If you go back to 2012 there are some analogies one could draw between the
49ers of that era and the performance of Facebook ads. I don’t know if we even
had two wins before 2012. But after? Well, they don’t give out Lombardi
trophies for digital advertising but I think if they did we’d be a contender.</p>
<p>The far more interesting connection between these stories is the approach. We
didn’t establish ourselves as a leading digital advertising platform by
focusing on the obvious metric of revenue. We realized that when it came to
revenue there were good losses and bad wins. We explicitly focused on
advertiser value and consumer value even when it came at the cost of revenue.
This wasn’t just cultural; our ranking systems and auction focus on optimizing
advertiser value and consumer experience rather than revenue to Facebook. By
focusing on our people, on our culture, and on strong guiding principles we
have been able to demonstrate that the revenue takes care of itself.</p>
<p>Focusing on metrics has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">well established
problems</a>, but in the case of
revenue there are two even more pathological ones.</p>
<p>Revenue is a trailing indicator. When people are just getting started with a
new service they don’t just dive in with their full budget. They invest a
little and revise their budget allocation incrementally. If you push too hard
on revenue you can get 100% of the budget they allocated you today but you are
missing the bigger opportunity to give them outsized returns which is what
will cause them to allocate you more of their budget in the future.</p>
<p>Revenue is short term. In many of our products a focus on maximizing revenue
would lead us down a very different path than maximizing value. Maximizing
value often requires long term investments whose return profile is risky or
entirely unknown. But we know that without those types of long term
investments our business growth will start to plateau as we saturate the value
created by existing solutions.</p>
<p>Mark had a famous line in the S-1 we filed for our IPO: “We don’t build
products to make money, we make money to build great products.” I agree
wholeheartedly which is why the mission of the Facebook ads organization isn’t
to make money. It is to make meaningful connections between people and
businesses. And we take that seriously.</p></section></div></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://carlschwan.eu/2020/10/30/kde-org-hugo.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carlschwan.eu/2020/10/30/kde-org-hugo.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img src="https://carlschwan.eu/assets/img/heading_hugo.png" alt="Screenshot KDE.org"></p>

<p><a href="https://kde.org/">KDE.org</a> now uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Hugo is a fast and modern static site
generator written in Go. It provides a few improvements over the old system that was
using plain PHP. A large part of the work was done by Anuj during GSoC 2020. This
was a massive work, converting the repository storing more than 20 years of KDE
history.</p>

<p>The website is now generated once and no longer uses PHP to generate itself at runtime.
This improves the loading speed of the website, but the speed boost is not significant,
since the PHP code used before was quite small and KDE’s servers are powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest improvement is in terms of features. We are now working with markdown
files instead of raw HTML files, this makes the life of the promo team much easier.</p>

<p>The internationalization of the website now creates a unique URL per language, this
should allow Google to link to the version of the website using the correct language.
A <a href="https://kde.org/fr/">French</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/uk/">Ukrainian</a>,
<a href="https://kde.org/ca/">Catalan</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/nl/">Dutch</a>, and a few more languages
are already available. There is also a proper language selector! We also don’t need
to manually tag each string for translations.</p>

<p>There is also now an <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/index.xml">RSS feed</a> with all the
latest announcements. Another big improvement is that the announcements list is
autogenerated and no longer modified by hand and with the help of the release scripts.</p>

<p>Another nice change for website developers is that now the SCSS code for the individual
pages is located in the kde-org repository itself instead of another repository.
Overall the developer experience is much better, there is no need to set up an apache
server and to the PHP configs to include the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/websites/capacity">capacity framework</a>, just to get the
website running locally. Now you only need to download the Hugo binary from their
release page and run it on the repo.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-and-gettext">Hugo and Gettext</h2>

<p>The internationalization of KDE.org was quite a challenge. When working on a multilingual
website with Hugo, Hugo expects a markdown document per language for each translated
page.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plasma-desktop.md
plasma-desktop.es.md
plasma-desktop.fr.md
plasma-desktop.uk.md
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that traditional translations workflow rely on a string-based approach,
where a document is split in paragraphs and translated individually. So I couldn’t
just put each file markdown file as big blobs in the po files. To solve this problem,
I created a python script splitting the markdown files in paragraphs, simplifying
the markdown syntax (removing leading <code>#</code> and <code>+</code> for heading and list item). This
script also handles Hugo shortcodes transforming:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; img caption="My figure caption" alt="My accessible description" src="..." &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in two strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My figure caption</li>
  <li>My accessible description</li>
</ul>

<p>The script can obliviously put the individual strings back in place. The scripts also
handle the menu translation, and the translations of the strings in the footers.
For now, the script is just a file in the kde-org repository, but I would like to
transform it to a standalone library so that other gettext and Hugo users can
translate their website.</p>

<p>Using Hugo API, the language selector was trivial to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
&lt;ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto"&gt;
  {{ if .IsTranslated }}
    &lt;li class="nav-item dropdown" aria-describedby="language-picker-description"&gt;
      &lt;p class="sr-only" id="language-picker-description"&gt;{{ i18n "Select-your-language" }}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/Language-Icons/icon20x24px-exported-transparent.png" alt="" /&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;{{ i18n "translations" }}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;div class="dropdown-menu dropdonw-trans" role="listbox"&gt;
        &lt;a class="dropdown-item" aria-selected="true" hreflang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Site.Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ range .Translations }}
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" hreflang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ end }}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a bit verbose because this selector is also fully accessible for screen readers.</p>

<p>There are a few more tricks employed in kde.org to improve the internationalization, for
example when a page doesn’t exist in a language, there is an Apache rule redirecting it
to the English version. Another nice trick is that there is a special Hugo shortcode
called <code>i18n_var</code> and used to parametrize the strings. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; i18n_var "Today KDE releases a bugfix update to KDE Plasma 5, versioned %[1]s" "5.20.2" &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the extractor is clever and only extract the part that needs to be translated.</p>

The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A while ago,
<a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/monorepo_vcs.html">I pondered monorepo version control systems</a>.
This article is at the opposite end of the spectrum: Manyrepos.</p>
<h2>Why Manyrepo?</h2>
<p>Monorepos are alluring since Google, Facebook, and Microsoft use that approach.
Is that a part of their secret sauce or accidental?
There is another big tech company which does the opposite.
At Amazon, teams work more independently.
Some use different version control systems which are not git
like Subversion and Perforce.
I guess that most companies do <em>not</em> have a monorepo
because it is really easy to split of a separate project
but hard to merge them just from an organizational point of view.
So maybe we can learn more from Amazon than Google?</p>
<p>A common pattern is that Amazon like the others built its own infrastructure
and engineers love it and miss it after they leave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've heard descriptions and seen blog entries about many other large companies build systems, but to be honest, nothing even comes close to the amazing technology Amazon has produced.
I would probably argue that what Google, Facebook, and most other companies of comparable size and larger do is at best objectively less good and at worst wasting millions of dollars of lost productivity.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">terabyte</a></p>
<p>Once you understand the build and deployment tools you first wonder how you ever did anything before and then start to fear how you'll do anything once you leave.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">hohle</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like Ex-Googlers reinvented their build system on the outside
with <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs">Pants</a>
and <a href="https://buck.build/">Buck</a>.
Likewise <a href="https://qbtbuildtool.com/">QBT</a> reinvents the Amazon build system.
Unfortunately, QBT is less known and less mature.</p>
<h2>Amazon's Build System</h2>
<p>There is less information about Amazon unfortunately.
Mine is from <a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">this gist</a>
and discussions on 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24722214">HN</a> and
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system">lobste.rs</a>.
If I got something wrong, please tell me.
The short version is that Amazon's "Brazil" tool is
more of a package system than a build system.
It is closer to Nix than to Bazel.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">Brazil delegates the actual build process to language-specific tools</a>.
Tools, like tmux, are also packaged with Brazil.
The interesting part is how packages are managed
and the core concept to understand is <em>version set</em>.</p>
<p>If you create a package at Amazon,
you specify an <em>interface version</em> like "1.1".
As long as changes are backwards-compatible,
the interface version is not changed.
When Brazil builds a package,
it appends an additional number to turn it into a <em>build version</em>
like "1.1.3847523".
You can only specify dependencies on interface versions.</p>
<p>Another thing Brazil does when building a package
is to record the transitive closure of dependencies
with their build versions.
Modern packaging tools differ between
"dependencies you want"
and "dependencies you actually used".
For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html">Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock in Rust</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>version set</em> is a collection of packages.
The "live" package is the special global one
which corresponds to a trunk branch in version control.
When you build a package "against" a version set,
the tests of all packages in the version set are executed,
and the version set is incremented.
Thus the individual package is updated
(or published if it was not part of the version set before).</p>
<p>Brazil dependencies are classified as runtime, build, and test dependencies.
So for deployment, it can strip everything but the runtime dependencies
from a version set.</p>
<p>Dependencies must be carefully managed in this environment
as a "dependency hell" scenario is possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest ways that brazil was misused was around handling of major versions [aka interface version].
For context, only a single major version of a package is allowed to exist in a versionset at a time. If you tried to merge in a different major version of a package into your versionset, your pipeline would fail to build due to "Major version conflicts". One of the biggest sins was around bumping the major versions of the dependencies in a library without bumping the major version of that library at the same time. This would lead to many broken pipelines. Let's say you have a library Foo-1.0 with a bunch of users on other teams. You decide to bump up the Guava version from 25 to 29 and publish the new version of Foo-1.0. Anyone consuming Foo-1.0 would automatically pick up the new version of that lib because it's just a minor version change, however the merge would fail with a "major version conflict" because the major version of Guava they're using in their versionset is still 25. This means you would either have to pin that library back at a previous version, or bump your dependency on Guava in all of you packages to 29.
–<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24731537">pentlander</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an insight that generalizes:
Updating a dependency major version is a breaking change
even if your API is stable.</p>
<h2>The Point?</h2>
<p>Overall, it sounds a lot like a distribution package manager like apt or Nix.
The difference of version sets is
that they provide a branching mechanism
and this is how teams can work independently.
How is that unique though?
You can fork with apt and Nix as well.
In a monorepo, it would be a branch.
It must be about something different.</p>
<p>One advantage of monorepos is that one can track all users.
Version sets in Brazil provide a similar mechanism
since it is a <em>central</em> database.
This is important in case of security updates, for example.
Unfortunately, in manyrepo environments this information is usually not available
and when an issue arise it must be arduously researched.
So maybe companies should build such infrastructure
instead of dreaming about monorepos?</p>
<p>Coming back to the advantage of manyrepos,
refering to Amazon we can describe it concretely:
Version sets allow you to use multiple interface versions of the same package
at once (not multiple build versions though).
This mixture is not technically possible with a git monorepo
(but with Subversion or Perforce).
This is at least one example of the general tradeoff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t really think there’s a better or worse between the Amazon and Google/FB style build/deploy/source control systems, it’s primarily a reflection of the org/team structure and what they prioritize - there’s tension between team independence/velocity and crosscutting changes that optimize the whole codebase.
–<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system#c_fzyzg6">revert</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more discussion online about this.
Many companies should value the team independence over the crosscutting changes.
So the question is:
How to get the advantages we currently uniquely attribute to monorepos
in a manyrepo setting?
Amazon's Brazil has valuable ideas to contribute
and should be more widely known.</p>

October 30, 2020 | https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I was a power user of <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for many years, so I had mixed
feelings recently about <a href="https://archive.is/zpx2r">their decision</a> to change
their pricing model. Under IFTTT's new pricing, you can only have 3 “custom”
actions created/enabled at any time – which is quite a downgrade from the
current unlimited free plan. On the one hand, I'm glad to see IFTTT take
necessary steps to ensure it has long-term financial stability, but on the other
hand, I don't personally get enough value from their service anymore to justify
a recurring cost. (The plan will likely be
$4/month<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but if you sign up before a deadline, you
can lock in a price as low as $2/month)</p>
<p>IFTTT was an awesome and uniquely easy-to-use service when it first came out,
but now there are better options for personal automation for people like me, who
like to tinker with this sort of thing. Systems like
<a href="https://nodered.org/">node-red</a> and iOS shortcuts can be self hosted or run on
device, and they provide more sophisticated logic for workflows than IFTTT.</p>
<p>I stayed on IFTTT this long mostly due to inertia, and it's fantastically long
list of supported services. If I needed to throw together a quick
spreadsheet-recording automation, or cron-like trigger, IFTTT was a great
starting place. However, it does have limitations. Until now (though it seems
like this might change with their premium offering), IFTTT basically only did
what its name implied: “if this, then that”. No “if X then Y else Z”, no “if X
and Z then Y”, etc. Often times, you don't need any complicated logic or
filtering, but it was frustrating that there wasn't the option for more advanced
automation. Ultimately, IFTTT had a great “on-ramp”, but once you were on board
with their system, you realize how shallow it is. Excellent breadth, mediocre
depth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the past couple years IFTTT's UI has leaned heavily into the
“applet” metaphor, with these big goofy toggle switches to enable/disable
automations. The site also transitioned towards a focus on community- (or, more
often corporate-) created automations, at the expense of the experience for
creating your own applets. Like seriously, why is 30% of the UI for an applet
<em>details page</em> (!) taken up by the connection status toggle?</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>The settings page, too, is woefully information sparse. As a user, this makes me
feel that desktop-usability was not high on IFTTT's design priorities. You have
to scroll the page to begin to start to see what the automation is doing:</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings.png">
        
            
                
                
            
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings_hub4acc09d90c5c0c4cbf3054a07fa3040_91989_0x400_resize_lanczos_2.png" loading="lazy"> 
        </a>
</figure>

<p>Eventually, the UI got to the point where it felt like using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Duplo">Duplos</a> or something. It didn't have
to be this way! There are great low-to-no-code tools that have much more usable
interfaces, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a>.</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png">
        
            
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png" loading="lazy"> 
        </a>
</figure>

<p>So, I decided to migrate away, since the move to premium was already going to
substantially limit what I could do with IFTTT. In going through my catalog of
IFTTT “applets”, I identified 3 main patterns of automations that I used IFTTT
for: (1) triggering an action to happen at a specific time, (2) triggering an
action to happen in response to a location change (i.e. geofencing), or (3)
triggering an action to happen in response to an event in a web service.</p>
<p>Of these 3 buckets, iOS shortcuts readily handles the first 2: as of iOS 14,
Shortcuts can be triggered in the background at a specific time of day, or in
response to entering/leaving a geofence. Shortcuts also has a much more
sophisticated integration with iOS than any of IFTTT's apps, so more exciting
mobile automation becomes possible – for example, setting my phone to Low Power
Mode once the battery drops below a certain threshold. Of course, you are
restricted to apps/services that support Shortcuts, and the number of supported
services is considerably smaller than IFTTT.</p>
<p>Node-red handles buckets 1 and 3: it has good support for time-based actions,
and can receive webhooks to respond to events from external services. It also
has a great plugin ecosystem, so it's support begins to rival IFTTT's impressive
selection of supported services. Additionally, node-red has many “escape
hatches” that IFTTT does not: you can use it to make raw HTTP requests and write
your own plugins/logic in Javascript, allowing for much more complex automation.</p>
<p>Neither node-red nor iOS shortcuts are as easy to use as IFTTT for putting
together a simple automation, which is a shame. However, between them (and other
alternative automation frameworks that I've trialed, like <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/huginn/huginn">huginn</a>), I've more than covered my
personal automation needs.</p>
<p>And so, goodbye IFTTT! ðŸ‘‹ I'm not put off by them charging for their service; I
think charging for software is a good thing! It's just that this was the nudge I
needed to move my automations to infrastructure that I have more control over,
which has other benefits outside the scope of this article. I'm thankful that a
service like IFTTT continues to exist; I still think it's a fantastic tool to
“on-ramp” less technical folks into automation and no-code tools.</p>

It’s why you read something that a friend wrote and thought, “hmm, that was pretty good,” but not, “press the pause button on life, I need to take notes!”</p><p><strong>Peer Assessment Bias is the natural inclination to be more skeptical of the ideas of those perceived as peers, more so than the ideas of those perceived as experts.</strong></p><p>Simply put, when it’s your friend’s idea it’s solid, but when it’s coming from Peter Thiel, it’s genius.</p><p>There’s an overlap here with another bias that you may be familiar with. Survivorship Bias.</p><p>Survivorship Bias is a cognitive error that occurs when a successful subgroup is mistaken as an <em>entire</em> group due to the visibility of the successful group and the invisibility of the unsuccessful group (<a href="https://fs.blog/2020/10/sharks-survivorship-bias/" target="_blank">link here to illustrate</a>).</p><p>As it applies here, most of the ideas we consume come from experts. This is because they’ve already defeated the gatekeeper and have been elevated to the point where their thoughts matter more than others. They’re the successful survivors.</p><p>So what’s the difference between my idea of Peer Assessment Bias and good old Survivorship Bias? And how do they overlap?</p><p>Survivorship Bias is a layer of Peer Assessment Bias, but they’re not the same.</p><p>Survivorship Bias, as it relates to assessment, would lead us to believe that the best ideas come from the people who have the largest audiences. We perceive these successful survivors as experts and give more weight to the ideas they produce, even those unrelated to why they became successful in the first place. This doesn’t explain what happens on the peer side of the equation.</p><p>Peer Assessment Bias is about how we perceive those “at the same level” as us, and it’s especially focused on those who are unestablished. “Experts” were once peers and have now moved on to an evolved state. Becoming an expert takes time, and many of the strong ideas that experts share are ideated during the time when they were an unheard of “peer.”</p><p>Peer Assessment Bias has less to do with the success of the idea and more to do with the source of it. It’s different because we may very well look a great idea straight in the face and treat it as a commoner instead of as the royalty that it is.</p><h3><strong>PAB Awareness</strong></h3><p>Why does any of this matter?</p><p>Because it’s important to recognize good ideas when you hear them.</p><p>There are two sides to Peer Assessment Bias to be aware of.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Don’t automatically elevate ideas from experts</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t automatically dismiss ideas from peers</strong></p></li></ol><p>Experts, the people we look up to, are placed on a pedestal. They’re given status as infallible.&nbsp;</p><p>This is wrong.</p><p>Yes, the people who’ve earned their expertise are most likely to keep producing thoughts or content that’s worth consuming, but never blindly. “Because Musk said it,” is not reason enough to accept an idea.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_8762"><div><p>But you know this already, you’re a responsible human. So let’s take a look at the other side of Peer Assessment Bias, the side that doesn’t come naturally.</p><p><strong>Don’t automatically dismiss ideas from peers.</strong></p><p>Pay attention to those around you. They can have ideas that are just as strong as those who’ve already earned the world’s attention. Often it’s not perfectly polished, not precisely explained, and never published in the Washington Post, but it could be just as good.</p><p>Allow me to illustrate.</p><p>This is Ayomide:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_10888"><div><p>Sure, he’s a doctor, so he’s a proven smart guy, but the point is that you don’t know him. Ayomide is in my writing community, <a href="https://writersblochq.com/" target="_blank">Writer’s Bloc</a>, and I’ve had the pleasure of reading some of his work in the draft phase.</p><p>In August, he wrote this essay called “<a href="https://docayomide.com/love/" target="_blank">Love Your Neighbor Doesn’t Mean What We Think</a>.” It’s excellent, you should read it. But to summarize, it comes down to this one sentence:</p><blockquote><p>“Act in your neighbor’s interest as if it was your own.”</p></blockquote><p>That’s an objectively brilliant way of reframing “love your neighbor as yourself.” It may not seem like it, but that little tweak makes things click mentally in a different way than we’re used to.</p><p>Ayomide isn’t an established personality. He’s not looked upon by thousands as a brilliant mind to be listened to or read each week.</p><p>But he has some fantastic ideas worth reading, and so do your peers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Empower Your Peers</strong></h3><p>The moral of this story is to cut your peers some slack.</p><p>The path to expertise is filled with early days of thoughts sent out into an empty void and then slowly adopted by a group of early fans. Those early fans are peers, and peer fans are the most important fans you can have. A show of support, a reliable voice for feedback, or a bit of help from someone promoting your work is sometimes all you need to keep pushing on to the point where you become an expert.</p><p>I’m no scientist, but there’s no doubt we’re harsher critics of our peers than we are of others we don’t know. Does this stem from personal self-doubt (I couldn’t do that, so they couldn’t do it either), a hint of jealousy, or another psychological misplacement? Maybe. But it does happen.</p><p>We have a mental bias to keep peers as peers and experts as experts. This is a bias like any other. One worthy of acknowledging and defeating.</p><p>Cut your peers some slack. Read their work. Promote their content. Champion their ideas. Stand behind them. Encourage their efforts.</p><p>To steal from my peer Ayomide; believe in your peer’s work the same way you believe in your own.</p><p>Now, go forth and lift up your peers.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The new EC2 Nitro Enclaves enable virtual machines to process private data without exposing its encryption key to the parent instance. In this post we will explore how Nitro Enclaves are used to securely process private keys stored in ACM.</p>
<p>This is part 2 in a two-part article. In the first part we review why Nitro Enclaves matter and how they can benefit your sensitive workloads: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">ACM for Nitro Enclaves - It’s a Big Deal</a>.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This article follows the steps outlined in AWS’ documentation: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html">AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves</a>. In their article, AWS builds the following architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/4volL2Vsj6GH8kyvLASvYq/ceb73ac4e50f8779794628e56900f2b7/refarch.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="ACM Reference Architecture"></p>
<p>As discussed in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">part 1</a>, it’s essential for private keys stored in ACM to never be exposed. As such, it’s interesting to see how AWS keeps these private keys secure, while still hosting them on your (relatively insecure) EC2 instance. The answer, of course, lies in the new <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">Nitro Enclaves</a>.</p>
<p>The two main topics for this post are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are private keys transmitted (and can we intercept them)?</li>
<li>How are permissions assigned to the Nitro Enclave (and can we assume them)?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Launching an EC2 instance</h3>
<p>The first step is to launch an Enclave-enabled EC2 instance. From the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html#nitro-enclave-reqs">requirements</a> we learn this can be any Nitro instance with an Intel or AMD processor. Further digging shows that the minimum size is an <code>m5a.xlarge</code>.</p>
<p>The operating system needs to be Linux. On Amazon Linux 2 the Nitro CLI is available in a yum repository. Installation instructions for other operating systems can be found on the Nitro Enclaves CLI <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli">Github page</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon has provided ready-to-go AMIs with NginX and the Nitro CLI pre-installed, so for this article we will use those. We will assign an IAM role with admin permissions to the instance so we won’t be limited in exploring access methods.</p>
<p>With the pre-build AMI deployed in a default VPC and an IAM role with admin permissions, our current architecture looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/4HFodRfnVjsleJ2YI6pVgg/66fce88c7b5ea3ba5234ae1bdee35d5e/deployment-1.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Deployment 1"></p>
<h3>Creating an ACM certificate</h3>
<p>ACM certificates are free, but we do need a valid domain name. I’ve once purchased <code>vpcdemo.net</code>, so that’s what I will use for this article.</p>
<p>After we’ve moved through the steps of requesting a certificate, it shows as <code>Issued</code> and has an ARN. We will need this ARN in the next step.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/5Oxxf6wRYgkMm7QgYxHyq/6933f73ec20c723ed0bd6a790e43b9d9/valid_cert.jpg?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Valid Certificate"></p>
<h3>Associating the IAM role with the certificate</h3>
<p>This is where it gets interesting. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#role-cert">next step</a> in the process is to “Associate the role with the ACM certificate”.</p>
<p>The command to achieve this is <code>aws ec2 --region [region] associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role --certificate-arn [certificate_ARN] --role-arn [role_ARN]</code></p>
<p>This means we’re telling ACM that our EC2 instance role is allowed to access this certificate and private key. But we haven’t created a Nitro Enclave yet, and this role is assigned to an EC2 instance <strong>we</strong> control. Does that mean we will be able to access the private key from our instance? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Running the command above yields the following output:</p>
<pre><code>aws ec2 --region eu-central-1 associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role
{
    "EncryptionKmsKeyId": "cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2", 
    "CertificateS3BucketName": "aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod", 
    "CertificateS3ObjectKey": "arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103"
}
</code></pre>
<p>This output obviously refers to three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>An S3 bucket (owned by AWS)</li>
<li>An S3 object (that likely contains our certificate and private key)</li>
<li>A KMS key (that is likely used to decrypt sensitive data)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, AWS describes we should assign new permissions to our EC2 instance’s IAM role:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/*"]
    },
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "kms:Decrypt"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:*:key/cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>These permissions allow our role to fetch an object from the AWS-owned S3 bucket, and to use the AWS-owned KMS key to decrypt data. Let’s update our architecture diagram with these new components.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/7MJ5bL64JTG0hyNkvSiMhp/485436f06a14e2c4165a4ec00c940209/deployment-2.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Deployment 2"></p>
<h3>Retrieving the file from S3</h3>
<p>The <code>CertificateS3BucketName</code> and <code>CertificateS3ObjectKey</code> clearly identify where the ACM files are stored. Since our IAM Role now has all the necessary permissions, we can try to download the file.</p>
<pre><code>[ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-108 ~]$ aws s3 cp s3://aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 .
download: s3://aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 to ./f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103
</code></pre>
<p>Lo and behold: it worked! We now have the ACM certificate files on our local machine. The million dollar question is what they contain.</p>
<h3>Analyzing the file contents</h3>
<p>We’ll output the file and run it through <code>jq</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/XdI3Sa3jYldy7criKPzHb/7ca202e4e65aaec1061f4400ee683073/file-contents.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="File Contents"></p>
<p>The contents are in JSON format, with four keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>certificate</code></li>
<li><code>certificateChain</code></li>
<li><code>encryptedPrivateKey</code></li>
<li><code>encryptionMethod</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two values are unencrypted, but these are the public certificate files anyone visiting <code>vpcdemo.net</code> would receive. No secrets there.</p>
<p>The third value is the private key we’re looking for. Obviously, it’s been encrypted. However, we also got access to a KMS key… Let’s see if we can use that to decrypt this value!</p>
<h3>Decrypting the private key</h3>
<p>First we’ll store the <code>encryptedPrivateKey</code> in a variable: <code>PRIVKEY=$(cat f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 | jq -r '.encryptedPrivateKey')</code>.</p>
<p>Then we’ll run the private key through KMS: <code>aws kms --region eu-central-1 decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://&lt;(echo $PRIVKEY | base64 -d) --output text --query Plaintext</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, but expectedly, this results in the following output:</p>
<pre><code>An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the Decrypt operation: The ciphertext refers to a customer master key that does not exist, does not exist in this region, or you are not allowed to access.
</code></pre>
<p>So this doesn’t work. Let’s find out why. We’ll start by looking at CloudTrail. It shows an interesting line:</p>
<pre><code>"errorMessage": "User: arn:aws:sts::123412341234:assumed-role/admin-role/i-025be0b6a191a2cde is not authorized to perform: kms:Decrypt on resource: arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:194321236082:key/cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2",
</code></pre>
<p>This shows us that the KMS key is stored in account <code>194321236082</code>, and that our role was not allowed to use it. This is interesting, because we did exactly follow AWS’ instructions, which added permissions for our role to use this KMS key. The answer must lie somewhere in the Nitro Enclaves.</p>
<h3>Running NginX with Nitro Enclaves</h3>
<p>After walking through the last few steps in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#config-nginx">AWS docs</a> we’ve got a running server with HTTPS:</p>
<pre><code>➜  ~ curl -I -XGET https://vpcdemo.net
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0
Date: Fri, 30 Oct 2020 13:24:26 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 3520
Last-Modified: Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:17:11 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "5ef398a7-dc0"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
</code></pre>
<p>In the NginX configuration at <code>/etc/pki/nginx/nginx-acm.conf</code> we see the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:model=p11ne-token;manufacturer=Amazon;token=nginx-acm-token;id=%01;object=acm-key;type=private?pin-value=8c9d293b5fcbe9bc5f70fa400822a936";
ssl_certificate "/run/nitro_enclaves/acm/nginx-cert-6e67696e782d61636d2d746f6b656e.pem";
</code></pre>
<p>So the Nitro Enclave was able to download and decrypt my certificate, even though the parent instance wasn’t. The next question is how AWS has secured their KMS key so the parent instance can’t use it, but the Nitro Enclave using the same IAM Role <em>can</em>.</p>
<h3>Attestation</h3>
<p>The answer can be found in Jeff Barr’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">blog post</a> and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html">Cryptographic attestation</a> chapter in the documentation. When a new enclave image file (the OS and code that runs in the enclave) is created, it will automatically hash its contents in various ways. These are then returned as platform configuration registers (PCRs). There are eight PCRs:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCR[0]: a hash of the enclave image file</li>
<li>PCR[1]: a hash of the Linux kernel and bootstrap</li>
<li>PCR[2]: a hash of the application</li>
<li>PCR[3]: a hash of the IAM role assigned to the parent instance</li>
<li>PCR[4]: a hash of the Instance ID of the parent instance</li>
<li>PCR[8]: a hash of the Enclave image file signing certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one (PCR0) can be used in a KMS condition. From the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html">KMS docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384 condition key allows the kms-decrypt, kms-generate-data-key, and kms-generate-random operations from an enclave only when the image hash from the signed attestation document in the request matches the value in the condition key. The ImageSha384 value corresponds to PCR[0] in the attestation document. This condition key is effective only when you call these APIs from an enclave using the Nitro Enclaves SDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from Jeff Barr’s blog post: “In a real-world environment, I would create a KMS key policy that checks the PCR value as part of a Condition statement:”</p>
<pre><code>"Condition": {
"StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
 "kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384": "ecfd7aa6d1dcca1e0bba646e7d49ede2761651c68f13cee68b1141c182cd836baae37d05dd8e6260aa847369a7b27e24"
}
</code></pre>
<p>In simple terms: every enclave image has a signature that changes when the content of the enclave image changes. By setting the PCR[0] value at the time the image was built as a condition in KMS, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation will only be allowed when executed by this exact version of the enclave image. When somebody tampers with the image - or tries to use the role from the parent instance as we did above - the PCR0 will change, the KMS condition will no longer match, and access will be denied.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The new AWS Nitro Enclaves allow EC2 instances to spin up an isolated child VM for cryptographic operations. This unlocks new security features, the first and maybe most important of which is ACM on EC2.</p>
<p>In this post we will explore why Nitro Enclaves are important. Specifically, we’ll discuss why Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) on EC2 matters. This is part 1 in a two-part article. In the second part - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they">ACM for Nitro Enclaves - How Secure Are They?</a> - we will do a deep dive on the internal mechanisms that make Nitro Enclaves tick.</p>
<h3>A brief introduction to HTTPS</h3>
<p>HTTPS, or HTTP over SSL, encrypts web traffic in transit. This prevents eavesdropping on sensitive information and guarantees that your browser is talking to the right server. To understand ACM, we need a quick overview of the basics of HTTPS. Please note that the details of this process might vary for different versions of SSL, TLS and cypher suites.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/1tLEomZQnmb8bsbzf6IeQM/729a794d26969cdc531622271c8e2b27/handshake.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="SSL Handshake"></p>
<p>When a browser connects to a server over HTTPS, it first requests the server’s public certificate (1). It then verifies if the certificate was signed by a trusted certificate authority (3). This validates that the server is allowed to use this domain name.</p>
<p>Next, the browser generates a new, random key, called the <em>session key</em>. It encrypts this session key with the public key stored in the server’s certificate. Then it sends the session key back to the server (4).</p>
<p>The server uses the private key it has locally (and privately, hence the name) stored to decrypt the session key (5). It is essential to understand that <em>only</em> this private key can decrypt the session key. If the private key would leak or be stolen, anyone would be able to decrypt traffic destined for this server, or they would be able to impersonate this server.</p>
<p>The server and client use the session key to encrypt all traffic from that moment on, and the communication between browser and server is secured.</p>
<p>For additional context, check out my YouTube session on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUpUIw5zH2g&amp;list=PLeJgtCMvQjZd0kuK82-Et9IYcp6EiOeYa&amp;index=10&amp;ab_channel=SentiaCloud">SSL and Scaling</a>.</p>
<h3>Introducing ACM</h3>
<p>From the introduction to HTTPS it should be clear that the private key is an extremely sensitive piece of data and should be protected at all costs. However, the web server <em>needs</em> access to the private key to decrypt traffic. Classically, this meant that any user or administrator with access to the server might also gain access to the private key and use it to nefarious ends.</p>
<p>This is where Amazon Certificate Manager comes in. ACM allows you to generate and store certificates in a highly secure Amazon environment. Specific trusted services, like Elastic Load Balancers and CloudFront, integrate with ACM and are allowed to retrieve the private keys stored in ACM. They then use these private keys to decrypt your traffic and forward the unencrypted traffic to your EC2 instances. The core feature of ACM is that it will <strong>never</strong> expose your private keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/65dW6dIbfPccC4HHz48dUS/1e53a34ad6880bae189ff27e3b08867e/acm-intro.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="ACM Intro"></p>
<p>With the traffic to EC2 decrypted, there is no reason to store private keys on the EC2 instances anymore. This reduces the impact of users gaining access to your servers, regardless whether they are malicious or not.</p>
<h3>End-to-end encryption</h3>
<p>The attentive reader will have noticed that this solution does not result in end-to-end encryption. The unencrypted traffic stays within Amazon’s boundaries, but strict industries like finance or healthcare will not appreciate their data being plainly transmitted - inside or outside of Amazon’s virtual walls.</p>
<p>This means that if end-to-end encryption is a requirement, we need to go back to the drawing board. Amazon offers CloudHSM, which can do SSL offloading for EC2 instances in a very secure way, but CloudHSM is very expensive. The cost for a single CloudHSM instance in Ireland is $1.47 per hour. In a highly available setup you need to, at $2.94 per hour, or over $2000,- per month. Strict security requirements obviously come at a cost.</p>
<p>Additionally, CloudHSM does not integrate with ACM, which often means you’re managing your certificates in more than one place.</p>
<h3>The new Nitro Enclaves</h3>
<p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">new Nitro Enclaves</a> change this landscape significantly. You can now have end-to-end encryption without CloudHSM, while keeping your private keys secure.</p>
<p>With Nitro Enclaves, you separate part of your virtual machine’s hardware - for example 1 CPU and 512MB of its memory - to run as an independent virtual machine. This VM runs in full isolation. You can’t access its disk or network, you can’t login to it, you can do hardly anything with it. The only interaction you can have is over a <code>vsock</code> interface that is mounted on your parent instance.</p>
<p>In the second part of this article (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they">ACM for Nitro Enclaves - How Secure Are They?</a>) we will go into the inner workings of this process. The important details for now are that the Nitro Enclave <em>can</em> access the KMS service through a KMS proxy running on the parent host, and that the Nitro Enclave is cryptographically signed. This means that when the enclave connects to KMS, KMS can verify that the request is coming from a trusted enclave. Because the enclave is isolated, KMS can securely transfer data to the enclave, without any risk of that data being intercepted or retrieved.</p>
<h3>The result for ACM on EC2</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how the Nitro Enclaves enable end-to-end encryption. As discussed before, the essence of ACM is that it will never expose your private keys. Nitro Enclaves, on the other hand, run in full isolation but can securely communicate with KMS. ACM for Nitro Enclaves combines these properties by sending encrypted traffic to the parent EC2 instance, which requests its child Nitro Enclave to decrypt the traffic. The Nitro Enclave securely communicates with ACM to fetch the private key, and all requirements are met.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/79B9BqMV4DUxzpWvYcIFq5/4fa51c30ce67678a905cf69bd8ed234f/enclave-kms-acm.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="ACM, KMS, Enclave"></p>
<h3>Technological marvel</h3>
<p>AWS are flexing their technological prowess here - big time. The ACM and KMS part is impressive, but mostly an elaboration on existing technologies. The Nitro Enclaves themselves, however, are taking virtualization to a whole new level. Taking a virtual machine and carving out CPU cores and memory to run <em>another</em> virtual machine in isolation, while the machine is running? Consider my mind blown.</p>
<p>This is the point where we see Amazon’s lead versus their competitors. While other public cloud providers are still building multi-AZ designs and getting their networking backbone in order, AWS has built a foundation that allows them to capitalize on completely new technologies and solutions.</p>
<p>I believe the Nitro architecture is still in its early days, and many more futuristic virtualization features await.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>No solution is perfect, and there are a few things you should know before rushing to implement Nitro Enclaves. First, there is instance sizing. Currently, the smallest supported instance for Nitro Enclaves is an <code>m5a.xlarge</code> with four vCPUs. You will likely split this into two vCPUs for the parent instance and two vCPUs for the enclave. Technically, you’re reserving an <code>m5a.large</code>'s worth of CPU for your enclave. In Ireland, this will cost $0.096 per hour, or about $70,- per instance per month. This is significantly cheaper than CloudHSM, but it’s not free either.</p>
<p>Second, only Linux and NginX currently support ACM for Nitro Enclaves. This means that if you’re running Apache, Tomcat, IIS or another solution for your web servers, you will need to wait for future support.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The new Nitro Enclaves unlock new ways to securely process sensitive data. ACM is a first example, but I’m sure many other implementations will soon be released. This article has explored why being able to process private data on an EC2 instance is a big deal.

<p>One of my favorite team retrospective activities is what I call the “I Suck” awards. </p>



<p>It’s simple. Here’s the process:</p>



<ul><li>Step 1: Someone kicks it off by saying why they suck at that moment</li><li>Step 2: The rest of the team laughs or empathizes or whatever the situation calls for</li><li>Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until everyone has said why they suck</li><li>Step 4: Vote on the winner of the “I Suck” award, aka the person with the most impressive suckitude that time around. </li></ul>



<p>Everyone sucks for some reason at any given time. Maybe they procrastinated. Maybe they missed an obvious bug. Maybe they keep forgetting to update the sprint board. Maybe they have been talking too much on calls. Maybe they didn’t submit their dang timesheet. Whatever it is, everyone has one.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons why I love this activity:</p>



<ul><li>It’s fun and often hilarious</li><li>It discourages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">Cover Your Ass (CYA)</a> Engineering</li><li>It gives people a chance to drop some tips for next time</li><li>It’s great for <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/27/the-whys-and-hows-of-jelling-teams/">team jelling</a> </li><li>It lets us learn from each other’s mistakes</li><li>It reduces the sense of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">shame that accompanies messing up</a></li></ul>



<p>I stole the idea from Radical Candor, which calls it the “<a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/encourage-feedback/#:~:text=Introduce%20Whoops-a-Daisy">Whoops-A-Daisy</a>“. </p>



<p>It’s powerful and it’s fun, so give it a shot! Why do you suck?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sadly, to tell you the truth, doing dishes is still a thing. However, so far most of our readers still like our non-standard Deep Learning tutorial.</em></p><p>Typically, AI is demonstrated as solving various toy problems. AI plays chess and Go, AI plays video games, AI makes people dance. It is time to stop this madness and finally apply AI in a meaningful way. Therefore, we proudly present the dish-o-tron. The dish-o-tron is an AI system designed to solve an actual real-world problem impacting millions of people around the world every day: facing dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink.</p><div id="attachment_77683"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77683" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png" alt="dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink" width="250" height="107" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-700x300.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-768x329.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-1536x659.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-120x51.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77683">dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink – a real-world problem</p></div><p>Reading this blog series will equip you with the ultimate power to solve this long-lasting problem in your community kitchen once and for all by using state-of-the-art AI technology.</p><h2>The dish-o-tron</h2><p>At first glance, the dish-o-tron is an inconspicuous, well-positioned webcam in the kitchen observing the shared kitchen sink. In its natural state the dish-o-tron is just happy and enjoys life. The dish-o-tron doesn’t care whether you prefer tea or coffee and it likes all kinds of kitchen talk. However, there is one single thing that the dish-o-tron absolutely hates: watching someone put dirty dishes in the community sink.</p><p>Detecting dirty dishes in the sink enrages the peace-loving dish-o-tron so much that it starts beeping. The only way to return it to its natural peaceful state and thus stopping the noise is to admit one’s mistake and remove all dirty dishes from the community sink, leaving it neat and clean again.</p><div id="attachment_78576"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78576" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-250x166.png" alt="respect privacy in the kitchen" width="250" height="166" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-250x166.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-700x465.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-768x510.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-1536x1020.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-120x80.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen.png 1984w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78576">privacy in the kitchen has to be respected.</p></div><p>Building the dish-o-tron requires three high-level steps:</p><ul><li>Gathering and preparing data</li><li>Training an AI model</li><li>Deployment of the model</li></ul><p>In the following, we will discuss these steps further.</p><h2>Gathering and preparing data</h2><p>Trying to solve real-world problems with AI often starts with the realisation that there is little or even no data available. This issue prevents many problem solvers from actually solving the problem. “If only data collection had started years ago!”, they say, “then we could now actually solve the problem”. While this is a reasonable thought, it simply doesn’t help.</p><p>Consoling users currently facing a problem by saying that it is necessary to gather lots of data for quite some time before we can start building a solution is at least challenging. Typically a more promising approach is to build a system addressing the problem which is able to improve over time.</p><p>In this way, we will not solve the problem completely in the first step; however, we will tackle the problem right away and put ourselves in a position to iteratively adjust the solution to match the requirements which also become more and more clear while working on the problem.</p><p>Since our problem is unique in a sense that there is no Kaggle dataset readily available, we start our journey to building the dish-o-tron by doing our best to collect a suitable dataset for a first working system. Here, we will make videos of various kitchen sinks clean and not clean and split them up into a first labeled dataset.</p><p>In this way, we started collecting the DIRTY-DISHES-DATASET with thousands of pictures that we will share with you in the next article.</p><div id="attachment_77687"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77687" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png" alt="sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset" width="250" height="151" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-700x424.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-768x465.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-120x73.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77687">sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset</p></div><h2>Training an AI model</h2><p>Not so long ago, training an AI model was tedious and required expert knowledge. In many cases this is still true today. Depending on the problem, we have to figure out a suitable model architecture and feature engineering and this requires some experimentation before we can train a suitable AI model. This is another issue which prevents problem solvers from building a solution tackling the whole problem even if data is available.</p><p>Fortunately, image classification is one of the best understood use cases in AI. There are lots of established best practices regarding model architectures and training of models. Among others this led to two things:</p><ul><li>High-level software libraries such as fast.ai which abstract away lots of the nitty-gritty details of image classification, providing a black-box kind of approach where state-of-the-art practises are simply utilised without burdening the user with the details.</li><li>Machine Learning as a service offerings from various public cloud providers such as automl and rekognition allowing training of image classification models on custom data in a few simple steps.</li></ul><p>Both approaches will typically not lead to the absolutely best solution. However, most of the time this is not necessary and ‘good enough’ will be just fine and a nice trade-off between time &amp; money spent vs. result. For our first version of the dish-o-tron, we will employ the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoML Service</a> from Google Cloud to train a first model.</p><p>We can use various tools to inspect the model and try to explain if the black box learns what we expect.</p><div id="attachment_77689"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77689" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png" alt="visualizing what the dish-o-tron model has actually learned" width="250" height="191" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-700x535.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-768x587.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-120x92.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png 1412w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77689">Visualizing what the model has actually learned.</p></div><p>The training of the AI model with AutoML and its technical details will be discussed in a follow-up blog post.</p><h2>Deployment of the model</h2><p>Having an AI model generally will not solve an actual real-life problem. For a viable solution, the AI model has to be integrated into a suitable context. Many times, this is the key step to generating any value at all. Nevertheless, this step is often postponed to the distant future after “collecting high quality data” and “building the best AI model”. This is, more often than not, a mistake because integrating the model into its context poses various challenges on its own. Hence, it should not be ignored and instead tackled early in order to learn and identify the associated challenges.</p><p>While building the dish-o-tron, we tried multiple options to run the model. We deployed it on a Pi Zero which is a really small and cheap device that can be glued anywhere with a small powerbank. But it is rather slow. We ran the model in the browser using our notebook’s webcam with TensorFlow.js. We used the Google AIY Kit, which is much faster than the Pi Zero and also comes with a beeper and blinking lights (but it is quite old and deploying state-of-the-art models is hacky). Finally, we used the Google Coral device, which is made for this kind of workload and well-integrated into Google AutoML but comes with a price tag.</p><p>The community kitchen is a special place. It’s a place where rumors are born, where gossip is produced and where you can openly chat about the most secret secrets of your company! That’s why dish-o-tron is living on the edge. Edge devices enable you to run audio and video analytics AND respect the privacy of your community kitchen. No image is transferred to the cloud. Nothing is saved. Dish-o-tron sees and forgets.</p><div id="attachment_77691"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77691" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png" alt="various edge devices" width="250" height="85" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-700x237.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-768x261.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-2048x695.png 2048w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-120x41.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77691">Various edge devices</p></div><p>Moreover, the hardware we consider and buy in order to actually build the dish-o-tron will establish basic conditions for our solution space. In other words, we have to mind that it is possible to painlessly deploy the AI model on our preferred edge device. For the first version of the dish-o-tron, we decided to use a Google AIY kit (see video below). For the next version, we chose a Google Coral edge device, which allows us to run advanced computer vision tasks on a Raspberry-size mini computer. Fortunately, AutoML allows us to export models in a viable format.</p><div id="attachment_77693"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77693" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png" alt="Google coral device" width="250" height="131" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-700x366.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-768x401.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-1536x803.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-120x63.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77693">Google coral device</p></div><p>The construction of the dish-o-tron including the deployment of the model on the Coral device and its technical details will be discussed in an upcoming blog post.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>AI research has brought us new technology that can solve problems that couldn’t be solved before.

<p>Next month, Brazil will launch its first nationwide digital instant-payment system. On November 16, Pix will go live on banking apps, digital wallets, and other services throughout Latin America’s largest financial market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pix was created by Brazil’s <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/w-006-8837?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;__lrTS=20191105091102789&amp;firstPage=true">Central Bank</a>, which has the power of life and death over all Brazilian financial institutions. The system is virtually free to use, a novelty in a country with a very efficient but expensive banking system.</p>



<p>Although it will be mandatory only for the largest banks, Pix will be available for all Brazilians whose bank or credit union opts in. Already, people are embracing the new system; on the first registration day ahead of launch, <a href="https://neofeed.com.br/blog/home/no-pix-uma-lista-e-a-chave-da-discordia-entre-bancos-e-fintechs/">millions of users</a> signed up for the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But not everyone is so enthusiastic. Pix’s simplicity and low cost will eat into the revenue streams of big banks, which typically charge users for fast transfers. It also complicates the business models of some of Brazil’s most successful startups. And by combining these features with a countrywide mandate, Pix might finally accomplish something that up until a few years ago was unthinkable: killing cash transactions in Brazil.</p>



<h3><strong>Why did the Brazilian Central Bank create Pix?</strong></h3>



<p>Pix has been in the works<a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/gtpaginst_reunioes"> since mid-2018</a>. Back then, there were a few instant-payment systems available in Brazil. Yet those that did exist were either limited to a specific bank’s clientele or had been launched by startups.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>“We had been signaling the need for instant payments to the market since 2013,” said Mayara Yano, an analyst at the Central Bank. But, according to Yano, there were too many barriers and not enough incentives for a private company to create a service to be adopted by the banking system as a whole.</p><p>With Pix, the Central Bank also means to restrain the use of paper money, still popular in everyday life. It’s typical of mom and pop shops to offer 5% to 10% discounts for cash payments to avoid card-processing fees, for example.</p></div>



<p>Limiting paper currency with Pix would help the Central Bank with two other problems: limit its expenses with producing and distributing bills and coins, and boost the government’s investigations of financial fraud, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/bolsonaro-declares-brazil-corruption-free-and-ends-carwash-probe">a hot-button issue in Brazil</a>. After all, cash transactions are almost impossible to track, but Pix payments will be all saved in their users’ banking apps.<br></p>



<p>Pix isn’t the first government-imposed payment mandate in Brazil’s history. In 2002, the Central Bank created a money transfer mechanism that took less than one hour on weekdays and would be completed by the next working day on weekends and holidays. The mechanism, called TED, was mandatory for all banks.</p>



<p><br>Pix, of course, isn’t mandatory for everybody. But it may as well be, since it is mandatory for banks with more than 500,000 clients; the group comprises 34 banks, which serve 90% of the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/10/pandemia-leva-a-bancarizacao-de-quase-10-milhoes-de-pessoas.shtml">175.4 million Brazilians who own bank accounts</a>. It is optional for smaller banks, fintech startups, credit unions, and other financial service providers.</p>



<h3><strong>How will it work?</strong></h3>



<div><p>Pix relies on identifiers like QR codes, email addresses, and telephone numbers to perform money transfers in up to 10 seconds, including on weekends and holidays. It will be incorporated into banking and payment apps, digital wallets, and other kinds of financial services. Once available, Pix will provide an alternative to existing fast money transfers, which cost an average of 10 Brazilian reais each in fees ($2).</p><p>The system functions virtually for free<strong>; </strong>the Central Bank charges financial institutions just 1 Brazilian centavo ($0.0018) for every 10 Pix transactions, and it’s up to them if they will pass along that cost to their clients.</p><p>To sign up, a user must submit up to five pieces of personal information, such as an email address, a cell phone number, or a tax ID, that will be used as a “Pix key” to identify them in a money transfer. Users will also be given a QR code, which can be used to send or receive payments. If they have a bank account, they can use their checking account information to process a Pix transaction, much like a traditional bank transfer.</p></div>

<h3><strong>How will Pix affect Brazilian banks and fintech startups?</strong></h3>



<p>The government hasn’t disclosed any studies of how Pix could impact Brazil’s economy. But it’s clear that the new technology will hit big banks the hardest, as well as big-name payment intermediaries, like point-of-sale and card-machine operators Cielo and Rede. German consulting group Roland Berger forecasts that the latter could lose up to <a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/empresas/noticia/2020/07/03/pix-tira-ate-r-13-bi-de-credenciadoras.ghtml"></a><a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/empresas/noticia/2020/07/03/pix-tira-ate-r-13-bi-de-credenciadoras.ghtml">13 billion reais</a> ($2.6 billion).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pix also threatens what has been a lucrative revenue stream for Brazil’s “Big Five” banks — Itaú, Bradesco, Santander, Banco do Brasil, and Caixa Econômica Federal — which collectively make 2.2 billion reais ($440 million) a year from fees for same-day money transfers.</p>







<p>But a potential loss in transfer revenues isn’t the only danger to the Big Five. Now that they’re on the same footing when it comes to transfer fees, they risk losing clients to digital wallets and online-only banks. As of 2019, more than <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/publicacoes/relatorioeconomiabancaria/REB_2019.pdf">80% of Brazil’s total credit operations</a>, valued at 2.90 trillion reais ($580 billion), were concentrated in the Big Five. “Pix will challenge the entire market to provide quality digital services at lower prices,” said Cláudio Guimarães Júnior, executive director of the Brazilian Association of Banks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional banks such as Itaú e Bradesco<a href="https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/itau-e-do-bradesco-chamam-atencao-para-seguranca-e-defendem-pix"> have voiced concerns</a> about the system’s security and complained that the launch date is too early. “[Battling Pix] is like trying to stop the wind with your hands,” said João Bragança, specialist in payment methods at Roland Berger.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>But the effects of Pix could cut both ways. Established digital payment startups like <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/brazilian-instant-payment-pix-will-allow-withdrawals-in-retail-stores/">PicPay</a>, with its 20 million active users, and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brazils-pagseguro-digital-raises-23-billion-ipo-stock-jumps-2018-01-24">PagSeguro</a>, which raised about 13.2 billion reais ($2.3 billion) during its initial public offering on Nasdaq, may be in trouble. One of their services is instant digital payments, something Pix will provide universally and for free.</p><p>But whether you’re a big bank or a small fintech firm, there’s no fighting the Central Bank. The Brazilian government will also allow big retailers to adopt Pix as a payment option, often with cashback offers, a novelty in Brazil. In order to compete, PicPay and other digital-payment companies will need to diversify their services.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h3><strong>What will change for Brazilians?</strong></h3>



<p>Even with Brazilians being as fond of cash as they are now, financial experts are expecting Pix to gain a stranglehold on non-cash payments and money transfers within the next few years. An analysis by Accenture anticipates some <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/brazils-instant-payments-system-can-reach-20-million-users-in-its-first-year/">48 billion reais</a> ($9.6 billion) to move through the Pix system by the end of its first year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study predicts that Pix will achieve mass adoption (i.e., be used for 25% of all household payments) within five years and move between 1 trillion reais ($200 billion) and 1.5 trillion reais ($300 billion) per year. That’s close to 20% of Brazil’s current GDP of 7.3 trillion reais ($1.46 trillion). “The Brazilian card industry, both debit and credit, moved 1.8 trillion reais ($360 billion) in 2019. So Pix can have practically that same size in 2025,” said Ricardo Pandur, payment specialist at Accenture.</p>



<p>But it remains to be seen who exactly will turn to Pix. The Central Bank is betting on its appeal to the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/10/pandemia-leva-a-bancarizacao-de-quase-10-milhoes-de-pessoas.shtml">36 million Brazilians</a> with no bank accounts. For them, Pix could serve as an entry point to financial services.</p>

<div><p>For consumers, Pix will be an alternative to cash and debit cards, a cheap, fast method of money transfer, and even an easy way to pay taxes. For retailers, Pix will be cheaper than card operators, with potentially zero cost to them or their customers.</p><p>But access to Pix is conditional on access to a smartphone or a computer as well as a stable data connection. Even with increased connectivity and phone use, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/Pew-Research-Center_Global-Technology-Use-2018_2019-02-05.pdf">40% of all Brazilian adults</a> still don’t have a smartphone. Potential users might have trouble understanding the system of personal keys and QR codes. “Understanding a payment mechanism is not as simple as learning to use social media,” said Ricardo Rocha, a professor of finance at Insper in São Paulo.</p></div>



<div><p>With new technology comes new vulnerabilities to scams and phishing attempts. Pix will be incorporated into banks’ native apps and websites and have the added benefit of encrypted transactions. But it will be up to the same banks to explain the risks while pushing for widespread adoption.</p><p>Some startups might have been pushing for adoption a little too far.&nbsp;Clients of online banks <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/david-velez-nubank/">Nubank</a> and C6 and digital wallets PagSeguro and MercadoPago took to social media to complain that the companies registered their keys <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/10/19/procon-notifica-nubank-e-mercado-pago-sobre-cadastramento-de-chaves-no-pix.ghtml">without their explicit consent</a>. The Central Bank started a <a href="https://exame.com/seu-dinheiro/bc-investiga-denuncia-de-cadastramento-indevido-das-chaves-do-pix/">formal investigation</a> and Brazil’s primary consumer defense entity <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/10/19/procon-notifica-nubank-e-mercado-pago-sobre-cadastramento-de-chaves-no-pix.ghtml">questioned</a> their methods, but the corporations claimed they followed all guidelines and that their clients were notified via apps.</p></div>



<p>Even so, the future of Pix looks promising. Between October 5, when the Central Bank started to allow users to enroll their Pix keys ahead of the November launch date, and October 22, there have been 50 million enrollments. On the first day alone, 3.5 million keys entered the system, and the demand was so high that many banking apps crashed.</p>

<p>In this edition of the <a href="https://ottverse.com/category/industry-spotlight/">Industry Spotlight</a> series, we take a look at <a href="https://www.piconets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picoNETS</a>; a startup focused on building Deep Edge Content Delivery Networks or Deep Edge Caching for Telcos and Content Providers.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at their product, journey, USP, and what sets them apart from the rest, shall we?</p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_picoNETS"></span>Who is picoNETS?<span></span></h2>



<p>picoNETS is a&nbsp;<strong>Deep Edge Content Delivery Network</strong>&nbsp;provider started in 2016, and they primarily work with telecom and content providers. Some of their USPs and accomplishments are –</p>



<ul><li>They are a Deep Edge CDN for media delivery and also provide edge computing resources.</li><li>picoNETS is a partner of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ruralcloud.com/">Rural Cloud Initiative</a>&nbsp;in the US and is engaged with top OTT platforms in India</li><li>They are live in 5G Labs for a US Telco and have gained traction with Carriers, Telcos, and ISPs in the US, UK, India, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Fiji.</li></ul>



<h2><span id="How_does_picoNETS%E2%80%99_Edge_Caching_Work"></span>How does picoNETS’ Edge Caching Work?<span></span></h2>



<p>Before we dive into the “how,” let’s understand why there is a need for a&nbsp;<strong>deep edge CDN</strong>&nbsp;like the one offered by picoNETS.</p>



<p>Let’s take the example of rural America. </p>



<p>A recent article from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/21504476/online-school-covid-pandemic-rural-low-income-internet-broadband">The Verge</a>&nbsp;highlighted the struggle faced by rural Americans in their pursuit of high speed Internet and how this problem was exacerbated in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/j6wor7/americas_internet_wasnt_prepared_for_online/">raging debate on the same article in Reddit</a>&nbsp;underscored the struggle of everyday, rural America.</p>



<p>In addition to a lack of high-speed internet, if a CDN provider does not have a point of presence (PoP) near your city/town/village, then you are going to face problems with streaming video. </p>



<p>Video streaming problems manifest in different ways – a long delay in showing the first picture (startup delay or latency), buffering issues during playback, or while seeking back or forth in the video, and in the worst case, complete stalls or fatal errors. Apart from these problems, a low-bandwidth connection is quite likely to result in a low resolution (or bitrate) video being delivered to your device.</p>



<p>All of these problems amount to an abysmal viewing experience, right?</p>



<p>So what’s the solution to these problems?</p>



<p>Well, one could argue that it’s up to the CDN provider to establish more POPs (geographically distributed) and improve their coverage. While this is a reasonable argument, it can be challenging in terms of infrastructural costs and the RoI for the CDN provider.</p>



<p>However, if you continue this train of thought, you end up with a business model that establishes POPs at a much more granular level.</p>



<p>What do I mean by this?</p>



<p>Well, instead of establishing a POP in every town or city, why not go deeper and install a POP at every airport, shopping mall, school, university, or post office?</p>



<p>Is it possible? Well, it sure is and <strong>this is the USP of picoNETS.</strong></p>



<p>picoNETS go “deep” and establish “deep edge caches” right next to your underserved target audience to ensure that they get a fantastic QoE.</p>



<p>A prototypical customer of picoNETS could be a university that uses the deep edge cache to provide buffer-free, high quality, online classes for their students (live or on-demand).</p>



<p>Here is an illustration of the concept we just discussed. </p>

<h2><span id="The_benefit_of_using_picoNETS"></span>The benefit of using picoNETS<span></span></h2>



<p>Now that we’ve established that picoNETS brings caching closer to your customer (the “why” and the “how”), the benefits are evident and critical to a good user experience. </p>



<p>With picoNETS, you get,</p>



<ul><li><strong>low latency media delivery</strong>&nbsp;– this is important in reducing stalls, and time-to-first-byte, startup-delay</li><li><strong>reduced buffering</strong>&nbsp;during playback and during seeks.</li><li>the ability to <strong>scale and deliver media</strong> when content goes viral especially, in a geo-localized manner. </li></ul>



<p>Another cool use-case for picoNETS is in the online multiplayer gaming industry. </p>



<p>It is important for gaming engines to synchronize each player’s location with the rest of the players, or else the game-play is spoiled, and there could be unfair advantages to certain players over others.</p>



<p>picoNETS tries to solve such problems by&nbsp;<strong>providing edge-computing</strong>&nbsp;in addition to their edge caching capabilities. By moving the decision and synchronization engines closer to the players (edge, i.e.), game-play is improved, and the latency incurred in player-synchronization is reduced.</p>



<p>All this sounds nice, right? But, my mind went straight to a commercial deployment scenario and I wasn’t sure how picoNETS would work alongside a traditional CDN. Do you need to use both or either one?</p>



<p>Well, let’s find out. </p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_You_Choose_Between_a_CDN_and_picoNETS_Deep_Edge_Cache"></span>How Do You Choose Between a CDN and picoNETS Deep Edge Cache?<span></span></h2>



<p>While speaking to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishrbedekar">Ashish Bedekar</a>, picoNETS’ COO, I asked him what a typical deployment looks like and how does it impact their customers’ operations?</p>



<p>He mentioned that the deployment is quite straightforward (similar to other CDN deployments). And, the decision to switch between a customers’ incumbent, traditional CDN and picoNETS happens at the CMS level.</p>



<p>At the CMS, a decision is taken to playback a stream using the CDN or with the picoNETS Deep Edge Cache. The decision is based on the ASN value, and Ashish told me that the rules could be more fine-grained as needed.</p>



<p>For example, their multi-CDN router allows you to add rules to direct premium subscribers’ traffic vs. others. Also, they have fail-over policies to ensure that the end-user is never left hanging!</p>



<p>This multi-CDN approach is smart and allows you to fine-tune your deployment to take advantage of each service (CDN &amp; picoNETS) in its “area of strength”.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of their architecture that demonstrates this. </p>

<p>Again, it’s best to get in touch with picoNETS to discuss specifics.</p>



<h2><span id="Get_in_touch_with_picoNETS"></span>Get in touch with picoNETS<span></span></h2>



<p>To learn more about their technology and to talk to the picoNETS team for further information, you can either <a href="https://www.piconets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit their website</a> or <a href="mailto:ashish.bedekar@piconets.com">email Ashish Bedekar</a>.</p>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>It is critical to get your content delivery strategy on point when it comes to OTT and I think there is a lot of scope for improving the current techniques used in CDNs, Edge Caching, P2P, etc. with the ultimate goal of providing a sublime viewing experience for the end-users.</p>



<p>I think the work that picoNETS is doing is great, serves a very underserved segment of our population, and helps them enjoy the same benefits as those in urban areas!</p>

		Study says happy people are less likely to experience memory decline with age.	</p><div>
		
<!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quickadsense.com/ -->

<p>The structure and function of brain cells continues to change throughout life, and most of its aspects decline as we age in response to a number of lifestyle factors. As these cells lose their ability to communicate with each other, our ability to retain memory disintegrates. But, is there a way to stop it from happening, or at least slow it down a bit?</p>
<p>Yes, and that’s by keeping a positive outlook in life.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/2020-oct-positive-outlook-memory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study</a> at Association for Psychological Science has revealed that people who lead a cheerful, enthusiastic life full of pride and joy are less likely to experience memory decline as they age. Psychologists have a term for it, and it’s called “<a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-79061-9_2193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positive affect</a>”. So the more a person experiences a positive affect, the more he or she is likely to retain memories, of which some could even last a lifetime.</p>

<p>For the study, the team looked at data from 991 adults who took part in a national study conducted three times between 1995 and 1996, 2004 and 2006, and 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>Researchers then gauged the reports on a range of positive emotions the participants had experienced over the past 30 days. They also asked participants to take part in a memory test which consisted of recalling words immediately after a presentation and again 15 minutes later.</p>
<p>After successfully examining the association between positive affect and memory decline, while accounting for factors like age, gender, education, depression, negative affect, and extraversion, they found that individuals with higher levels of positive affect had a better memory retention over the course of almost a decade compared to those that had experienced lesser positive affect.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote><p>This article was originally published on Mateusz's <a href="https://dev.to/mpodlasin/functional-programming-in-js-part-i-composition-currying-lodash-and-ramda-1ohb">dev.to profile</a>.</p><p>Mateusz says about himself: "I write in-depth articles about JavaScript, React and functional programming."</p></blockquote><p>In this series of articles, we will go through a soft introduction to functional programming in JavaScript.</p><p>Each article will be devoted to a different aspect of functional programming. After the theoretical introduction, we will see how those concepts are then used in actual, real world JavaScript libraries.</p><p>This mix of theory and practice will ensure that you get a deep understanding of all the concepts while being able to use them effortlessly in practice in your day to day work.</p><p>Please be aware that this series assumes that you already have some proficiency in writing code with arrays' methods such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>reduce</code>. If they still confuse you, let me know, and I will write an article explaining them in-depth.</p><p>Ready? Let's get started!</p><h2>Composition</h2><p>If I had to name in one word what this first article will focus on, it would be <em>composition</em> or <em>composability</em>.</p><p>More specifically, I mean here the art of composing your code from small, reusable functions, almost like composing a lego set from smaller pieces.</p><p>It turns out that a properly written functional code is very composable. What does it mean? It means that it is extremely easy to take a small piece of that code and reuse it in a completely different situation.</p><p>Take a look at this code, written in traditional style:</p><pre><code><span>let</span> result <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> i <span>&lt;</span> data<span>.</span><span>length</span><span>,</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> num <span>=</span> <span>parseInt</span><span>(</span>data<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>num <span>&lt;</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        result<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>num<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>and now compare it to:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>stringToInt</span> <span>=</span> <span>str</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>parseInt</span><span>(</span>str<span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span>

<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> data
    <span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>stringToInt<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Those two snippets do the same thing. We first take the <code>data</code> array, which is filled with some strings. We then transform those strings into integers. And finally, we store only those integers that are strictly smaller than 5 in a new array. We keep that array under the <code>result</code> variable.</p><p>So if we got an <code>["1", "6", "3"]</code> array, we would return <code>[1, 3]</code> as a result.</p><p>Depending on which style you are more accustomed to, you will find one of the two above snippets more readable. I believe that the second one is more readable because - not taking into the account little helper functions that we defined - it reads almost like English:</p><p>Take <code>data</code>, <code>mapEach</code>, <code>stringToInt</code> and then <code>filter</code> only those values that are <code>lessThan(5)</code>.</p><p>However, if you are not used to functional style, this second snippet will seem awkward and needlessly convoluted. Are there any objective benefits of writing the code in that style?</p><p>Of course! And that benefit is exactly the composability. Note that we went out of our way to define even the simplest pieces of our code as functions. Thanks to that, we can now use those snippets in entirely new situations without ever writing the same code twice.</p><p>Of course, those reusable <code>stringToInt</code> and <code>lessThan</code> functions are extremely simple, to the point where it arguably is not worth reusing them like that. But keep in mind that this example only serves as a motivation for the whole approach.</p><p>In more complex applications, those functions would be getting more and more complicated. The approach of reusing the most amount of code possible and composing new code from previously written functions will have much more apparent benefits in a bigger codebase.</p><p>Note also that apart from the simplest possible reusability - simply using <code>stringToInt</code> and <code>lessThan</code> functions in different contexts - we also see examples of using higher-order array functions - <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>. It is key to note that they possess an immense power - they allow you to use functions defined for singular values (for example, strings) on whole arrays of those values (for instance, on arrays of strings).</p><p>This is the first moment when you can see the power of that approach. You wrote two functions - <code>stringToInt</code> and <code>lessThan</code> - that are not supposed to be used on arrays. And yet, by wrapping them in only a few more characters - <code>.map(stringToInt)</code>, <code>.filter(lessThan(5))</code> - you suddenly possess the power to use those functions on whole arrays of values.</p><p>This is precisely what we meant at the beginning. The functional approach allows you to use the same code in entirely different contexts - in fact, here, the same code is even used on completely different types of values! A function that was meant to work only on strings can now work on arrays of strings! That's pretty cool.</p><h2>Currying</h2><p>Perhaps you have already asked yourself - "wait, what is this weird definition of <code>lessThan</code> about?".</p><p>If I asked you to write a <code>lessThan</code> function, you would probably do it like that:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>num<span>,</span> compareTo</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>And yet we did it like that:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>Not only arguments are switched, but also the syntax of a function definition is different. Is this some new, exotic addition to the JavaScript standard?</p><p>In fact, no. What we did here is that we wrote a function that returns another function.</p><p>Function that we are returning is:</p><pre><code><span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>And then we wrap it in another function, that finally provides <code>compareTo</code> variable for it:</p><pre><code><span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>This time we wrapped the returned function in parentheses for better readability.</p><p>Note that we used here the fact that in an arrow function, we can provide returned value directly, instead of the function body. If we wanted to write the body, we might rewrite the above example like so:</p><pre><code><span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>In fact, this pattern doesn't really rely on ES6 arrow function syntax. Me might have as well written it in old school function syntax:</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>compareTo</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>What ES6 arrow syntax does, however, is that it makes that monstrous code look much nicer:</p><pre><code><span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>That pattern is called currying.</p><p>If you take a function taking some number of parameters:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b<span>,</span> c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>you can "curry" it (or produce its "curried" version), which looks like that:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>In this case, the original function accepts three parameters.</p><p>After currying it, we get a function that accepts one parameter <code>a</code>, returns a function that takes one parameter <code>b</code>, then returns a function that accepts one parameter <code>c</code> and finally executes the original function's body.</p><p>Ok, we explained <em>how</em> that mechanism works, but we didn't explain why we even decided to write our functions like that.</p><p>Frankly, the answer is extremely simple. The only reason is so that we could later use the <code>lessThan</code> function like so:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Note that if we used our first definition of that function:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>num<span>,</span> compareTo</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>then applying it in the <code>filter</code> method wouldn't be nearly as nice. We would have to write that code like so:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>lessThan</span><span>(</span>num<span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>So again, you see that we wrote our function in a way that makes it compose nicely with methods such as <code>filter</code>.</p><p>It also composes nicely with a <code>map</code>. Writing code like this:</p><pre><code>numbers<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>would return an array of booleans saying if the number on a given place in the array is smaller than 5. For example, running that code on an array <code>[5, 1, 4]</code>, would return an array <code>[false, true, true]</code>.</p><p>So you can see that <code>lessThan</code> function composes now much nicer with other, higher-order functions.</p><p>On top of that, assume we noticed that we use <code>lessThan</code> very often with a number 5 specifically. Maybe that's a very important number, let's say a number of the servers we have in the company.</p><p>This number now appears in several places in our code. But having it hard-coded like that is a very bad practice. What if that number changes at some point, for example, to a 6? We would have to search for all those appearances of 5 and change them to 6 manually. This would be both too cumbersome and error-prone.</p><p>The first solution that comes to mind is to store that number in a variable, a constant with some semantic name that describes what this number means:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Now we can use the constant instead of the number:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>If that number changes (for example, our company buys more servers), we can update it in one place, where that constant is defined.</p><p>This is certainly nicer and very readable, but it's still a tiny bit cumbersome to import two distinct values (<code>lessThan</code> and <code>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</code>) even though we always want to use them together.</p><p>However, the way we defined the <code>lessThan</code> function allows us to fix that. We can store the returned function in another variable!</p><pre><code><span>const</span> lessThanNumberOfServers <span>=</span> <span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Now, whenever we want to use that function with that specific value, we can import it once and use it directly:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>lessThanNumberOfServers<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Our function is more composable with other functions, but it also allows us to define new functions in a very easy manner.</p><p>Very often certain values in our functions are only some kind of configuration. Those values do not change very often. In fact, you will often find yourself hard-coding those values inside your functions:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>someArguments</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>const</span> <span>SOME_VALUE_THAT_WILL_PROBABLY_NOT_CHANGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>

   <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>It's sometimes a good idea to put such value as an argument of a curried function and simply create a new function, with this value already set to a value we expect to be the most common:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someBiggerFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>someValueThatWillProbablyNotChange</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>someArguments</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> someFunction <span>=</span> <span>someBiggerFunction</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>This pattern is handy because it ultimately gives you the same result - a function with a value hard-coded inside. But at the same time, you get much bigger flexibility. When it turns out it is necessary to set that variable to some …</p></div></div></div>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="device-pinning">
  Device Pinning
  <a href="#device-pinning">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cpu"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cuda:0"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>

  <p><strong>Tensors Created During Tracing Will Have Their Device Pinned</strong></p>
<p>This can be a significant performance and portability problem.</p>

</blockquote>

  Performance and Portability

</h3>
<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<h2 id="direct-graph-modification">
  Direct Graph Modification
  <a href="#direct-graph-modification">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>

        <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>,</span> <span>pin_mem</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>inputs</span><span>())</span>
        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>constant</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'prim::Constant'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing. The export path to ONNX and then to TensorRT can fail due to missing or incompatible operations at either step and this can be frustrating.</p>
<p>After the obligatory Google search, I’ve found a reasonable hail-mary approach is to rewrite your tensor processing code to avoid unsupported operators. I can’t give general advice for this but let me show you an example of how this can be possible: <code>repeat_interleave</code>.</p>

<p>Recently while working on my <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/an-intel-mcs-48-based-dual-temperature-sensor/">MCS-48 temperature sensor</a> project I had to confront one of the largest challenges, which is to implement an option where changing a jumper displayed Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. The output from the DS18B10 temperature sensors is Celsius only, as it should be, so a conversion would need to be performed.</p>



<figure><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CodeCogsEqn.gif" alt=""><figcaption>A quick reminder of the conversion needed to be performed</figcaption></figure>



<p>In my case it’s +320 as I’m using fixed point arithmetic i.e. 15.3° = 153. This is a tough conversion to perform on an MCS-48 as we’ve got a bunch of different operations needed here:</p>



<ul><li>16-bit negate (more about that below)</li><li>16-bit unsigned multiply</li><li>16-bit unsigned divide</li><li>16-bit add with wrap-around</li></ul>



<p>A tall order for a CPU which has just <em>one </em>math instruction: 8-bit add. To perform all of this, one must sling a long sequence of primitive instructions together. Since this is an assembly language only architecture, I couldn’t cheat by compiling it in C and pinching the resulting instructions as I have done for PIC16 in the past.</p>



<p>The best place to find such examples is in the MCS-48 assembly language manual:</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-800x638.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-800x638.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-300x239.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-150x120.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-768x612.jpg 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-1536x1224.jpg 1536w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-2048x1633.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>(A scan of it can be viewed <a href="http://www.nj7p.org/Manuals/PDFs/Intel/9800255D.pdf">here</a>). Everything I needed was in there, except how to divide. There is no mention whatsoever in that manual of how to perform any kind of division operation, <em>but</em>, tacked in the back of the 1980 edition MCS-48 handbook, I found this:</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv.png"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-623x800.png" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-623x800.png 623w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-233x300.png 233w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-117x150.png 117w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-768x987.png 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-1195x1536.png 1195w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv.png 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"></a><figcaption>Woohoo! A working divide routine for MCS-48. It wouldn’t OCR, so I typed it up.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately that routine only has an 8-bit quotient, which isn’t much use for my application because it would overflow in most cases.</p>



<p>I was easily able to work around that with the following implementation (pseudo code):</p>



<pre><code>if (celsius &lt; 0)
{   // If negative, note it, and make it positive
    // so we can work with simpler unsigned routines below
    celsius = -celsius;
    is_negative = 1;
}

fahrenheit = multiply_16x8r16(celsius, 9);

// Divide by 50 so the result of divide_16x8r8 doesn't overflow
fahrenheit = divide_16x8r8(fahrenheit, 50, &amp;remainder);

// Multiply it back up
fahrenheit = multiply_16x8r16(fahrenheit, 10);

// Factor remainder
remainder = multiply_16x8r16(remainder, 10);

// Divide and add remainder
fahrenheit += divide_16x8r8(remainder, 50, NULL);

if (is_negative)
{   // Make it negative again, if it was previously
    is_negative = 1;
}

// Add 32. Requires a 16-bit add with wrap around to
// correctly handle negative temperatures
fahrenheit += 320</code></pre>



<p>While that does the job, it’s poo poo. What I really want is that complicated looking divide routine to have a 16-bit quotient, so I can do the division in a single operation. To help me understand it, I translated it to C code:</p>



<pre><code>uint8_t mcs48_divide(uint16_t dividend, uint8_t divisor, uint8_t *remainder)
{
    if ((dividend &gt;&gt; 8) &gt;= divisor)
        goto mcs48_div_exit; // Impossible. Result would
                             // overflow. Bail.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) // One pass for each bit of result
    {
        uint8_t msb;
        uint8_t bit15_was_set = 0;

        if (dividend &amp; 0x8000)
            bit15_was_set = 1; // Note if this was set,

        dividend &lt;&lt;= 1; // Next bit

        msb = (dividend &gt;&gt; 8);
        if (msb &gt;= divisor || bit15_was_set)
        {
            // Subtract remainder from MSB,
            // preserve and increment quotient
            dividend = (((msb - divisor) &lt;&lt; 8) | (dividend &amp; 0xFF)) + 1;
        }
    }

mcs48_div_exit:
    *remainder = (dividend &gt;&gt; 8);
    return (dividend &amp; 0xFF);
}</code></pre>



<p>It’s immediately clear that it’s a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Divide-Binary-Numbers">binary division</a> implementation. What wasn’t immediately clear is how to make the change I wanted. I put the question to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64544654/can-anyone-figure-out-how-to-extend-this-software-divide-routine-to-have-a-16-bi/64549557#64549557">stack overflow</a>, and on the face of it, it looked like a dumb question, i.e. just double the integer type sizes, <em>stupid</em>. predictably I got punished with a bunch of down-votes.</p>



<p>Yes we can do that, but it’s not what I want to do to the assembly routine that I’m trying to modify, so perhaps I didn’t quite ask the question as well as I could have done. The answer provided sent me in the right direction, in that the working accumulator needs to be larger, 24-bits in my case, and the 16-bit shift needs to be a 24-bit.</p>



<pre><code>uint16_t mcs48_div16(uint16_t dividend, uint8_t divisor, uint8_t *remainder)
{
    uint32_t accumulator = dividend;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) // One pass for each bit of result
    {
        uint8_t msb;
        uint8_t bit24_was_set = 0;

        if (accumulator &amp; 0x800000)
            bit24_was_set = 1; // Note if this was set,
                               // can't check if after shift.

        accumulator &lt;&lt;= 1; // Next bit
        accumulator &amp;= 0xFFFFFF; // Simulate 24 bit type

        msb = (accumulator &gt;&gt; 16);
        if (msb &gt;= divisor || bit24_was_set)
        {
            // Subtract remainder from MSB,
            // preserve and increment quotient
            accumulator = (((msb - divisor) &lt;&lt; 16) | (accumulator &amp; 0xFFFF)) + 1;
        }
    }

mcs48_div_ext_exit:
    *remainder = (accumulator &gt;&gt; 16);
    return (accumulator &amp; 0xFFFF);
}</code></pre>



<p>Above is the pseudo code of my routine after the changes. In the final implementation registers A, R1 and R2 hold the 24-bit accumulator, so this doesn’t translate too well to C because there isn’t a 24-bit integer type.</p>



<p>The final changes to the routine can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/inaxeon/mcs48temp/compare/e006467..a531d32">here</a>.</p>



<p>Ah, that’s better.</p>

    <p>The other day, I was watching Bryan Cantrill’s 2018 talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM">Rust, and Other Interesting Things</a>, and he made an offhanded comment while discussing values of different programming languages and communities. He said, “If you get the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">awk programming language manual</a>…you’ll read it in about two hours and then you’re done. That’s it. You know all of awk.”</p>

<p>Only two hours to learn an entire language?! …. Challenge accepted!</p>

<p>I had previously used snippets of awk here and there. Most of them were given to me by Stack Overflow answers when googling for niche data file manipulations. But, I did not know enough to successfully write an awk program from scratch. I definitely did not have a real grasp on the language nor its power. And, a couple of hours sounded like a relatively small time investment to learn what Bryan Cantrill said was a language he used three times a day.</p>

<p>It turns out it takes more than two hours to learn awk, and I am by no means an expert… yet (growth mindset!). But, I now know enough to write a little about the essentials. Here goes!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-awk-useful-for">What is awk useful for?</h3>

<p>Awk is useful for data file manipulation. Already, having used it for a few days only, I wish I had invested time in learning it earlier. My usual workflow when encountering a data file is to import it into Google Sheets and use their builtin functions. If those weren’t enough, I would write little code snippets to somewhat awk..wardly get the information I want. Awk is way more powerful than what I was doing before. Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="running-awk-programs">Running awk programs</h3>

<p>If we’re going to learn awk, we need to know how to run an awk program. The syntax to run an awk program in a shell is:</p>

<p>We can also write a longer awk program to run instead of writing the awk code inline. We could write a file with awk codeand then pass inline to awk with <code>-f &lt;awk-program-filename&gt;</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-f</span> awk-program.awk data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="awk-program-contents">awk program contents</h3>

<p>Well, what is an awk program? We know it is best used for simple data reformatting or manipulation. The way it does this is by performing different actions on different patterns within a data file. The basic syntax of an awk program depends on these pattern and actions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can give as many <code>pattern { action }</code> pairs as we want. Each pair will be executed independently of the others. This means if a line matches more than one pattern, it will have more than one corresponding action. In the example above we use newlines to separate distinct pairs. Similar to bash, we can also use <code>;</code> to separate commands and put everything on one line: <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action }</code></p>

<h3 id="awk-with-data-files">awk with data files</h3>

<p>But, it turns out awk is much more useful (and fun!) with a data file. The UN has a few <a href="https://data.un.org/">publicly available datasets</a>. I picked <a href="https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_309_201906_Education.csv">this one</a> on education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels to delve into first.</p>

<p>Let’s start by using awk to get a sense of what the data looks like.  <code>NR</code> is a predefined variable which records the number of rows read in a file so far. We can use it to look at the first few lines of a program. In this case, our pattern will be <code>NR &lt;= 5</code>, and by not including an action, the implied action will be <code>print</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>,,,,,
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Students enrolled <span>in </span>primary education <span>(</span>thousands<span>)</span>,<span>"678,991.6070"</span>,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollement ratio - Primary <span>(</span>male<span>)</span>,104.9360,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollment ratio - Primary <span>(</span>female<span>)</span>,99.9214,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Okay, so looks like this is giving us a bit of information about our file. Notably:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are two header rows: a title row, and a row telling us what the fields are</li>
  <li>The file is comma separated</li>
  <li>… except there are sometimes commas within double quoted strings: <code>"Total, all countries or areas"</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s address these one by one!</p>



<p>We can ignore the first two header rows by using our nifty <code>NR</code> moving forward. We can pattern match that <code>NR &gt; 2</code>. Note: awk is 1-indexed.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &gt; 2'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="field-separators">Field Separators</h3>

<p>awk’s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Default-Field-Splitting">default field separator</a> is a space. We can actually see this by printing the first field. To access the value of a field, we use <code>$&lt;field_index&gt;</code>. So <code>$1</code> is the first field, <code>$2</code> the second, and so on. <code>$0</code> refers to the entire row.</p>

<p>If we try this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,"</span>Total,
1,<span>"Total,
1,"</span>Total,
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>we can confirm that we’re splitting on spaces. awk has the option to specify a different field separator with the <code>-F 'separator'</code> flag:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07
Region/Country/Area
1
1
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! But…. we had commas embedded within strings with double quotes. Sure enough, if we print the second field (<code>$2</code>), we see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary

"</span>Total
<span>"Total
"</span>Total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmmm. What we want here is to split fields by <em>content</em>. Which awk does not have, but gawk (GNU awk) does: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Splitting-By-Content">FPAT</a>! From the gawk manual: “All properly written awk programs should work with gawk. So most of the time, we don’t distinguish between gawk and other awk implementations.”</p>

<p>Sounds like we can use gawk here instead then. Let’s try pattern matching. I’m not going to go into regex here, but the pattern we want, defined by <code>"[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\""</code> is anything that either starts with a non-comma character, or starts with a double quote, contains only non-quote characters, and ends with a double quote:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gawk <span>'BEGIN { FPAT = "[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\"" } NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>

<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I snuck a <code>BEGIN</code> in there without explaining it. Let’s go on a brief tangent…</p>

<h3 id="begin--tangent-">BEGIN { tangent }</h3>

<p>Beyond the pattern and actions, awk also has a concept of <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> blocks. The <code>BEGIN</code> is executed before any of the data is processed. It can be useful for declaring variables or printing text to appear at the beginning. Analogously, the <code>END</code> is executed after the data is processed. It can be useful for performing manipulations on aggregates of the data, like averaging a sum.</p>

<p>This means if we wanted to write a little “Hello, awk!” program, we could do it without even needing a data file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'BEGIN { print "Hello, awk!" }'</span>
Hello, <span>awk</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="end--tangent-">END { tangent }</h3>

<p>…back to our example. In our case, we used a <code>BEGIN</code> block to declare the <code>FPAT</code> <em>before</em> reading our data file.</p>

<p>But, we’ve only looked at the first 5 lines. For all we know, the rest of the file could look completely different. Let’s use <code>NR</code> again to see some more of the file. First, let’s figure out how long the file is. We can use the <code>END</code> block here. After we’ve parsed the whole file, we can see what the value of <code>NR</code> is, and that’ll tell us how many lines it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'END { print NR }'</span> education.csv
8630
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so maybe if we print every 500 lines, we’ll get a sense of what data we’re looking at. We can set our pattern to be only if <code>NR</code> is a multiple of <code>500</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR % 500 == 0'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and I’m going to leave this blog post on a real cliff hanger. Mostly because it already feels too long! There’s <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/awk-part-2">a second post</a> about awk actually looking at the data and manipulating it to figure out which countries have stark differences in number of males and females that they educate.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-or-tlskimmed-far-enough-to-get-here-please-give-me-the-shorter-version">TL;DR or TL;Skimmed far enough to get here, please give me the shorter version:</h3>
<p>To rehash what we’ve learned about awk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>awk is run using <code>awk 'awk_program' data-file</code></li>
  <li>awk programs have the form <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action };</code></li>
  <li><code>BEGIN</code> blocks are executed before reading data files</li>
  <li><code>END</code> blocks are executed after reading data files</li>
  <li><code>NR</code> is a variable that tells us the number of rows read</li>
  <li><code>-F '&lt;separator&gt;'</code> is how we can define a field separator for a file</li>
  <li>Space is the default field separator</li>
  <li><code>FPAT="..."</code> is a way to use regex to define a pattern for each field</li>
  <li><code>FPAT</code> is only defined in gawk</li>
</ul>

    <p>I’ve just watched the talk «Nailing Your First Launch» (MicroConf Starter 2018) by Adam Wathan and I
took notes that I’d like to share and re-visit them in the future. Some of them are just text from his screens, some thoughts are mine.</p>
<p>But don’t let me steal the video from you by providing a digested summary.
In my humble opinion, the main idea of watching talks or reading something is to change your mind
model of seeing this topic.
Don’t hesitate and start watching the video before proceeding to notes.
The notes are here just to come back from time to time and re-call some especially useful highlights.</p>

<h3 id="one-time-purchase-products-are-way-easier-to-sell">One-time purchase products are way easier to sell</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harder to convince people that for $9 dollars per month they’d have value.</li>
<li>But it’s a very frequent case when people buy $100 courses and don’t even watch them.</li>
<li>One-time payments are much easier to go away with.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-can-be-done">They can be “done”</h3>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to maintain them forever.</li>
<li>A course can be finished. A book can be finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="you-can-put-one-together-in-3-months-of-nights-and-weekends">You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easier to plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-put-money-in-the-bank-fast-then-drop-off-opposite-to-saas">They put money in the bank fast then drop off (opposite to SAAS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>One-time projects do have a more clear cliff of death, but they produce more money than saas during
launch days.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="building-an-audience">Building an audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having a big audience can compensate for almost any mistake made in marketing/sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huge audience + bad sales plan produces way more profit than no audience + good sales plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce blog posts, tutorials, podcasts, screencasts, interview people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be worth following (provide a value for your audience)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help people where they already are (Wes Bos)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific tactics for tech guys: tweet your hacks (like some tricks with css) that save you time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="picking-the-right-idea">Picking the right idea</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have an idea
<ul>
<li>what are you already putting out there that peoeple seem excited about?</li>
<li>what are you excited about that you think others will get excited about?</li>
<li>what do people think you’re better at than they are?</li>
<li>what have you learned outside your community would benefit from?</li>
<li>what did you have to figure out yourself but was really helpful to learn?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test it
<ul>
<li>
<p>«First thing to do is to put a landing page and start emailing.»</p>
<p>It’s not a bad way, but it’s not the first thing that you should do.
Especially it doesn’t work if you have no audience. People wouldn’t trust you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Collect feedback from tweets, have a catalog of them. Can be used later for your landing/sales pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="define-the-product">Define the product</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan small, it will end up bigger than you think anyway
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry about size. A short book is still a book.</li>
<li>3 hours of a video course is plenty.</li>
<li>Actually, not everyone is looking for a full knowledge base on a specific topic and read
500 pages on that. Collection of great ideas (like tweets) on that specific topic works
too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, courses are easier to sell at higher prices because people expect products such as
books to be in a specific cost range, even if they understand that it brings a high value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="landing-page">Landing page</h3>
<p>The goal is to collect e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Example of Adam’s landing page can be seen on 19:33 - 22:25</p>
<ul>
<li>Promise something in advance (sign up for free screencasts and a big discount)</li>
<li>You can put your catalog of feedback on your landing page to earn more trust.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pre-sell">Pre-sell</h3>
<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Best form of product validation</li>
<li>You’ll make more money</li>
<li>More motivation to finish</li>
<li>Can buy you the time to focus on the product</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Selling multiple tiers is trickier</li>
<li>Can’t easily change scope</li>
<li>Like taking on debt, can be extremely stressful. People paid you 50k$ and you have to return
it as the value in N months. (impostor syndrome?)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-your-email-list">Building Your Email List</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always tell your audience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Announce the announcement — «about to announce the next big project I’m working on; if you check
it out and are excited about it, I’d love any help spreading the word!»</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Share progress. Send an update every week or so.</li>
<li>Repurpose content (Take a chapter from a book, make it a blog post and share it)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-it-finished">Getting it finished</h3>
<p>A few strategies to finally finish it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make promises («this week I’m going to deliver a screencast»)</li>
<li>Email on a schedule</li>
<li>Reduce scope. (the project/book gets bigger and bigger, the best way to cross the finish line</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="figuring-pricing">Figuring pricing</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard to sell tiers during pre-sales.</li>
<li>Sell pre-orders with top tier price.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="single-tier">Single tier</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can be fine if you can charge enough</li>
<li>Often necessary if pre-selling</li>
<li>Nice if you can’t figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable</li>
<li>In general, prefer multiple tiers</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="two-tiers">Two tiers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Usually a price anchoring strategy, first tier makes second tier look like better deal</li>
<li>Second tier is usually the “real” product</li>
<li>Prices are often close-ish, maybe 1x and 1.5x</li>
<li>Works well with video courses where easy to cut content for budget version</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="three-tiers">Three tiers:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content (videos?)</li>
<li>Makes it easier to evaluate as its own product instead of compring to Amazon book prices</li>
<li>Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, ~5x</li>
<li>This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Adam’s case</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First tier: The Bare Essentials, $39
<ul>
<li>The 158-page book in pdf format</li>
<li>Comprehensive set of exercises</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second tier: The Premium Training Package, $79
<ul>
<li>Over 4 hours of screencasts, covering all of the book examples</li>
<li>Three additional advanced tutorials</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all from first tier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third tier: The complete Reference Package, $179
<ul>
<li>The source code of Nitpick CI, a production Laravel application that makes heavy
use of collection pipelines</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all from second tier</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="launch-discounts">Launch discounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%</li>
<li>Use stepped discounts; lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers</li>
<li>Reverse engineer non-discounted price from your planned discounted price, it’ll help you charge more</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nailing-the-launch">Nailing the launch</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build the sales page 39:13</p>
<ul>
<li>Still include an email sign up that sends preview content for new traffic (sign up to get
four free preview lessons)</li>
<li>Testimonials and social proof are important; use feedback from preview content to start</li>
<li>Sort tiers from highest price to lower price, use visuals to communicate value of higher
tiers (ui/ux hacks, make more important text bold, more physical things on a picture)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Announce the launch details</p>
<ul>
<li>Include all package and pricing details</li>
<li>Complete TOC or content list</li>
<li>Final free content preview if possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch it</p>
<ul>
<li>Easiest part. Send an email — “xxx is now available!”, include discount</li>
<li>Launch on tuesday, no evidence, but it seems at least as good as any other day for Adam</li>
<li>Morning EST works well too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage early feedback</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect and catalog feedback after the launch.</li>
<li>Send new reviews to other people who hasn’t bought the course/book yet. Send them preview
of another chapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closing the launch</p>
<ul>
<li>Close the discount. Announce closing it. (“Hey, this is the last week of the launch”)</li>
<li>But don’t specify a closing date in advance</li>

<p>I recently created a tool for a client to export some data from a Kafka topic and after waiting about 10 minutes for it to export, the program returned a rather bizarre error:</p>

<pre><code>kafka: error while consuming telemetry/0: kafka server: Message contents does not match its CRC.

</code></pre>

<p>Intuition gave me a bad feeling about that error, but I was not prepared for what was going to come next. I decide to look up the error quickly and the error indicated that the CRC calculated by the consumer was not matching the message header. Huh, what was going on here?</p>

<p>Before I dive into this article, it’s helpful to learn a little bit about the software that was being run when we started running into this problem. We had 3 VMs on an Azure cluster that were running FreeBSD. The producers were using <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/sarama">https://github.com/Shopify/sarama</a> and the consumers were using <a href="https://github.com/bsm/sarama-cluster">https://github.com/bsm/sarama-cluster</a></p>

<p>What’s also interesting is, no matter how many machines we might have had in the cluster (if they were all FreeBSD), we most likely would have experienced failure across the board. This wasn’t really great since the entire point of replicating the cluster across N machines was to prevent complete system failure. In this case, it really wouldn’t have helped us. A tear falls down my cheek for failed distributed programming promises.</p>

<p>A little bit after my export tool ran, I got a ping on Slack that one of the services that uses this Kafka topic was no longer working. I check the logs of that service, and sure enough, the same error:</p>

<pre><code>kafka: error while consuming topic/0: kafka server: Message contents does not match its CRC.

</code></pre>

<p>Because this was a live running service, my first thought was to use the power of Kafka to shift the offset by 1 for this particular consumer so we can skip this corrupt message and get everything running again quickly.</p>

<p><code>kafka-consumer-groups.sh</code> is a command line tool that let’s you do exactly this, except it doesn’t work on <code>kafka-0.10.2</code>. That was a little bit of a surprise to me, I assumed one of the coolest things about Kafka is that you can pick an offset to consume from. The libraries we were using also had no way to manually select an offset to start from.</p>

<p>Okay, crap, so I need to upgrade Kafka to shift the offsets. This is a good opportunity to get on <code>1.0.0</code> anyway and perhaps restarting the services will actually fix the problem. I update my Ansible scripts for <code>kafka 1.0.1</code> and start reading the upgrade guide for a live running environment: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade">https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade</a>.</p>

<p>Great, we’re on <code>1.0.1</code>, but the problem still exists. I have the ability to move the offet over, so I shift the offset by 1.</p>

<pre><code>./kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group "api-consumer-group" --topic "telemetry:0" --reset-offsets --shift-by 1 --execute
</code></pre>

<p>I restart the service and the error comes up again. Darn. So it’s not only one message that is corrupt, it’s a range, that’s not great. I decided to commit to this strategy because this service needed to be up and running for a live demo in the coming week.</p>

<p>So instead, my idea was to shift the offset by a larger number until I find a number that actually works. Once I find a number that works, I can do a manual binary search to find the exact offset where the corruption started and shift it by 1.</p>

<p>After doing a manual binary search, I have found that the corrupted records are between <code>23769420-23772231</code> inclusive and corrupted, so good messages begin at <code>23772232</code> so 2811 corrupted messages. I run <code>./kafka-consumer-groups.sh</code> again, but this time I specify the exact offset to start from instead of using <code>shift-by</code></p>

<p>I restart the service again, and it works! Great, let’s hope this monkey patch works until the live demo. Nope, the next day, the same message appears again.</p>

<p>At this point, I’ve had my fair share of complicated problems, and I have a deep gut instinct that it’s most likely not the code we’ve written because the problem started to appear on multiple other topics in the cluster and the problem was produced by multiple independent services.</p>

<p>Of course, the book Pragmatic Programmer still pops up in my head:</p>

<p><em>“select” Isn’t Broken</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I focus on starting from the application and then working outwards, I upgrade our libraries used in our code. I upgrade Sarama to <code>1.6.0</code> and I upgrade <code>sarama-cluster</code> to <code>master</code>. I run our deployment scripts and everything is running again.</p>

<p>I do the ridiculous offset binary-search trick again to shift everything and sure enough the issue comes up again with our Kafka libraries upgraded to the latest version. I decide to look at the logs of the broker themslelves and this is what I see;</p>

<pre><code>[2018-03-17 20:11:58,551] ERROR [ReplicaFetcher replicaId=1, leaderId=3, fetcherId=0] Error for partition telemetry-0 to broker 3:org.apache.kafka.common.errors.CorruptRecordException: This message has failed its CRC checksum, exceeds the valid size, or is otherwise corrupt. (kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)
[2018-03-17 20:11:58,747] ERROR [ReplicaFetcher replicaId=1, leaderId=2, fetcherId=0] Error for partition topic-2 to broker 2:org.apache.kafka.common.errors.CorruptRecordException: This message has failed its CRC checksum, exceeds the valid size, or is otherwise corrupt. (kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at that error message, it appears that the replica thread inside of Kafka is running into exactly the same problem as our consumers. Uh oh, at this point I know it’s definitely not our application code, so much for that Pragmatic Programmer tip, gut instinct all the way!</p>

<p>There is a Kafka tool to let’s you see deeper into the health of your cluster <code>./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --describe</code>. Here’s the output:</p>

<pre><code>Topic:telemetry PartitionCount:6 ReplicationFactor:3 Configs:
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 0 Leader: 2 Replicas: 2,1,3 Isr: 2
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 1 Leader: 3 Replicas: 3,2,1 Isr: 3
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 2 Leader: 1 Replicas: 1,3,2 Isr: 1
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 3 Leader: 2 Replicas: 2,3,1 Isr: 2
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 4 Leader: 3 Replicas: 3,1,2 Isr: 3
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 5 Leader: 1 Replicas: 1,2,3 Isr: 1
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at the <code>Isr</code> column, it stands for <code>In-Sync</code> replica. It appears that this cluster is not healthy because only the leader broker is in sync while all the other brokers cannot replicate that partition. Our goal here is to get that <code>Isr</code> column back to <code>1,2,3</code>.</p>

<p>So at this point, here are the options:</p>

<ul>
<li>- Hardware failure, such as disk failure, or network connectivity issues.</li>
<li>- The cluster is misbehaving because of resource allocation issues, perhaps it’s going OOM, or we’re out disk space.</li>
<li>- A bug with the Kafka version we were using</li>
<li>- An OpenJDK bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I decide to quickly look into our various servers to see if this is a resource allocation issue that is causing Kafka to misbehave. This was a red herring, one of the servers that was responsible for pushing to this topic actually filled its root partition and for a second I thought that might have been the issue, but that issue was fixed and the issue still remained.</p>

<p>The actual Kafka instances seemed to be fine, they were nowhere near capacity in terms of disk space, and the chances of having hardware failure across 3 machines was unlikely.</p>

<p>it gets a little confusing on what could be wrong and I start to realize that this is becoming a difficult problem and we have to get this live system working. I can’t just adjust things at random and hope that the problem is fixed. It’s time to dig deeper, it’s time to look at what Kafka is actually writing to disk.</p>

<h3 id="digging-deeper">Digging deeper</h3>

<p>Kafka writes the messages it receives into a log folder. The log folder contains a folder for each topic and partition combo. This is how it might look for this particular topic we’re having issues with:</p>

<p>The <code>.log</code> file is where the messages we push to Kafka are stored. We’re going to attempt to extract the offset that is corrupt to see what exactly is corrupt about it. If you’re curious on learning about the internals of Kafka, check out this article, it was a lot simpler than I thought: <a href="https://thehoard.blog/how-kafkas-storage-internals-work-3a29b02e026">https://thehoard.blog/how-kafkas-storage-internals-work-3a29b02e026</a></p>

<p>Kafka provides a tool, <code>kafka.tools.DumpLogSegments</code> that lets you dive into these log files and grab more details about individual records that are in the file. Hilariously enough, when I ran this tool, it bails right when it hits a corrupt message.</p>

                <p>Java <code>Thread</code> objects allow us to run our code in separate threads. When an application starts JVM creates the initial thread named <code>main</code>. The main method is run on the main thread. Inside the application we can create new threads to execute other tasks in parallel with the main thread.</p><p>Java uses native operating system threads. So one java thread is mapped by one OS thread.</p><h3 id="creating-threads">Creating Threads</h3><p>The constructor of the <code>Thread</code> class takes a <code>Runnable</code> object. Runnable interface has an abstract <code>run</code> method which is called by <code>Thread#start()</code> method. It object can be instantiated by a lambda, anonymous class or a class which implements Runnable method. </p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-29-at-20.03.52.png"></figure><p>Using lambdas are generally easier and more compact:</p><pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
    // content of run command
});
thread.start();</code></pre><p>Thread lives as long as the its run hook method has not returned. The scheduler can suspend and run the Thread many times. For a thread to execute forever, it needs an infinite loop that prevents it from returning. </p><p><code>Join</code> method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. This is a simple form of barrier synchronisation.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-29-at-20.19.19.png"></figure><h3 id="java-thread-types-user-and-daemon-threads">Java Thread Types: User and Daemon Threads</h3><p>When JVM start it contains a single User thread, named Main thread. The main difference between User and Daemon threads are what happens when they exit.</p><ul><li>A user thread continues its lifecycle even if the main thread exits.</li><li>However all Daemon threads terminates when all the user threads exits.</li><li>JVM itself exits when all the user threads has exited.</li></ul><p>Thread class contains boolean <code>daemon</code> field to specify whether the thread is daemon. It can be set at the time of creation by the constructor or by setter method.</p><pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread(getRunnable());
thread.setDaemon(true);
thread.start();</code></pre><p>By default daemon field is false, so most of the Threads that we generate is a User Thread. Threads copy the <code>isDaemon</code> status of the parent threat if it is not specified. Java uses Daemon thread in some places such as <code>ForkJoinPool</code> and <code>Timer</code>. To illustrate we can use the following example:</p><pre><code>public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
//        runDeamonThread();
        runUserThread();
        System.out.println(getCurrentThreadName() + " exits");
    }

    private static void runDeamonThread() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newWorkStealingPool(10);
        executorService.execute(getRunnable());
    }

    private static void runUserThread() {
        Thread thread = new Thread(getRunnable());
        thread.start();
    }

    private static Runnable getRunnable() {
        return () -&gt; {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 200; i++) {
                System.out.print(".");
                Thread.yield();
            }
            System.out.println(getCurrentThreadName() + " exits. isDeamon: " + isDaemon());
        };
    }

    private static boolean isDaemon() {
        return Thread.currentThread().isDaemon();
    }

    private static String getCurrentThreadName() {
        return Thread.currentThread().getName();
    }
}</code></pre><ul><li>When we invoke <code>runUserThread</code> method it show the following example output:</li></ul><pre><code>................................................
main exits
........................................................................................
Thread-0 exits. isDeamon: false</code></pre><ul><li>The second case is invoking the <code>runDeamonThread</code> which uses <code>ForkJoinPool</code> as an example of Daemon Threads. I could simply use <code>setDaemon(true)</code> method, but wanted to give an example usage. Output:</li></ul><pre><code>main exits</code></pre><p>So when the main method exits, all the user threads are terminated and JVM exits and kills all daemon threads, so that we did not even have a chance to see output from daemon threads.</p><h3 id="stopping-threads">Stopping Threads</h3><p>Compared to creating, stopping a thread is quite hard thing. Once thread starts running it diverges from the caller and it has it is own lifecycle anymore. It can either complete the task and exits or if it does a long running operation it can work forever. Java does not provides us a method (non-deprecated) to stop the thread voluntarily. </p><ol><li>A naive approach could be using a stop flag:</li></ol><pre><code>volatile boolean isStopped = false;

public void test() {
    new Thread(() -&gt; {
        while (!isStopped) {
            System.out.print(".");
        }
        System.out.println("Child Exits");
    }).start();

    try {
        Thread.sleep(100);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    isStopped = true;
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>Note that the flag is <code>volatile</code> in order to make its up-to-date value visible for both threads. However this approach fails if the thread is doing blocking operations such as <code>sleep</code>, <code>wait</code>, <code>join</code> or blocking I/O operations.</p><p>2. Another way to stop the tread is to use <code>interrupt()</code> method of the thread. </p><blockquote>An interrupt request to a thread is an indication that it should stop what it is doing and do something else. It is up to the programmer to decide exactly how a thread responds to an interrupt but it is very common for the tread to terminate.</blockquote><p>For the interrupt mechanism to work correctly, the interrupted thread must support its own interruption mechanism. There are 2 cases we can examine for interruption:</p><ul><li>Non Blocking and Long Running Tasks</li></ul><p>In this case calling the <code>thread.interrupt()</code> method will set the interrupt flag of the that thread but if the task itself does not check the status of the interrupted flag it will not have any impact. For example:</p><pre><code>public void test() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Child Starts");
        while (true) {
            System.out.print(".");
        }
    });

    thread.start();
    thread.interrupt();
    
    thread.join();
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>In order for the thread to catch the interrupt, it should iteratively check the status of the interrupt flag so that it can understand if there are any pending interruption request and handle the request accordingly. </p><p>So we can check the flag in our while loop in if it is true we can return or break the loop. In the lambda expression it is not possible to throw an exception but in appropriate places we can throw <code>InterruptedException</code> as well.</p><pre><code>public void test() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Child Starts");
        while (true) {
            if (Thread.interrupted()) {
                break;
            }
            System.out.print(".");
        }
        System.out.println("Child exits");
    });

    thread.start();
    thread.interrupt();

    thread.join();
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>Note the <code>Thread.interrupted()</code> method returns the value of the flag and clears it if it has been true. So if we want to keep the state of the Thread as interrupted for the upper level of stack, we can set it back with <code>Thread.currentThread().interrupt();</code> </p><ul><li>Blocking Tasks</li></ul><p>If a thread frequently calls the blocking methods such as <code>wait</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>sleep</code>, <code>blocking I/O</code> which are all run interruptively, these methods internally check if they have been interrupted and if so they automatically throw <code>InterruptedException</code>. This exception should be caught and handled in the appropriate context. The following example uses the interruption to break the loop in a blocking <code>sleep</code> operation:</p><pre><code>public void test() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Child Starts");
        try {
            while (true) {
                Thread.sleep(10000);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.println("Child Exits");
    });

    thread.start();
    thread.interrupt();

    thread.join();
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>There are patterns for dealing with Java <code>InterruptedException</code>:</p><ul><li>One approach is propagating the exception to the callers, so higher layer would be responsible.</li><li>Before re-throwing, we can do task specific clean up.</li><li>If it is not possible to re-throw, we can set the interrupted status to true again with <code>Thread.currentThread().interrupt()</code> to preserve the evidence if the higher layers want to check it.</li></ul><p>So as a conclusion if we want to implement cancellable tasks we need to periodically check the status of the interrupt status and handle the interruption in a way that thread will exit.</p><h3 id="thread-groups">Thread Groups</h3><p>In order to simplify thread management, multiple threads &nbsp;can be organised with <code>java.lang.ThreadGroup</code> objects that group related threads. Each Thread Group needs to have a parent group. In the hierarchy, there is the <code>Main</code> group which is the parent of the other groups or threads we create in the program. We can create <code>ThreadGroup</code> by calling its constructor with a parent group and/or name. To add the Threads in a group we need to specify the group in the Thread's constructor.</p><pre><code>public void test() {
    ThreadGroup tg1 = new ThreadGroup("Thread-group-1");
    ThreadGroup tg2 = new ThreadGroup(tg1, "Thread-group-2");

    Thread thread1 = new Thread(tg1,"thread-1");
    Thread thread2 = new Thread(tg2,"thread-2");
    Thread thread3 = new Thread(tg2,"thread-3");

    thread1.start();
    thread2.start();
    thread3.start();
    
    Thread[] threads = new Thread[tg2.activeCount()];
    tg2.enumerate(threads);

    Arrays.asList(threads).forEach(t -&gt; System.out.println(t.getName()));
    tg1.list();
}</code></pre><p>We can iterate over the threads by calling the <code>enumerate</code> method, which fills the given array with the thread references of the group.</p><p>We can implement a Thread Pool by making use of Thread Groups:</p><pre><code>public class ThreadPool {
    // Create a thread group field
    private final ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("ThreadPoolGroup");
    // Create a LinkedList field containing Runnable
    private final List&lt;Runnable&gt; tasks = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();

    public ThreadPool(int poolSize) {
   …</code></pre></div></div>

October 30, 2020 | https://antmedia.io/cmaf-is-available-in-ant-media-server-v2-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antmedia.io/cmaf-is-available-in-ant-media-server-v2-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We’re happy to announce that Ant Media Server v2.2 is out with CMAF support. Before giving more highlights for the new version, just let us thank all you guys out there that make Ant Media Server become a worldwide product in 121 countries. It’s great to help lots of people around the world for their video streaming projects. After this introduction, let me give the highlights for the v2.2.</p>
<h2>Low Latency (CMAF) vs. Ultra Low Latency (WebRTC)</h2>
<p>Ant Media Server right now supports both LL(CMAF) and ULL(WebRTC). Here is the some basic information about these technologies. CMAF provides low latency(3-5 secs) in live streaming, on the other hand WebRTC provides Ultra Low Latency(0.5 secs) in live streaming. Then which one is good for your streaming project, CMAF or WebRTC?</p>
<h4>Which one to use?</h4>
<p>Both technologies have advantages and disadvantages. You can pick the correct one according to your use case.&nbsp; CMAF is good if there is no interactivity between broadcasters and viewers. It’s easier to scale with CMAF with CDNs.&nbsp; It’s not much affected by instant network fluctuations because latency is about 3-5 seconds. On the other hand,&nbsp; it’s good to use WebRTC if there is interactivity between broadcasters and viewers. You need to manage the edge WebRTC servers to scale.&nbsp; It’s affected by instant network fluctuations(jitter, congestion) because it’s about 0.5 secs latency.</p>
<div id="attachment_34297"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34297" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF.png" alt="CMAF" width="626" height="347" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF.png 626w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF-300x166.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF-600x333.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" title="Adventure Continues: CMAF is available in Ant Media Server v2.2 1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-34297">CMAF</p></div><h4>How to use CMAF?</h4>
<p>Firstly, you need to enable it on your application’s configuration file. Let’s assume that you’ve already running Ant Media Server v.2.2 Enterprise on your server then we’re going to use WebRTCAppEE for CMAF streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the following file with your favorite editor <pre>/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties</pre> </li>
<li>Enable DASH by adding following property to the file above <pre>settings.dashMuxingEnabled=true</pre> </li>
<li>Restart the Ant Media Server <pre>sudo service antmedia restart</pre> </li>
<li>Send WebRTC stream to Ant Media Server on WebRTC publisher page. Let’s assume your stream id is “stream1” <pre>https://YOUR_DOMAIN:5443/WebRTCAppEE</pre> </li>
<li>Play the stream with CMAF on the following url <pre>https://YOUR_DOMAIN:5443/WebRTCAppEE/play.html?id=stream1&amp;playOrder=dash</pre> </li>
</ul>
<p>Measure the latency. You’ll see something between 3-5 secs. Let us give further configuration parameters for DASH muxing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>settings.dashSegDuration </em>: Duration of segments in DASH. Default value is 2</li>
<li><em>settings.dashFragmentDuration </em>: Duration of fragments. Default value is 0.5</li>
<li><em>settings.dashTargetLatency </em>: Target latency for measurement. Default value is 3.5.</li>
<li><em>settings.dashWindowSize </em>:&nbsp; DASH window size. Number of files in manifest. Default value is 5</li>
<li><em>settings.dashExtraWindowSize </em>: DASH extra window size. Number of segments kept outside of the manifest before removing from disk. Default value is 5</li>
<li><em>settings.deleteDASHFilesOnEnded </em>: Delete DASH files after streaming is ended.&nbsp; Default value is true</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kubernetes Support</h2>
<p>We’ve been getting requests for supporting Kubernetes(K8s) from our users for a while. So that we’ve decided to support Kubernetes in Ant Media Server. We’ve added extra parameters to start the server in the container.</p>
<div id="attachment_34272"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34272" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kubernetes.png" alt="Adventure Continues: CMAF is available in Ant Media Server v2.2 1" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kubernetes.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kubernetes-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Adventure Continues: CMAF is available in Ant Media Server v2.2 2"></p><p id="caption-attachment-34272">Kubernetes is supported in Ant Media Server</p></div><p>Moreover, we’ve prepared the documentation for the Kubernetes. All kubernetes files(service, deployment) and dockerFile are available <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Ant-Media-Server-Kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the documentation.</a> The critical thing for running Ant Media Server is that deployment uses hostNetwork which means that you can use one Ant Media Server pod in a node.</p>
<h2>Long live the new King: Java 11</h2>
<p>We don’t mean the “The king is dead” because Java 8 is still the most used Java version. On the other hand, for compatibility with tools and improvements in Java 11, we’ve migrated to Java 11 in Ant Media Server. In addition, we’ve monitored some performance improvements on Java 11. We plan to provide more performance metrics for this release later.&nbsp; All install scripts and docker files are updated to use Java 11.</p>

<![CDATA[For Complex Applications, Rust Is as Productive as Kotlin]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>In this article, we will compare one apple (IntelliJ Rust) to one orange (rust-analyzer) to reach general and sweeping conclusions.
Specifically, I want to present a case study supporting the following claim:</p>
<p>For complex applications, Rust is as productive as Kotlin.</p>
<p>For me, this is an unusual claim to argue: I always thought exactly the opposite, but I am not so sure now.
I came to Rust from C++.
I was of the opinion that this is a brilliant low-level language and always felt puzzled at people writing higher-level things in Rust.
Clearly, choosing Rust means taking a productivity hit, and using Kotlin, C# or Go just makes much more sense if you can afford GC.
My <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">list of Rust criticisms</a> starts with this objection.</p>
<p>What moved my position in the other direction was my experience as the lead developer of rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust.
Let me introduce the two projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><strong>IntelliJ Rust</strong></a> is the plugin for IntelliJ Platform, providing Rust support.
In effect, it is a Rust compiler front-end, written in Kotlin and making use of language-support features of the platform.
These features include lossless syntax trees, a parser generator, persistence and indexing infrastructure, among others.
Nonetheless, as programming languages differ lot, the bulk of logic for analyzing Rust is implemented in the plugin itself.
Presentational features like completion list come from the platform, but most of the language semantics is hand-written.
IntelliJ Rust also includes a bit of a Swing GUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer"><strong>rust-analyzer</strong></a> is an implementation of
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Rust.
It is a Rust compiler front-end written from scratch with an eye towards IDE support.
It makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">salsa</a> library for incremental computations.
Beyond the compiler itself, rust-analyzer includes code for managing long-lived multithreaded process of the language server itself.</p>
<p>The projects are essentially equivalent in scope — rust compiler front-ends suitable for IDEs.
The two biggest differences are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IntelliJ Rust is a plugin, so it can re-use code and design patterns of the surrounding platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rust-analyzer is the second system, so it leverages experience of IntelliJ Rust for a from-scratch design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The internal architecture of the two projects also differs a lot.
In terms of <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">Three Architectures</a>, IntelliJ Rust is map-reduce, and rust-analyzer is query-based.</p>
<p>Writing an IDE-ready compiler is a high-level task.
You don’t need to talk to the operating system directly.
There are some fancy data structures and concurrency here and there, but they are also high-level.
It’s not about implementing crazy lock-free schemes, it’s about maintaining application state and sanity in the multithreaded world.
The bulk of the compiler is symbolic manipulation, arguably best suited for lisp.
Picking a VM-based language for such task (for example, OCaml), doesn’t have any intrinsic downsides.</p>
<p>At the same time, the task is pretty complex and unique.
The ratio of “your code” vs “framework code” when implementing features is much higher than in a typical CRUD backend.</p>
<p>Now that the projects are introduced, lets take two roughly equivalent slices of history.</p>

<p>Both are about 2 years old, with 1-1.5 developers working full time and vibrant and thriving community of open-source contributors.
There are 52k lines of Kotlin and 66k lines of Rust.</p>
<p>Both delivered roughly equivalent feature sets at that time.
To be honest, I still don’t really believe this :)
rust-analyzer started from zero, it didn’t have a decade worth of Java classes to bootstrap from, and the productivity drop between Kotlin and Rust is supposed to be huge.
But it’s hard to argue with reality.
Instead, let me try to reflect on my experience building both, and to try to explain Rust’s surprising productivity.</p>

<p>It’s easy to characterize Kotlin’s learning curve — it is nearly zero.
I’ve started IntelliJ Rust without Kotlin experience and never felt that I need to specifically learn Kotlin.</p>
<p>When I switched to rust-analyzer, I was pretty experienced with Rust.
I would say that one definitely needs to deliberately learn Rust, it’s hard to pick it up on the go.
Ownership and aliasing control are novel concepts (even if you come from C++), and taking holistic approach to learning them pays off.
After the initial learning step the ride is generally smooth.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the perfect place to plug our Rust courses and tailor-made <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/">trainings</a> :-)
The next <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/#package-intro-training">introduction to Rust</a> is happening this December!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_modularity">Modularity</h2>
<div>
<p>This I think is the biggest factor.
Both projects are moderately large in terms of scope as well as in terms of amount of source code.
I believe that the only way to ship big things is to split them in independent-ish chunks and implement the chunks separately.</p>
<p>I also find most of the languages I am familiar with to be pretty horrible with respect to modularity.
More generally, I am amused with FP vs OO debate, as it seems that “why no one does modules right?” is a more salient issue.</p>
<p>Rust is one of the few languages which has first-class concept of libraries.
Rust code is organized on two levels:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as a tree of inter-dependent modules inside a crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as a directed acyclic graph of crates</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Cyclic dependencies are allowed between the modules, but not between the crates.
Crates are units of reuse and privacy: only crate’s public API matters, and it is crystal clear what crate’s public API is.
Moreover, crates are anonymous, so you don’t get name conflicts and dependency hell when mixing several versions of the same crate in a single crate graph.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to make two pieces of code <strong>not</strong> depend on each other (non-dependencies are the essence of modularity): just put them in separate crates.
During code review, only changes to Cargo.tomls need to be monitored carefully.</p>
<p>At the time of comparison, rust-analyzer is split into 23 internal crates, with a handful general-purposed ones released on crates.io.
In contrast, IntelliJ Rust is a single Kotlin module, where everything can depend on everything else.
Although internal organization of IntelliJ Rust is pretty clean, it’s not reflected in the file system layout and build system, and needs constant maintenance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_build_system">Build System</h2>
<div>
<p>Managing project’s build takes significant amount of times, and has multiplicative effect on everything else.</p>
<p>Rust’s build system, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a>, is very good.
It’s not perfect, but it is a breath of fresh air after Java’s <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo’s trick is that it doesn’t try to be a general purpose build system.
It can only build Rust projects, and it has rigid expectation about the project structure.
It’s impossible to opt out of the core assumptions.
Configuration is a static non-extensible TOML file.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gradle allows free-form project structure, and is configured via a Turing complete language.
I feel like I’ve spend more time learning Gradle than learning Rust!
Running <code>wc -w</code> gives 182_817 words for Rust book, and 280_506 for Gradle’s user guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cargo is just faster than Gradle in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest downside is that custom build logic is not expressible in Cargo.
Both projects needs substantial amount of logic beyond mere compilation to deliver the final result to the user.
For rust-analyzer, this is handled by hand-written Rust script, which works perfectly at this scale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<div>
<p>Language-level support for libraries and top-notch build system/package manager allow for a thriving ecosystem.
rust-analyzer relies on third-party libraries much more than IntelliJ Rust.
Some parts of rust-analyzer are also published to crates.io for other projects to reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-level nature of the Rust programming language often allows for “perfect” library interfaces.
Interfaces which exactly reflect the underlying problem, without imposing intermediate language-level abstractions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_basic_conveniences">Basic Conveniences</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel that Rust is significantly more productive when it comes to basic language nuts and bolts — structs, enums, functions, etc.
This is not specific to Rust — any ML-family language has them.
However, Rust is the first industrial language which wraps these features in a nice package, not constrained by backwards compatibility.
I want to list specific features which I think allow producing maintainable code faster in Rust</p>
<p><em>Emphasis on data over behavior</em>.
Aka, Rust is not an OOP language.
The core idea of OOP is that of dynamic dispatch — which code is invoked by a function call is decided at runtime (late binding).
This is a powerful pattern which allows for flexible and extensible system.
The problem is, extensibility is costly!
It’s better only to apply it in certain designated areas.
Designing for extensibility by default is not cost effective.
Rust puts static dispatch front and center: it is mostly clear whats going on by just reading the code, as it is independent of runtime types of the objects.</p>
<p>One small syntactic thing I enjoy about Rust is how it puts fields and methods into different blocks syntactically:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>first_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
  <span>last_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>full_name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Being able to see at a glance all the fields makes understanding the code much simpler.
Fields convey much more information than methods.</p>
<p><em>Sum types</em>.
Rust’s humbly named enums are full algebraic data types.
This means that you can express the idea of disjoint union:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>),</span> <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is hugely useful in day-to-day programming in the small, and some times during programming in the large as well.
To give one example, one of the core concepts for an IDE are references and definitions.
A definition a like <code>let foo = 92;</code> assigns a name to an entity which can be used down a line.
A reference like <code>foo + 90</code> <em>refers</em> to some definition.
When you ctrl-click on reference, you go to the definition.</p>
<p>Natural way to model that in Kotlin is by adding <code>interface Definition</code> and <code>interface Reference</code>.
The problem is, some things are …</p></div></div></div></div>

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, however, there are many steps to be taken before this finding would lead to a clinical trial.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you are interested in finding out about clinical trials that are underway related to Alzheimer’s you can go to <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/research/participate/node/13200">Participate in Research</a>. There you’ll find a number of studies looking for participants including control subjects, people not living with a specific condition. </span></span></p>

 <p><span><span>On October 25, a developer posted that the SM2 national secret algorithm was finally accepted by the Linux kernel community. </span><span>The author stated that the SM2 patch has been updated to version v7. This version of the patch was finally accepted by the community. It has been </span></span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=Tianjia+Zhang"><span><span>merged into the 5.10-rc1 of the Linux mainline</span></span></a><span><span> . If nothing </span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=Tianjia+Zhang"><span>else</span></a><span> , it will be officially released in the 5.10 kernel version.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>National Secret is the abbreviation of National Commercial Encryption. The National Encryption Administration Bureau formulates algorithm standards, and it also formulates a large number of product and interface specifications and application scenarios. </span><span>Since 2012, the State Cryptography Administration has successively published SM2/SM3/SM4 and other cryptographic algorithm standards and their application specifications in the form of the "People's Republic of China Password Industry Standards". </span><span>Among them, "SM" stands for "commercial secret", which is a cryptographic technology used for commercial use that does not involve state secrets.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>According to the author, the current Linux kernel has well supported the SM3 and SM4 algorithms, thanks to the widespread use of wireless LAN standards. </span><span>However, the SM2 algorithm and the national secret certificate have not been supported for a long time, and it is impossible to establish full-stack trust and integrity verification in the kernel based on the national secret. Therefore, it has become urgent to support this system in the kernel.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>It took 7 rounds for the kernel community to accept SM2. </span><span>The initial consideration was to migrate from openssl, but the openssl architecture and infrastructure code needed to be ported because of the huge workload. </span><span>After several rounds of discussion and testing, I found that the existing libgcrypt already has a complete elliptic curve basic algorithm, so I tried to implement SM2 in libgcrypt first, and finally the SM2 algorithm was accepted by the community as a sub-algorithm of ECC. </span><span>After that, SM2 was gradually accepted by the kernel community.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>At present, libgcrypt has fully supported the national secret algorithm SM2/3/4, and these implementations will be officially released in the next version 1.9.0. </span><span>At the same time, as a user-mode tool for IMA integrity signatures, ima-evm-utils' support for national secrets has not fallen. </span><span>Click to view </span></span><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/ima-evm-utils/ci/ceecb28d3b5267c7d32c6e9401923c94f5786cfb/log/?path="><span><span>related submissions</span></span></a><span><span> .</span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Bloomberg) -- Carnival Fantasy was a ship famous for its outlandish dÃ©cor, all-night revelry and its sizeâ€”back when 2,000 was an incredible number of passengers. The â€œFun Shipâ€� vibe it introduced in 1990 came with such whimsical spaces as an Egyptian-themed piano bar, decorated with a fake sarcophagus, and a glitzy glass-topped atrium that was the hub of the social scene.</p><p>Today the Fantasy is attracting a whole different breed of booty-seeker. In July, the 30-year-old ship sailed to the Aegean Sea, wrapping its final voyageÂ&nbsp;in the shipbreaking capital of Aliaga, Turkey.</p><p>Its resting place there isÂ&nbsp;aÂ&nbsp;demolition yard where old cargo ships, tankers, research vesselsâ€”and now cruise ships retired during the Covid-19 pandemicâ€”get torn apart and broken into pieces. In this case, theyâ€™re not being broken in half to  get upgraded and stitched back together. Instead,Â&nbsp;circling the Fantasyâ€™s partially deconstructed innards are buyers from all sorts of industries, looking for rock bottom deals on everything from artwork and kitchenwares to electrical wires and stainless-steel sinks.</p><p>For the cruise company, itâ€™s an opportunity to recoup at least some value from an asset thatâ€™s currently acting as dead weight; while shipsâ€™ values  declineÂ&nbsp;with age, the Fantasy was originally built for about $225 million. And for the recycling companies that buy the vesselÂ&nbsp;for cash and take on the hazardous task of emptying all its valuables, itâ€™s a matter of a months-long salvage resale on steroids.</p><p>Cutting the Losses</p><p>Itâ€™s hard to gauge how exactly much money is made off of cruise ship recycling. Companies donâ€™t immediately disclose the sale prices of the vessels after relinquishing ownership, and the resale value of their most sought-after commodity, scrap steel, fluctuates in each global market on a daily basis.Â&nbsp;</p><p>But the business is booming.</p><p>Next to Carnival Fantasy in Aliaga are two otherÂ&nbsp;Fantasy-class ships built in the late 1990s. And next to them are two former Royal Caribbean vessels (scrapped by Royalâ€™s Spanish partner line Pullmantur Cruceros). The ships all had big fan bases, even as they aged. Fantasy and its sister ships started 2020 full of passengers bent on fun-in-the-sun activities in the Caribbean, Bahamas, and Mexican Riviera.</p><p>The ships would have left the fleet in coming years even in a healthy industry; the pandemic sped up the process, with owners of idled vesselsÂ&nbsp;hemorrhaging cashÂ&nbsp;and looking to cut their losses.</p><p>In its third quarter filing, Carnival Corporation said it planned to sell 18 â€œless efficientâ€� ships in 2020, resulting in a 12% reduction of its nine-brand fleet. â€œThose ships were giving us a bad drain,â€� Carnival CEO Arnold Donald said during a recent webinar with the Society of American Travel Writers.</p><p>Going, Going, Gone</p><p>Without much of a market for second-hand tonnage, the main worth of the ships is the steel that makes up the superstructure.</p><p>If, for instance, Carnival Fantasy has 15,000 tons of steel in its superstructure, the scrap may sell for upwards of $4.7 million based on current global market pricesâ€”though other factors also come into play, such as local prices and demand.</p><p>Along with the risk of these market fluctuations, the buyer also takes on the uncertainty of just how much metal can be salvaged. Pre-1990s ships tend to have more steel in their hulls and underwater plating, but those built in the â€™90s and after can bear lighter and stronger alloys.</p><p>Either way, steel and metal scraps will travel to a smelter to make rebar for construction projects around the world. Steel from some other dismantled ships can find its way to Turkeyâ€™s  large car manufacturing industry, where it might become parts for a Toyota orÂ&nbsp;a Ford.</p><p>Aluminum, copper, and stainless steel are also salvaged and resold, along with other valuable commodities that mostly remain in Turkey. The ripped out teak decks on Fantasy may end up in local shops, restaurants, and homes. Theater scenery and lighting may find its way into show productions. Even the tackiest artwork has some value, and can end up in restaurants throughout the country.</p><p>Buyers come to the yard for everything down to the bolts and nuts. Even if a used toilet sells for a fraction of the shelf price, multiply that amount by a few thousandâ€”given the number of cabins and public spaces on each shipâ€”and it can add up to a substantial sum.</p><p>According to Orbay Simsek, vice president of the Aliaga-based Simsekler Ship Recycling Company, there are even markets for kitchenware, closets, and blankets.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Basically anything and everything that can be sold, sells. Everything must go. Even the sarcophagus.</p><p>Eco-friendly Shipbreaking</p><p>Taking apart ships is a controversial topic, thanks to concerns over both human and environmental risks. Itâ€™s one of the most dangerous jobs in the world, according to Wouter Rozenveld, director of Sea2Cradle (SC2), an expert in green ship recycling who was hired by Carnival to oversee the safe dismantling of its ships. Each Carnival vessel may take up to nine months to break down, he says, and the blowtorch-based work comes with constant fire hazards.</p><p>Those hazards are amplified when the recyclable component pieces, like furniture, cabling, piping, and machinery inside each deck have to be carefully taken apart and separated says Ehud Bar-Lev, who overseesÂ&nbsp;assessment services at maritime specialist Lloydâ€™s Register.</p><p>The extra steps in disassembly also increase potential for hazardous waste spills, containing everything from oily residues to sludge, asbestos, and coolants in fridges.</p><p>To prevent those incidents, the Turkish shipbreaking yard undertakes its work in a concrete holding area that catches debris; in similar facilities throughout India and Bangladesh, the process may happen on the beach. Rather thanÂ&nbsp;letting toxic chemicals spew into the water, the Turkish yard collects the materials, has them cataloged by Sea2Cradle, and then hands them over toÂ&nbsp;the government-runÂ&nbsp;Ship Recycling Association of Turkey for proper disposal.</p><p>Carnival Corporation saw these precautions as a marketingÂ&nbsp;opportunity, making aÂ&nbsp;highly unusual move to publicize its efforts as â€œresponsible recycling.â€� But it was the shipbreaking yard, not Carnival, that saw the biggest windfall as a result:Â&nbsp;never before hasÂ&nbsp;AliagaÂ&nbsp;seen five mega cruise ships in its harbor.</p><p>There may be more coming in the months ahead.</p><p>â€œThe longer the pandemic rages on in the world, the more cruise ships will end up in scrapyards, and my guess is at an increasingly younger age,â€� says ManWo Ng, a maritime management professor at Virginiaâ€™s Old Dominion University. â€œEven if a vaccine becomes available, how many of us will be comfortable jumping right back on cruise ships?â€�</p><p>Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>]]>

October 29, 2020 | https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of unattributed wisdom that's stuck with me is "don't take more than one technology bet". At Ladder, our big bet is using <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2>Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2>Developer experience</h2>
<p>When I’ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>It’s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespace’s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2>Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

                <h2>The Syllabaries</h2>
                <div><p>
                  The Japanese language, called 日本語（にほんご）[knee-hohn-go] is composed of 2 major syllabaries, <strong>Hiragana and Katakana.</strong> Made up of <strong>Consonant-Vowel pairs</strong> [ka, ga, ta, su, mu] as opposed to single letters that can be combined in variety, Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same collection, Katakana being used for <strong>foreign loan words</strong> since the reorganization of public education in 1962.</p><p>
                  In addition to Hiragana (the native script) and Katakana (reserved for foreign loan-words post-62), Japan imported symbolic glyphs from mainland Asia and they are referred to as 漢字（かんじ） kanji — letters of the Han Dynasty.
              </p></div>
                <p>
                  You can learn the Hiragana in the inside front cover of our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">guide</a> that contains information on essential grammar, sentence structure, sound-effect language, and covers some of the more nuanced aspects of the language in plain English.</p>

            <h4>Hiragana ひらがな</h4>
            <p>Warm and curvy, the ひらがな [hiragana] are used for native Japanese words and are the primary phonetic syllabary of Japanese.
            </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Katakana カタカナ</h4>
          <p>
            The カタカナ [katakana] are sharp and angular, and while letters to friends have been written entirely in Katakana (and Kanji), <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Masabumi_Hosono_titanic_diary.jpg">such as this beautiful letter recovered from the Titanic,</a> since 1962 the カタカナ [katakana] have been reserved for foreign loan-words such as "computer" コンピュータ [konpyuuta] and "glass" ガラス [garasu].  <br>カタカナ [katakana] have a one-to-one correlation with the ひらがな [hiragana] similar to how English has print and cursive.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Kanji 漢字（かんじ）</h4>
          <p>
           The 漢字（かんじ） [kanji] were imported lock, stock, and barrel from mainland Asia starting in the 5th century.  Fewer than 4% of them are pictographs, and over 90% of the kanji are "meaning and sound borrowers."  You can read more about the <a href="https://learnjapanesebest.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/the-four-types-of-kanji/">four types of kanji here.</a>

                <p>
                  「聞き取れない」（ききとれない）[kiki-torenai] is the Japanese expression for "unable to get a clear ear grab" of a sound or a term when listening.  The audible morphemes of Japanese require plenty of exposure to be able to distinguish them easily, due in part to the clunkiness of the syllabaries, the ひらがな Hiragana and カタカナ Katakana.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Japanese Complete provides a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/path/japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">ひらがな Hiragana listening challenge</a> for free to all; our カタカナ Katakana listening challenge is available to <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/purchase">premium subscribers</a>
              </p>
                <p>
                  The site <a href="https://supernative.tv/">SuperNative.tv</a> has an incredible cornucopia of film and television show clips that one can watch on replay with subtitles and fill-in-the-blank exercises to practice the ability to "ear catch" or "ear grab" the audible morphemes of Japanese.  We highly recommend this resource for new learners to get an "ear grip" of the common Japanese sounds and how they are actually pronounced.  Naturally, real-life speech and the way it is written down may not appear to match up perfectly until one has plenty of exposure.</p>

                <h2>Grammar: Particles</h2>
                <p>
                  Rather than relying on word sequence, Japanese relies on particles to partner with words in order to indicate the role of the word in the sentence.  Think of particles as dancing partners wearing brightly colored clothing who let you know the current occupation of their partner.  A subject dances with a pink-scarf wearing dancer.  A topic dances with a blue-scarf wearing dancer.  A destination of travel dances with a green-scarf wearing dancer.  When we look at the dancers, we can see clearly who they are dancing with, letting us know what the sentence means.  
              </p>
              <p>Particles are used to explain the <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong> of Japanese sentences and they are in <strong>post-fix position</strong>, meaning that they follow the words to which they snap.</p>
              <p>Mastery of particles is essential to having a native-level understanding of Japanese.  In fact, by exploring a frequency dictionary or the <a href="https://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/bccwj/en/">Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese,</a> one will find that <em>of the 37 most frequent words, 17 of them are particles (45%).</em></p>
                <p>
                  In Japanese Complete we teach particles using a method devised specifically for Japanese Complete and not available elsewhere: <strong>the bunsetsu jar</strong>.  Every jar (which contains a person, place, or thing) needs a lid (which contains a grammatical particle).</p>

              <p>In acquiring Japanese, modern learners often rely on methods inspired by <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921?pldnSite=1">Heisig's Remembering the Kanji,</a> a book written by James Heisig after he had arrived in Japan too late to take the introductory course; upon asking his friends what the hardest part of the language was, he was quickly informed that the Kanji are a most formidable adversary.  He took the spare time before the next semester started to try his best to conquer this formidable opponent, and in the process discovered that he could break the kanji down section-by-section, part-by-part, and develop clever mnemonic devices and imaginary scenes to remember their <strong>general meanings</strong> for the long-term.
              </p>
                <p>
                  Heisig only provides clear and concise mnemonics for the first hundred-or-so kanji in his series, which is quite deflating to the beginner, leaving much of the creative and mental work to the learner when they could be absorbing, rather than generating, content.  This is the reason that we have taken it upon ourselves at Japanese Complete to provide detailed mnemonic lessons for the kanji we teach.

                <h2>Verbs: Meanings, Connotations</h2>
                <p>
                  Every Japanese sentence ends with a verb.  Our classification scheme in Japanese Complete comes from conversations with expert language teachers from University College London and Middlebury College, schools renowned for their East Asian studies and language departments.  While normal textbooks try to wedge Japanese grammar as a round peg into the square-hole shape of English, Japanese Complete strives to simplify the equation as much as possible while retaining all the fidelity and integrity of real Japanese.  Our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">Reverse Engineering a Japanese Sentence</a> page details how our classification of verbs and nouns differs from common textbooks, and illustrates how they are more coherent with actual Japanese.
              </p>
              <p>In general, verbs are the missing piece of every Japanese sentence and we must wait until the end of the sentence or phrase to hear or read them.  This is what makes translation and interpretation notoriously difficult, for a translator needing a verb to connect two thoughts, nouns, or ideas, must allow the Japanese speaker to complete the phrase, adding a significant delay to the process, all-the-while needing to be able to perceive the beginning of the next phrase.  The latency effect in translating and interpreting Japanese makes this skill quite coveted in tourism, national and international diplomacy, and any role where interpretation in real-time is a must.
              </p>
                <p>
                By learning a large subset of verbs in their "plain-form" first, and then learning how to transform verbs into their variety of tenses and aspects, one builds a solid foundation for understanding written and oral Japanese.  <strong>It is wise to familiarize oneself with the great variety of tenses, active and passive constructions, and formality levels early on, so that they are not completely foreign when encountered later on in advanced studies.</strong>  In Japanese Complete, we teach politeness levels, active and passive tenses, and the variety of verbs early on so that learners have a solid foundation and are not surprised to find whole new constructions in years 3 or 4, but instead are immediately confronted with the variegated tones of the language and its inflexions.

<p>If Democrats win both the White House and the Senate (and maintain control of the House) you’ll see revived efforts to pick up the pieces of the Affordable Care Act and continue to transform the U.S. healthcare system. This transformation is likely to come at the expense of private healthcare companies' bottom lines.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Republicans maintaining control of the White House and/or Senate would likely result in a divided government, with no significant legislation on healthcare being passed.</p>

<p><span><strong>Cannabis</strong></span></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, most major cannabis stocks have a very low Trump Beta, meaning they are likely to perform well if Biden is elected.</p>

<p>Though Biden took a tough stance on federally controlled substances back in the 1980s and 1990s, he has recently embraced a platform of decriminalizing marijuana. Additionally, running mate Kamala Harris is known as an advocate for legalization. As a junior senator in California, she sponsored the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which the Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee passed last November. The bill hasn’t gotten anywhere yet, but many suppose that a democratic sweep this November could lead to marijuana legalization.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cannabis legislation has not been a priority under Trump, and there is no reason right now to believe that this will change during a second term.</p>

<p><span><strong>Large-cap Tech Companies</strong></span></p>
<p>Companies in the technology services and electronic technology sectors have an average Trump Beta of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. This is primarily driven by the large-cap tech companies that dominate their industries, with Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Adobe all showing strong positive correlations with a Trump re-election.</p></div></div></td></tr></tbody></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>Web Audio API</h2>
<p>I’ve been working on getting WebRTC video chat working here on the website for a few weeks now. I finally got to the point where both text, video chat, and screen sharing all work really well, but somewhere in the back of my mind I kept thinking about complaints about “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-waves/202007/why-zoom-fatigue-is-real-and-what-you-can-do-about-it">Zoom fatigue</a>” during the pandemic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zoom fatigue, Hall argues now, is real. “Zoom is exhausting and lonely because you have to be so much more attentive and so much more aware of what’s going on than you do on phone calls.” If you haven’t turned off your own camera, you are also watching yourself speak, which can be arousing and disconcerting. The blips, delays and cut off sentences also create confusion. Much more exploration needs to be done, but he says, “maybe this isn’t the solution to our problems that we thought it might have been.” Phone calls, by comparison, are less demanding. “You can be in your own space. You can take a walk, make dinner,” Hall says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s kind of an interesting thing to have on your mind while spending weeks writing/debugging/testing video chat code.</p>
<p>So I decided to add an audio-only mode. And if I was gonna do that, I had to show something cool in place of the video. So I figured I would try to add audio visualizations when one or both of the users didn’t have video on. Using the relatively recent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> seemed like the right way to go.</p>
<p>Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<div><video controls="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline="" loop=""><source src="https://media.dwayne.xyz/blog/audio-visualization.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>Screen recording of the local audio visualization. I cycle through bar graph in light mode, bar graph in dark mode, sine wave in dark mode, then sine wave in light mode.</p></div>
<h2>Creating and hooking up an AnalyserNode</h2>
<p>To create audio visualizations, the first thing you’ll need is an <code>AnalyserNode</code>, which you can get from the <code>createAnalyser</code> method of a <code>BaseAudioContext</code>. You can get both of these things pretty easily<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> audioContext <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>window</span>.AudioContext();
<span>2</span><span>const</span> analyser <span>=</span> audioContext.createAnalyser();
</pre><p>Next, create a <code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code> from an existing data stream (I use either the local or remote data streams from either <code>getUserMedia</code> or from the ‘track’ event of <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> respectively) using <code>AudioContext.createMediaStreamSource</code>. Then you can connect that audio source to the analyser object like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> audioSource <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
<span>2</span>audioSource.connect(analyser);
</pre>
<h2>Using requestAnimationFrame</h2>
<p><code>window.requestAnimationFrame</code> is nice. Call it, passing in your drawing function, and then inside that function call <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> again. Get yourself a nice little recursive loop going that’s automatically timed properly by the browser.</p>
<p>In my situation, there will either be 0, 1, or 2 visualizations running, since either side can choose either video chat, audio-only (…except during screen sharing), or just text chat. So I have one loop that draws both. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> drawAudioVisualizations <span>=</span> () =&gt; {
<span>2</span>    audioCancel <span>=</span> <span>window</span>.requestAnimationFrame(drawAudioVisualizations);
<span>3</span>    localAudioVisualization.draw();
<span>4</span>    remoteAudioVisualization.draw();
<span>5</span>};
</pre><p>I created the class for those visualization objects, and they handle whether or not to draw. They each contain the analyser, source, and context objects for their visualization.</p>
<p>Then when I detect that loop doesn’t have to run anymore, I can cancel it using that <code>audioCancel</code> value:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>window</span>.cancelAnimationFrame(audioCancel);
<span>2</span>audioCancel <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
</pre>
<h2>Configuring the Analyser</h2>
<p>Like in the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/voice-change-o-matic/blob/gh-pages/scripts/app.js">example you’ll see a lot</a> if you look at the MDN documentation for this stuff, I provide options for two audio visualizations: frequency bars and a sine wave. Here’s how I configure the analyser for each type:</p>
<pre><span> 1</span><span>switch</span> (<span>this</span>.type) {
<span> 2</span>    <span>case</span> <span>'frequencybars'</span><span>:</span>
<span> 3</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.minDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>90</span>;
<span> 4</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.maxDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span>;
<span> 5</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.smoothingTimeConstant <span>=</span> <span>0.85</span>;
<span> 6</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize <span>=</span> <span>256</span>;
<span> 7</span>        <span>this</span>.bufferLength <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.analyser.frequencyBinCount;
<span> 8</span>        <span>this</span>.dataArray <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Uint8Array(<span>this</span>.bufferLength);
<span> 9</span>        <span>break</span>;
<span>10</span>    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
<span>11</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.minDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>90</span>;
<span>12</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.maxDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span>;
<span>13</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.smoothingTimeConstant <span>=</span> <span>0.9</span>;
<span>14</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>;
<span>15</span>        <span>this</span>.bufferLength <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize;
<span>16</span>        <span>this</span>.dataArray <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Uint8Array(<span>this</span>.bufferLength);
<span>17</span>        <span>break</span>;
<span>18</span>}
</pre><div><p>I’ve adjusted these numbers a lot, and I’m gonna keep doing it. A note about <code>fftSize</code> and <code>frequencyBinCount</code>: <code>frequencyBinCount</code> is set right after you set <code>fftSize</code> and it’s usually just half the <code>fftSize</code> value. These values are about the amount of data you want to receive from the main analyser functions I’m about to talk about next. As you can see, they directly control the size of the data array that you’ll use to store the audio data on each draw call.
</p></div>
<h2>Using the Analyser</h2>
<p>On each draw call, depending on the type of visualization, call either <code>getByteFrequencyData</code> or <code>getByteTimeDomainData</code> with the array that was created above, and it’ll be filled with data. Then you run a simple loop over each element and start drawing. Here’s my sine wave code:</p>
<pre><span> 1</span><span>this</span>.analyser.getByteTimeDomainData(<span>this</span>.dataArray);
<span> 2</span><span>this</span>.ctx.lineWidth <span>=</span> <span>2</span>;
<span> 3</span><span>this</span>.ctx.strokeStyle <span>=</span> audioSecondaryStroke;
<span> 4</span>
<span> 5</span><span>this</span>.ctx.beginPath();
<span> 6</span>
<span> 7</span><span>let</span> v, y;
<span> 8</span><span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>this</span>.bufferLength; i<span>++</span>) {
<span> 9</span>    v <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.dataArray[i] <span>/</span> <span>128.0</span>;
<span>10</span>    y <span>=</span> v <span>*</span> height <span>/</span> <span>2</span>;
<span>11</span>
<span>12</span>    <span>if</span> (i <span>===</span> <span>0</span>) {
<span>13</span>        <span>this</span>.ctx.moveTo(x, y);
<span>14</span>    } <span>else</span> {
<span>15</span>        <span>this</span>.ctx.lineTo(x, y);
<span>16</span>    }
<span>17</span>
<span>18</span>    x <span>+=</span> width <span>*</span> <span>1.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>this</span>.bufferLength;
<span>19</span>}
<span>20</span>
<span>21</span><span>this</span>.ctx.lineTo(width, height <span>/</span> <span>2</span>);
<span>22</span><span>this</span>.ctx.stroke();
</pre><div><p>The fill and stroke colors are dynamic based on the website color scheme.
</p></div>
<h2>Good ol' Safari</h2>
<p>So I did all of this stuff I just talked about, but for <strong>days</strong> I could <em>not</em> get this to work in Safari. Not because of errors or anything, but because both <code>getByteFrequencyData</code> and <code>getByteTimeDomainData</code> just filled the array with 0s every time. No matter what I did. I was able to get the audio data in Firefox just fine.</p>
<p>So at first, I figured it just didn’t work at all in Safari and I would just have to wait until Apple fixed it. But then I came across <a href="https://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/">this sample audio project</a> and noticed it worked just fine in Safari.</p>
<div><p>So I studied the code for an hour trying to understand what was different about my code and theirs. I made a lot of changes to my code to make it more like what they were doing. One of the big differences is that they’re connecting the audio source to different audio distortion nodes to actually change the audio. I just want to create a visualization so I wasn’t using any of those objects.
</p></div>
<h3>Audio Distortion Effects</h3>
<p>The <code>BaseAudioContext</code> has a few methods you can use to create audio distortion objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WaveShaperNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createWaveShaper</code> to create a non-linear distortion. You can use a custom function to change the audio data.</li>
<li><code>GainNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createGain</code> to control the overall gain (volume) of the audio.</li>
<li><code>BiquadFilterNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createBiquadFilter</code> to apply some common audio effects.</li>
<li><code>ConvolverNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createConvolver</code> to apply reverb effects to audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one of these objects has a <code>connect</code> function where you pass another context, output, or filter. Each one has a certain number of inputs and outputs. Here’s an example from that sample project of connecting all of them:</p>
<pre><span>1</span>source <span>=</span> audioCtx.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
<span>2</span>source.connect(distortion);
<span>3</span>distortion.connect(biquadFilter);
<span>4</span>biquadFilter.connect(gainNode);
<span>5</span>convolver.connect(gainNode);
<span>6</span>gainNode.connect(analyser);
<span>7</span>analyser.connect(audioCtx.destination);
</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t connect to your audio context <code>destination</code> if you’re just trying to create a visualization for a call. The user will hear themselves talking.</p>
<div><p>Anyway, I tried adding these things to my code to see if that would get it working in Safari, but I had no luck.
</p></div>
<h2>Figuring out the Safari issue</h2>
<p>I was starting to get <em>real</em> frustrated trying to figure this out. I was gonna let it go when I thought Safari was just broken (because it usually is), but since I knew it <em>could</em> work in Safari, I couldn’t leave it alone.</p>
<p>Eventually I downloaded the actual HTML and Javascript files from that sample and started removing shit from their code, running it locally and seeing if it worked. Which it did. So now I’m editing my own code, and <em>their code</em>, to get them to be pretty much the same. Which I did. And <strong>still</strong> theirs worked and mine didn’t.</p>
<p>Next I just started desperately logging every single object at different points in my code to figure out what the fuck was going on. Then I noticed something.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://media.dwayne.xyz/blog/audio-context-suspended.png" alt="Dev console showing the output of logging this.audioContext. The state attribute is shown as suspended"></p><p>Output of logging the audio context object.</p></div>
<p>The <code>state</code> is “suspended”? Why? I don’t know. I did the same log in the sample code (that I had downloaded and was running on my machine) and it was “running”.</p>
<p>This is the code that fixes it:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>this</span>.audioSource <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(<span>this</span>.stream);
<span>2</span><span>this</span>.audioSource.connect(<span>this</span>.analyser);
<span>3</span><span>this</span>.audioContext.resume(); <span>// Why??????
</span></pre><div><p>Calling <code>resume</code> changes the state and then everything works. To this day I still don’t know why the sample code didn’t need that line.
</p></div>
<h2>Drawing the image and supporting light/dark modes</h2>
<p>Like everything else on my site, all of this must support different color schemes (and screen sizes, and mobile devices). That was surprisingly difficult when trying to draw an SVG on the canvas.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a> for all my icons on the site. I wanted to use one of them for these visualizations. The FontAwesome files are all SVGs (which is great), but I didn’t know how to draw the image in different colors in Javascript. The way I decided to do this was to load the SVG file into a Javascript <code>Image</code> object, then draw that onto the canvas each draw call.</p>
<p>That worked, but it only drew it black even after changing the fill and stroke colors. So after some web searching I read about someone deciding to draw out an image on an offscreen canvas, reading all the image data, and …</p></div></div>

    <p>
  <strong>Vega-Lite</strong> is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.
</p>

<p><span>
  <span>
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to <strong>properties of graphical marks</strong> (e.g., points or bars).
    The Vega-Lite compiler <strong>automatically produces visualization components</strong> including axes, legends, and scales.
    It determines default properties of these components based on a set of <strong>carefully designed rules</strong>.
    This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization.
    As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both <strong>data transformations</strong> (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and <strong>visual transformations</strong> (e.g., stacking and faceting).
    Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be <strong>composed</strong> into layered and multi-view displays, and made <strong>interactive with selections</strong>.

  </span>
</span></p>

<p>Compared to <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega">Vega</a>, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the <em>primary</em> visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.</p>

<div><h2 id="The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">The Virtues of Prototyping<a href="#The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">¶</a></h2><p>One neat thing about prototyping (with Python or whatever) is that it allows you to fully focus on your <em>approach</em>, rather than on the infrastructure. Very obviously, this is useful for <em>teaching</em> – you can use examples as the ones above in a lecture to very quickly communicate essential techniques of program analysis and test generation.</p>
<p>But prototyping has more advantages. A Jupyter Notebook (like this one) documents how you developed your approach, together with examples, experiments, and rationales – and still focusing on the essentials. If you write a tool the "classical" way, you will eventually deliver thousands of lines of code that do everything under the sun, but only once you have implemented everything will you know whether things actually work. This is a huge risk, and if you still have to change things, you will have to refactor things again and again. Furthermore, for anyone who will work on that code later, it will take days, if not weeks, to re-extract the basic idea of the approach, as it will be buried under loads and loads of infrastructure and refactorings.</p>
<p>Our consequence at this point is that we now implement new ideas <em>twice</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, we implement things as a notebook (as this one), experimenting with various approaches and parameters until we get them right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only once we have the approach right, and if we have confidence that it works, we reimplement it in a tool that works on large scale programs. This can still take weeks to months, but at least we know we are on a good path.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, it may well be that the original notebooks will have a longer life, as they are simpler, better documented, and capture the gist of our novel idea. And this is how several of the notebooks in this book came to be.</p>

<p>Zoom recently announced that they were going to make end-to-end encryption available to all of their users–not just customers.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>This is a good move, especially for people living in countries with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/02/how-and-why-america-was-hit-so-hard-by-covid-19/">inept leadership that failed to address the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and therefore need to conduct their work and schooling remotely through software like Zoom. I enthusiastically applaud them for making this change.</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The end-to-end encryption capability arrives on the heels of their acquisition of <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> in earlier this year. Hiring a team of security experts and cryptography engineers seems like a good move overall.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this news, I decided to be a good neighbor and take a look at their source code, with the reasoning, “If so many people’s privacy is going to be dependent on Zoom’s security, I might as well make sure they’re not doing something ridiculously bad.”</p>



<p>Except I couldn’t find their source code anywhere online. But they did publish <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper">a white paper on Github</a>…</p>







<h2>Disclaimers</h2>



<p>What follows is the opinion of some guy on the Internet with a fursona–so whether or not you choose to take it seriously should be informed by this context. It is not the opinion of anyone’s employer, nor is it endorsed by Zoom, etc. Tell your lawyers to calm their nips.</p>



<p>More importantly, I’m not here to hate on Zoom for doing a good thing, nor on the security experts that worked hard on making Zoom better for their users. The responsibility of security professionals is to the users, after all.</p>



<p>Also, these aren’t zero-days, so don’t try to lecture me about “responsible” disclosure. (That term is also <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">problematic</a>, by the way.)</p>



<p>Got it? Good. Let’s move on.</p>







<h2>Bizarre Design Choices in Version 2.3 of Zoom’s E2E White Paper</h2>



<p>Note: I’ve altered the screenshots to be white text on a black background, since my blog’s color scheme is darker than a typical academic PDF. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/d3be2a5a3e16be04f1199b92630f180ba79cb51c/zoom_e2e.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1744" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-02/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png" data-orig-size="784,652" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>It’s a little weird that they’re calculating a signature over SHA256(Context) || SHA256(M), considering Ed25519 uses SHA512 internally.</p>



<p>It would make just as much sense to sign Context || M directly–or, if pre-hashing large streams is needed, SHA512(Context || M).</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1740" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-01/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png" data-orig-size="1039,788" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>At the top of this section, it says it uses libsodium’s <code>crypto_box</code> interface. But then they go onto… not actually use it.</p>



<p>Instead, they wrote their own protocol using HKDF, two SHA256 hashes, and XChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>While secure, this isn’t <em>really</em> using the crypto_box interface.</p>



<p>The only part of the libsodium interface that’s being used is <code><a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/927dfe8e2eaa86160d3ba12a7e3258fbc322909c/src/libsodium/crypto_box/curve25519xsalsa20poly1305/box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305.c#L35-L46">crypto_box_beforenm()</a></code>, which could easily have been a call to <code>crypto_scalarmult()</code>instead (since they’re passing the output of the scalar multiplication to HKDF anyway).</p>







<p>Also, the SHA256(a) || SHA256(b) pattern returns. Zoom’s engineers must love SHA256 for some reason.</p>



<p>This time, it’s in the additional associated data for the XChaCha20-Poly1305. </p>



<p>Binding the ciphertext and the signature to the same context string is a sensible thing to do, it’s just the concatenation of SHA256 hashes is a bit weird when SHA512 exists.</p>



<h3>Meeting Leader Security Code</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1746" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-03/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" data-orig-size="760,733" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Here we see Zoom using the a SHA256 of a constant string (“<code>Zoombase-1-ClientOnly-MAC-SecurityCode</code>“) in a construction that tries but fails to be HMAC.</p>



<p>And then they concatenate it with the SHA256 hash of the public key (which is already a 256-bit value), and then they hash the whole thing again.</p>



<p>It’s redundant SHA256 all the way down. The redundancy of “MAC” and “SecurityCode” in their constant string is, at least, consistent with the rest of their design philosophy.</p>



<p>It would be a real shame if double-hashing carried the risk of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/382">invalidating security proofs</a>, or if <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/kmd5.pdf">the security proof for HMAC</a> required a high Hamming distance of padding constants and this design decision also later <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/684.pdf">saved HMAC from related-key attacks</a>.</p>



<h3>Hiding Personal Details</h3>

<p>Wait, you’re telling me Zoom was aware of HMAC’s existence this whole time?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1202" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-02/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>I give up!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Enough Pointless Dunking, What’s the Takeaway?</h2>



<p>None of the design decisions Zoom made that I’ve criticized here are security vulnerabilities, but they do demonstrate an early lack of cryptography expertise in their product design.</p>



<p>After all, the weirdness is almost entirely contained in section 3 of their white paper, which describes the “Phase I” of their rollout. So what I’ve pointed out here appears to be mostly legacy cruft that wasn’t risky enough to bother changing in their final design.</p>



<p>The rest of their paper is pretty straightforward and pleasant to read. Their design makes sense in general, and each phase includes an “Areas to Improve” section.</p>



<p>All in all, if you’re worried about the security of Zoom’s E2EE feature, the only thing they can really do better is to publish the source code (and link to it from the whitepaper repository for ease-of-discovery) for this feature so independent experts can publicly review it.</p>



<p>However, they seem to be getting a lot of mileage out of the experts on their payroll, so I wouldn’t count on that happening.</p>

I'm a subscription-based SaaS company running expensive cloud infrastructure (on Kubernetes) that is shared across all of my customers.</p><p>Today, I can approximate my total margin using monthly revenue from Stripe and my infrastructure bill from AWS. However, I have no insights into how each customer contributes to margin. Given <strong>margin per customer</strong>, I could answer several valuable questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Who are my good (high-margin) customers and who are my bad (low/negative-margin) customers?</strong></li><li><strong>How are my margins changing as my business grows?</strong></li><li><strong>How are changes to my products affecting my profits?</strong></li></ul><p>The solution here can be complicated. </p><p>Assuming that my cost is primarily cloud infrastructure costs, to getÂ&nbsp;<strong>cost per customer*</strong>, first I need to set up monitoring layers to properly measure customer usage. Then, I need to enrich the usage data with cloud prices. To complicate matters further, I need to consolidate and store this data long-term to maintain historical views of my business across my distributed infrastructure. Finally, I need to join this data withÂ&nbsp;<strong>revenue per customer**</strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, my customers are segmented by jobs (i.e., pods, namespaces, and(or) clusters). In this case,Â&nbsp;<strong>cost per customer </strong>is approximately the cost of a customer's namespace. I can track cost per namespace using the <strong><span><a href="https://getoctane.io/">Octane</a></span></strong> Cost API and join myÂ&nbsp;<strong>revenue per customer</strong>Â&nbsp;using the <strong><span><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></span></strong> API. Through these integrations, I can extract real-timeÂ&nbsp;<strong>margin per customer</strong>.</p><p><span>[Important to note that we understand that many SaaS companies will not have customers segmented by namespaces. For purposes of blog post we have chosen to simplify the problem]</span></p><p>Here are main components and steps to complete:</p><p><strong>cost per customer</strong>:</p><ol><li>(pre-requisite) set upÂ&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://getoctane.io/">Octane</a></span></strong>Â&nbsp;and connect cluster(s) to measure infrastructure costs</li><li>set up Octane accounts to track namespaces (I've chosen to segment customers by namespace for this example)</li><li>fetch costs for the customer accounts</li></ol><p><strong>revenue per customer</strong>:</p><ol><li>(pre-requisite) set upÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></span>Â&nbsp;to track customer subscriptions</li><li>fetch Stripe subscriptions and compute the expected charge for a given time range</li></ol><p><strong>margin per customer:</strong>Â&nbsp;</p><ol><li>formula: (<strong>revenue per customer</strong>Â&nbsp;-Â&nbsp;<strong>cost per customer</strong>) /Â&nbsp;<strong>revenue per customer</strong></li></ol><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>I did some pre-requisite steps to get the data I needed to get real-time cost per customer (Octane) and revenue per customer (Stripe).</p><p><strong>Set upÂ&nbsp;</strong><strong><span><a href="https://getoctane.io/">Octane</a></span></strong></p><ul><li>Register / Login</li><li>Add Kubernetes cluster</li></ul><p><strong> Set upÂ&nbsp;</strong><strong><span><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></span></strong></p><ul><li>Register / Login</li><li>Create customers</li><li>Add subscriptions for customers</li></ul><h3>Cost per customer</h3><p>Now, that our tools are setup, I need to start leveraging them to get real-time margin.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As discussed <a href="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/introducing-pants-v2/">in our post announcing Pants v2</a>, it's clear that Python has "grown up" by gaining facilities to help it to scale to larger projects. But as codebases grow and tool counts increase, more Python codebases need build tools. While you could write bespoke scripts to coordinate each of your tools, using Pants brings benefits like caching, concurrency, introspection, a simple and uniform user experience, and more!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, scalable build tools have historically meant a significant boilerplate burden: scattering <code>BUILD</code> files throughout your repository and then needing to edit both your code and the redundant dependency information in build definitions.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way! Pants v2 supports the precise caching, concurrency, and introspection that you need to scale your repository, with up to <strong>90%</strong> less <code>BUILD</code> boilerplate, thanks to… Dependency inference!</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="scalingup">Scaling up</h2>
<p>Pants supports repos of all sizes with minimal boilerplate, but it is particularly helpful in repositories containing multiple deployable or publishable projects, each with potentially different requirements or interpreters: aka, monorepos.</p>
<p>Monorepos have lots of benefits (no dependency conflicts, atomic cross-project commits, easy top-to-bottom continuous integration, linear change history), but essential to making them scale are the abilities to:</p>
<ol>
<li>test, check, and deploy precisely the portion of the repository that is relevant to you</li>
<li>cache builds and tests to avoid re-building when unrelated code has changed</li>
<li>manage and configure the variety of tooling that users of the repository will want to use</li>
</ol>
<p>It's critical in a monorepo to be able to test, check, and deploy exactly the relevant portion of your code, ideally with zero impact from changes in unrelated parts of the codebase. For example: if you have three libraries <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>, which depend on one another in a chain like <code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C</code>, a monorepo that builds from source using Pants allows you to completely ignore versioning (and <code>setup.py</code> files, per-project <code>requirements.txt</code>, etc) while you edit library <code>C</code>, even if you are running the tests for library <code>A</code>. If you have ten other projects (or one thousand!) in your repository and only a few of them depend on <code>C</code>, you'd like to avoid ever running tests or mypy for the unrelated libraries while editing <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>And in those cases when you <em>do</em> want to take advantage of a monorepo's top-to-bottom integration testing by running "all of your dependent's tests" (or maybe just typecheck them with Mypy!), you'd like to do that as quickly as possible by taking advantage of caching, concurrency, or transparently executing them on a cluster of machines using remote execution.</p>
<p>To enable this scalability, monorepo build tools like Pants v1 and Bazel required that the dependencies between libraries and files were declared in <code>BUILD</code> files. These dependencies were then used to determine which portions of the repository needed to be built, and which files needed to be included in cache keys.</p>
<p>"But wait", you say! "Doesn't that mean we've traded editing <code>setup.py</code> and <code>requirements.txt</code> files for every library for editing <code>BUILD</code> files for every library?" In most tools, that would be the case: but not in Pants v2! Pants v2 is different.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="dependencyinference">Dependency inference</h2>
<p>Pants 2.0.0 almost entirely eliminates the boilerplate of declaring dependencies between libraries thanks to "Dependency inference". Dependency inference is roughly what it sounds like: Pants supports discovering the dependencies between Python libraries by parsing <code>import</code> statements (and you can <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">use our powerful plugin API</a> to infer other dependencies, such as by parsing a Django settings file, YAML config, etc).</p>
<p>Rather than adding an <code>import</code> statement to your code resulting in your tests failing because you forgot to <em>also</em> update a <code>BUILD</code> file, Pants will use your newly added <code>import</code> statement to infer that that file now has a dependency within the repository (or outside it via your <code>requirements.txt</code>). When designing inference, we strove to remove boilerplate without introducing magic, so <code>BUILD</code> files are still used to declare any metadata your library might have (the version of the Python interpreter to use, etc), and can be used to <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/targets#dependencies-and-dependency-inference">override or extend</a> the inferred dependencies.</p>
<p>Even better, Pants infers these dependencies <em>at the file level</em>. Rather than adding a dependency from "the library named <code>A</code>" to "the library named <code>B</code>" (or "target" in monorepo parlance), Pants tracks that "file <code>a.py</code> depends on file "<code>b.py</code>". Rather than staring at the content of your <code>BUILD</code> files to (attempt to?) understand your dependencies, you can use Pants' dependency introspection tools to easily explore them at the file level: <code>./pants dependencies $file</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, we’ve found that inferred file-level dependencies can reduce the total per-file dependency count by an average of <strong>30%</strong> (improving cache hit rates), and reduce the size of <code>BUILD</code> files by up to <strong>90%</strong> (reducing boilerplate)! See our docs for <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/how-does-pants-work#dependency-inference">a real world example</a>.</p>
<p>And critically (as we’ll discuss in further posts!), dependency inference is both 1) very safe, and 2) very fast. Because Pants invokes processes hermetically using SHA256 fingerprinting and strong sandboxes (your test frameworks, your linters, mypy, everything), failing to infer a dependency can never cause the wrong things to be cached. And because the core of Pants is implemented in Rust — and uses a daemon, parallelism, and very-fine-grained memoization — inference won’t slow you down!</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>To show what it’s like to use dependency inference, we’ll quickly add a feature with assistance from some new first and third party dependencies (from sources and PyPI, respectively).</p>
<p>We’ll start with a broken test that expects TOML files to be supported by a library in a different directory:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/1.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Because we’re curious, we’ll start by asking Pants whether the library already (directly) depends on TOML:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/2.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Nope. Only YAML. But let’s add the <code>import</code> statement and see what happens…</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/3.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Voila! This file now declares a dependency on TOML via the <code>import</code> statement, without any modifications to <code>BUILD</code> files. But we’re not finished: neither the flake8 linter nor the customer will be satisfied with an unused <code>import</code>! Let’s finish adding the feature, and then re-run the test.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/4.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Ok, TOML is clearly being used: but this time our test needs tweaking. To fix it we can import a <code>TomlSerializer</code> helper class from a second library (another new dependency!). We already know that we don’t need to check the <code>BUILD</code> file to see whether this test declares a dependency on the library, so we can just focus on our code!:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/5.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Great: our test is now passing! To fix it, we edited two files and introduced two new dependencies -- but we didn’t need to edit any <code>BUILD</code> files, despite these files living in different targets!</p>
<p>Finally, let’s confirm the critical monorepo scalability property that edits to unrelated files don’t invalidate the caching of our new test. Although this test is quick, there are a few hundred files in this repository, and plenty of other tests that could take long enough to result in coffee breaks!:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/6.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Excellent! Thanks to dependency inference’s file level precision, our test is still quickly and correctly cached, even after editing neighboring files in the target! Productivity preserved; mission accomplished.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The precise, always-accurate dependencies in Pants have a lot of benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>teams can quickly get started using Pants</li>
<li><code>BUILD</code> files (or <code>requirements.txt</code>/<code>setup.py</code> files) can't go out of sync with the code, because you don't need to repeat all of your <code>import</code> statements there</li>
<li>the cache keys for processes (and thus the number of cache hits and amount of rebuilding) are more accurate and much more fine-grained than you would ever write by hand</li>
</ol>

				<span>Advanced Port Forwarding</span>
				<br>
				This is a simple but handy feature with a twist. We issue you ports and you enable ports you select on your device profile(s). Then you simply tell us which port you would like to forward to. No need to configure your client or software to suit us. As an added bonus, you get your very own custom domain name per port. Regardless of which VPN region you connect to, your port-forwarding will always work!

				<br>
				Our built-in DNS filter allows you to decide what internet traffic you want hitting your device(s). Simply populate your filter list with websites that you want blocked and Oeck's VPN will follow those rules and block the traffic. Domain black lists can be set on a per-device level, which makes is perfect for parents who would like to restrict what their children can access. Best of all, it is completely unique to you.

				When selecting a VPN region to connect to, our network runs a check of the available servers and resources within that region. It then calculates which server will be the best server for you to connect to. It takes into account the available system resources of each server and so it will always connect you to the best available server. No more server surfing ever again!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>In the previous part of this article, I have described the basic methods
of getting and setting the baseline registers of 32-bit and 64-bit x86
CPUs.  I have covered General Purpose Registers, baseline Floating-Point
Registers and Debug Registers along with their <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/xsave.svg" alt="XSAVE"></p>

<p>In the second part, I would like to discuss the <code>XSAVE</code> family
of instructions.  I will describe the different variants of this
instruction as well as explain the differences between them and their limitations.
Afterwards, I will compare the <code>ptrace(2)</code> API used to access its data
on Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.  Other systems such as OpenBSD
or DragonFly BSD do not provide requests to retrieve or set extended
registers, so the comparison may help them design their own APIs.</p>

<p>As I’ve explained earlier, the discussed instructions are necessary
to implement <em>context switching</em> — the mechanism used by the Operating
System to run multiple threads and processes quasi-simultaneously
on the same processor.  In order to perform that, the kernel needs
to be able to save the values of all registers used by the program,
and restore them afterwards.  This information is also exposed
to debuggers in order to provide them with means to introspect and alter
the state of debugged programs.</p>

<p>The instructions described in the first part were sufficient to describe
the registers used up to the early generations of Intel Core CPUs.
However, as the next generations of processors introduced new
instruction sets, it eventually became necessary to introduce new
registers as well.  In 2011, the <abbr title="Advanced Vector Extensions">AVX</abbr>
extensions present first in Intel’s Sandy Brige and afterwards in AMD’s
Bulldozer microarchitecture doubled the sizes of earlier XMM registers,
creating 16 new YMM registers.</p>

<p>The new registers can be used to store twice as large vectors of data,
and perform operations on all of their elements simultaneously.  This
is particularly useful for heavy computations, for example in multimedia
or cryptographic applications.  Examples of programs that can explicitly
take advantage of AVX instructions to improve their performance include
the FFmpeg media decoding and encoding library or OpenCV image manipulation
library.</p>

<p>As applications start using the new registers, it becomes necessary
for the kernel to be able to save and restore them as part of context
switching — otherwise the programs would lose data!  The <code>XSAVE</code>
instruction set serves exactly that purpose.  It was introduced
in the newer versions of Intel Core microarchitecture (2008).  It is
used both in the 64-bit and 32-bit mode (although 32-bit programs can use
only a subset of the exposed registers).</p>

<p>The <code>XSAVE</code> instruction extends the format used by <code>FXSAVE</code> to
include additional register sets.  However, unlike the earlier saving
instructions, it is not strictly limited to a fixed data set.  Instead,
it makes it possible to introduce support for new CPU extensions without
the necessity of adding a next <code>XSAVE</code> variant or breaking
compatibility with existing software.  Furthermore, it accounts
for the possibility that some processors may choose not to implement
interim instruction sets.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-components">The State Components</h2>

<p><code>XSAVE</code> revolves around the concept of <em>State Components</em>.  A state
component represents a single subset of data that can be saved or
restored independently.  There are two special state components
corresponding to the original <code>FXSAVE</code> instruction: the x86 state
component, and the SSE state component.  Further instruction sets
introduce one or more components each.</p>

<p>In modern processors, there are two kinds of state components: user state
components and supervisor state components.  The former group represent
regular registers that are accessible to userspace programs, the latter
involves privileged registers that should not be exposed to regular
programs.</p>

<p>The individual state components are controlled via the <em>State Component
Bitmap</em>.  This bitmap is used by <code>XSAVE</code> to determine which
instruction sets to save, and by <code>XRSTOR</code> to determine which to
restore (or reset).  Enabling the respective bits causes additional
data to be saved to the memory, effectively requiring larger storage
area.</p>

<p>In order to make it possible to save a particular state component
or to use the respective registers in a program, the kernel needs
to enable its tracking in one of the control registers.  These control
registers are XCR0 for user components, and IA32_XSS for supervisor
components.  Both use the same bit numbers as the state component
bitmap.</p>

<h2 id="the-xsave-area-format">The XSAVE Area Format</h2>

<p>The data format used by the <code>XSAVE</code> instruction is called the <em>XSAVE
Area</em>.  The XSAVE Area consists of three parts: the 512-byte <em>legacy
region</em> that is the same as used by <code>FXSAVE</code> instruction, followed
by the 64-byte <em>XSAVE header</em> containing information about the data
present in the XSAVE Area, followed by the variably sized <em>extended
region</em> used to store additional state components.</p>

<p>Similarly to <code>FXSAVE</code>, all <code>XSAVE</code> instructions have their -64
counterparts (e.g. <code>XSAVE64</code>) that differ in the way FIP and FDP
registers are saved in the legacy region.  More information on this,
along with a table describing the legacy region in detail, can be found
in the previous part of the article,
<a href="https://www.moritz.systems/blog/how-debuggers-work-getting-and-setting-x86-registers-part-1/#fxsave-vs-fxsave64">FXSAVE vs FXSAVE64</a> section.</p>

<p>The XSAVE header currently contains two 64-bit fields whose values
correspond to the state-component bitmaps: XSTATE_BV and XCOMP_BV.
XSTATE_BV is written by <code>XSAVE</code> to indicate that a particular state
component has been written to the extended region, and read by
<code>XRSTOR</code> to determine whether the component is to be restored
from this region (bit set) or reset to the default state (bit clear).
XCOMP_BV is written by the compacting variants of <code>XSAVE</code> to indicate
that the compact form of XSAVE Area is being used and which components
are present in it, and read by <code>XRSTOR</code> to distinguish this format.</p>

<table>
  <caption>The XSAVE header layout</caption>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>64</th>
    <th>0</th>
    <th>bits</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>XCOMP_BV</td>
    <td>XSTATE_BV</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3" colspan="2">reserved</td>
    <td>128</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>256</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>384</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The extended region can be written either in the standard or compact
format.  In the standard format, each state component is placed
at a fixed offset defined by the processor (and available via
<code>CPUID</code>).  If some of the state components are skipped, the relevant
portion of XSAVE Area is gapped to preserve offsets of the successive
components.  In the compact format, the skipped components do not take
up space, and the remaining components are shifted to minimize space
usage.  Therefore, the offsets depend on the components actually being
written, and need to be calculated by software for every invocation.</p>

<h2 id="invoking-xsave">Invoking XSAVE</h2>

<p>There are a few preliminary steps that need to be done before invoking
any of the <code>XSAVE</code> family of instructions.  I will shortly list them
now.</p>

<p>Firstly, the support for the instruction needs to be verified
via <code>CPUID</code>.  Strictly speaking, the same is also true for <code>FXSAVE</code>.</p>

<p>Secondly, the state tracking needs to be enabled.  This means setting
appropriate state component bits in XCR0 for user state components,
and in IA32_XSS for supervisor state components.  The appropriate XSAVE
bit also needs to be set in the Control Register CR4.  All of this
is done by the kernel.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a buffer large enough for the XSAVE Area needs to be obtained.
The program should use <code>CPUID</code> instruction to obtain the needed
size.  The buffer needs to be aligned to 64 bytes.  Usually, it may
be convenient to zero the buffer first, to avoid having to be careful
e.g. about <code>XSAVE</code> leaving unused XSTATE_BV bytes unmodified.</p>

<p>Finally, the requested state component bitmap needs to be put into
the register pair EDX:EAX (the higher 32 bits into EDX, lower into EAX
— this is a common i386 convention for 64-bit integers).  Once this
is done, <code>XSAVE</code> can be invoked.</p>

<p>Afterwards, another series of <code>CPUID</code> calls are necessary to obtain
offsets or sizes and alignment requirements to process the contents
of the XSAVE Area.</p>

<p>The listing below presents a simple program that calls <code>XSAVE</code> three
times with different register sets modified.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct xsave {
    uint8_t legacy_area[512];
    union {
        struct {
            uint64_t xstate_bv;
            uint64_t xcomp_bv;
        };
        uint8_t header_area[64];
    };
    uint8_t extended_area[];
};

int main() {
    uint32_t buf_size = 0;
    uint32_t avx_offset = 0;
    uint8_t avx_bytes[32];
    struct xsave* buf[3];
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(avx_bytes); ++i)
        avx_bytes[i] = i;

    __asm__ __volatile__ (
        /* check CPUID support for XSAVE and AVX */
        "mov $0x01, %%eax\n\t"
        "cpuid\n\t"
        "mov $0x04000000, %%eax\n\t"  /* bit 26 - XSAVE */

        /* get AVX offset */
        "mov $0x0d, %%eax\n\t"
        "mov $0x02, %%ecx\n\t"

        : "=m"(buf_size), "=m"(avx_offset)
        :
        : "%eax", "%ebx", "%ecx", "%edx"
    );

    if (buf_size == 0) {
        printf("no xsave support\n");

  <p>An international team of scientists has reconstructed the Sun's activity over the last 11 millennia and forecasts decreased activity within a few decades</p>
  

  

  <p>The activity of the Sun over the last 11,400 years, i.e., back to the end of the last ice age on Earth, has now for the first time been reconstructed quantitatively by an international group of researchers led by Sami K. Solanki from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany). The scientists have analyzed the radioactive isotopes in trees that lived thousands of years ago. As the scientists from Germany, Finland, and Switzerland report in the current issue of the science journal "Nature" from October 28, one needs to go back over 8,000 years in order to find a time when the Sun was, on average, as active as in the last 60 years. Based on a statistical study of earlier periods of increased solar activity, the researchers predict that the current level of high solar activity will probably continue only for a few more decades.</p>

<p>The research team had already in 2003 found evidence that the Sun is more active now than in the previous 1000 years. A new data set has allowed them to extend the length of the studied period of time to 11,400 years, so that the whole length of time since the last ice age could be covered. This study showed that the current episode of high solar activity since about the year 1940 is unique within the last 8000 years. This means that the Sun has produced more sunspots, but also more flares and eruptions, which eject huge gas clouds into space, than in the past. The origin and energy source of all these phenomena is the Sun's magnetic field.</p>

<p>Since the invention of the telescope in the early 17th century, astronomers have observed sunspots on a regular basis. These are regions on the solar surface where the energy supply from the solar interior is reduced owing to the strong magnetic fields that they harbour. As a consequence, sunspots are cooler by about 1,500 degrees and appear dark in comparison to their non-magnetic surroundings at an average temperature of 5,800 degrees. The number of sunspots visible on the solar surface varies with the 11-year activity cycle of the Sun, which is modulated by long-term variations. For example, there were almost no sunspots seen during the second half of the 17th century.</p>

<p>For many studies concerning the origin of solar activity and its potential effect on long-term variations of Earth's climate, the interval of time since the year 1610, for which systematic records of sunspots exist, is much too short. For earlier times the level of solar activity must be derived from other data. Such information is stored on Earth in the form of "cosmogenic" isotopes. These are radioactive nuclei resulting from collisions of energetic cosmic ray particles with air molecules in the upper atmosphere. One of these isotopes is C-14, radioactive carbon with a half life of 5730 years, which is well known from the C-14 method to determine the age of wooden objects. The amount of C-14 produced depends strongly on the number of cosmic ray particles that reach the atmosphere. This number, in turn, varies with the level of solar activity: during times of high activity, the solar magnetic field provides an effective shield against these energetic particles, while the intensity of the cosmic rays increases when the activity is low. Therefore, higher solar activity leads to a lower production rate of C-14, and vice versa.</p>

<p>By mixing processes in the atmosphere, the C-14 produced by cosmic rays reaches the biosphere and part of it is incorporated in the biomass of trees. Some tree trunks can be recovered from below the ground thousands of years after their death and the content of C-14 stored in their tree rings can be measured. The year in which the C-14 had been incorporated is determined by comparing different trees with overlapping life spans. In this way, one can measure the production rate of C-14 backward in time over 11,400 years, right to the end of the last ice age. The research group have used these data to calculate the variation of the number of sunspots over these 11,400 years. The number of sunspots is a good measure also for the strength of the various other phenomena of solar activity.</p>

<p>The method of reconstructing solar activity in the past, which describes each link in the complex chain connecting the isotope abundances with the sunspot number with consistent quantitative physical models, has been tested and gauged by comparing the historical record of directly measured sunspot numbers with earlier shorter reconstructions on the basis of the cosmogenic isotope Be-10 in the polar ice shields. The models concern the production of the isotopes by cosmic rays, the modulation of the cosmic ray flux by the interplanetary magnetic field (the open solar magnetic flux), as well as the relation between the large-scale solar magnetic field and the sunspot number. In this way, for the first time a quantitatively reliable reconstruction of the sunspot number for the whole time since the end of the last ice age could be obtained.</p>
<figure data-description="Top: Reconstructed sunspot activity (10 year average) for the last 11,400 years based on C-14 data (blue curve) and the directly observed historical sunspot data since 1610 (red curve). The reliable C-14 data ends around the year 1900 so that the sharp increase in sunspot activity in the 20th century does not appear in the graph.

          Top: Reconstructed sunspot activity (10 year average) for the last 11,400 years based on C-14 data (blue curve) and the directly observed historical sunspot data since 1610 (red curve). The reliable C-14 data ends around the year 1900 so that the sharp increase in sunspot activity in the 20th century does not appear in the graph. The reconstruction shows clearly that a comparable period of high sunspot activity previously existed over 8000 years ago. Below: An enlarged section of the upper graph (hatched area) with several episodes of higher sun activity; comparable to the 20th century.

<p>Because the brightness of the Sun varies slightly with solar activity, the new reconstruction indicates also that the Sun shines somewhat brighter today than in the 8,000 years before. Whether this effect could have provided a significant contribution to the global warming of the Earth during the last century is an open question. The researchers around Sami K. Solanki stress the fact that solar activity has remained on a roughly constant (high) level since about 1980 - apart from the variations due to the 11-year cycle - while the global temperature has experienced a strong further increase during that time. On the other hand, the rather similar trends of solar activity and terrestrial temperature during the last centuries (with the notable exception of the last 20 years) indicates that the relation between the Sun and climate remains a challenge for further research.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>In this article, we will compare one apple (IntelliJ Rust) to one orange (rust-analyzer) to reach general and sweeping conclusions.
Specifically, I want to present a case study supporting the following claim:</p>
<p>For complex applications, Rust is as productive as Kotlin.</p>
<p>For me, this is an unusual claim to argue: I always thought exactly the opposite, but I am not so sure now.
I came to Rust from C++.
I was of the opinion that this is a brilliant low-level language and always felt puzzled at people writing higher-level things in Rust.
Clearly, choosing Rust means taking a productivity hit, and using Kotlin, C# or Go just makes much more sense if you can afford GC.
My <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">list of Rust criticisms</a> starts with this objection.</p>
<p>What moved my position in the other direction was my experience as the lead developer of rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust.
Let me introduce the two projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><strong>IntelliJ Rust</strong></a> is the plugin for IntelliJ Platform, providing Rust support.
In effect, it is a Rust compiler front-end, written in Kotlin and making use of language-support features of the platform.
These features include lossless syntax trees, a parser generator, persistence and indexing infrastructure, among others.
Nonetheless, as programming languages differ lot, the bulk of logic for analyzing Rust is implemented in the plugin itself.
Presentational features like completion list come from the platform, but most of the language semantics is hand-written.
IntelliJ Rust also includes a bit of a Swing GUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer"><strong>rust-analyzer</strong></a> is an implementation of
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Rust.
It is a Rust compiler front-end written from scratch with an eye towards IDE support.
It makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">salsa</a> library for incremental computations.
Beyond the compiler itself, rust-analyzer includes code for managing long-lived multithreaded process of the language server itself.</p>
<p>The projects are essentially equivalent in scope — rust compiler front-ends suitable for IDEs.
The two biggest differences are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IntelliJ Rust is a plugin, so it can re-use code and design patterns of the surrounding platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rust-analyzer is the second system, so it leverages experience of IntelliJ Rust for a from-scratch design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The internal architecture of the two projects also differs a lot.
In terms of <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">Three Architectures</a>, IntelliJ Rust is map-reduce, and rust-analyzer is query-based.</p>
<p>Writing an IDE-ready compiler is a high-level task.
You don’t need to talk to the operating system directly.
There are some fancy data structures and concurrency here and there, but they are also high-level.
It’s not about implementing crazy lock-free schemes, it’s about maintaining application state and sanity in the multithreaded world.
The bulk of the compiler is symbolic manipulation, arguably best suited for lisp.
Picking a VM-based language for such task (for example, OCaml), doesn’t have any intrinsic downsides.</p>
<p>At the same time, the task is pretty complex and unique.
The ratio of “your code” vs “framework code” when implementing features is much higher than in a typical CRUD backend.</p>
<p>Now that the projects are introduced, lets take two roughly equivalent slices of history.</p>

<p>Both are about 2 years old, with 1-1.5 developers working full time and vibrant and thriving community of open-source contributors.
There are 52k lines of Kotlin and 66k lines of Rust.</p>
<p>Both delivered roughly equivalent feature sets at that time.
To be honest, I still don’t really believe this :)
rust-analyzer started from zero, it didn’t have a decade worth of Java classes to bootstrap from, and the productivity drop between Kotlin and Rust is supposed to be huge.
But it’s hard to argue with reality.
Instead, let me try to reflect on my experience building both, and to try to explain Rust’s surprising productivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_learning_curve">Learning Curve</h2>
<div>
<p>It’s easy to characterize Kotlin’s learning curve — it is nearly zero.
I’ve started IntelliJ Rust without Kotlin experience and never felt that I need to specifically learn Kotlin.</p>
<p>When I switched to rust-analyzer, I was pretty experienced with Rust.
I would say that one definitely needs to deliberately learn Rust, it’s hard to pick it up on the go.
Ownership and aliasing control are novel concepts (even if you come from C++), and taking holistic approach to learning them pays off.
After the initial learning step the ride is generally smooth.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the perfect place to plug our Rust courses and tailor-made <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/">trainings</a> :-)
The next <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/#package-intro-training">introduction to Rust</a> is happening this December!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_modularity">Modularity</h2>
<div>
<p>This I think is the biggest factor.
Both projects are moderately large in terms of scope as well as in terms of amount of source code.
I believe that the only way to ship big things is to split them in independent-ish chunks and implement the chunks separately.</p>
<p>I also find most of the languages I am familiar with to be pretty horrible with respect to modularity.
More generally, I am amused with FP vs OO debate, as it seems that “why no one does modules right?” is a more salient issue.</p>
<p>Rust is one of the few languages which has first-class concept of libraries.
Rust code is organized on two levels:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as a tree of inter-dependent modules inside a crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as a directed acyclic graph of crates</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Cyclic dependencies are allowed between the modules, but not between the crates.
Crates are units of reuse and privacy: only crate’s public API matters, and it is crystal clear what crate’s public API is.
Moreover, crates are anonymous, so you don’t get name conflicts and dependency hell when mixing several versions of the same crate in a single crate graph.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to make two pieces of code <strong>not</strong> depend on each other (non-dependencies are the essence of modularity): just put them in separate crates.
During code review, only changes to Cargo.tomls need to be monitored carefully.</p>
<p>At the time of comparison, rust-analyzer is split into 23 internal crates, with a handful general-purposed ones released on crates.io.
In contrast, IntelliJ Rust is a single Kotlin module, where everything can depend on everything else.
Although internal organization of IntelliJ Rust is pretty clean, it’s not reflected in the file system layout and build system, and needs constant maintenance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_build_system">Build System</h2>
<div>
<p>Managing project’s build takes significant amount of times, and has multiplicative effect on everything else.</p>
<p>Rust’s build system, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a>, is very good.
It’s not perfect, but it is a breath of fresh air after Java’s <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo’s trick is that it doesn’t try to be a general purpose build system.
It can only build Rust projects, and it has rigid expectation about the project structure.
It’s impossible to opt out of the core assumptions.
Configuration is a static non-extensible TOML file.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gradle allows free-form project structure, and is configured via a Turing complete language.
I feel like I’ve spend more time learning Gradle than learning Rust!
Running <code>wc -w</code> gives 182_817 words for Rust book, and 280_506 for Gradle’s user guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cargo is just faster than Gradle in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest downside is that custom build logic is not expressible in Cargo.
Both projects needs substantial amount of logic beyond mere compilation to deliver the final result to the user.
For rust-analyzer, this is handled by hand-written Rust script, which works perfectly at this scale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<div>
<p>Language-level support for libraries and top-notch build system/package manager allow for a thriving ecosystem.
rust-analyzer relies on third-party libraries much more than IntelliJ Rust.
Some parts of rust-analyzer are also published to crates.io for other projects to reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-level nature of the Rust programming language often allows for “perfect” library interfaces.
Interfaces which exactly reflect the underlying problem, without imposing intermediate language-level abstractions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_basic_conveniences">Basic Conveniences</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel that Rust is significantly more productive when it comes to basic language nuts and bolts — structs, enums, functions, etc.
This is not specific to Rust — any ML-family language has them.
However, Rust is the first industrial language which wraps these features in a nice package, not constrained by backwards compatibility.
I want to list specific features which I think allow producing maintainable code faster in Rust</p>
<p><em>Emphasis on data over behavior</em>.
Aka, Rust is not an OOP language.
The core idea of OOP is that of dynamic dispatch — which code is invoked by a function call is decided at runtime (late binding).
This is a powerful pattern which allows for flexible and extensible system.
The problem is, extensibility is costly!
It’s better only to apply it in certain designated areas.
Designing for extensibility by default is not cost effective.
Rust puts static dispatch front and center: it is mostly clear whats going on by just reading the code, as it is independent of runtime types of the objects.</p>
<p>One small syntactic thing I enjoy about Rust is how it puts fields and methods into different blocks syntactically:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>first_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
  <span>last_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>full_name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Being able to see at a glance all the fields makes understanding the code much simpler.
Fields convey much more information than methods.</p>
<p><em>Sum types</em>.
Rust’s humbly named enums are full algebraic data types.
This means that you can express the idea of disjoint union:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>),</span> <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is hugely useful in day-to-day programming in the small, and some times during programming in the large as well.
To give one example, one of the core concepts for an IDE are references and definitions.
A definition a like <code>let foo = 92;</code> assigns a name to an entity which can be used down a line.
A reference like <code>foo + 90</code> <em>refers</em> to some definition.
When you ctrl-click on reference, you go to the definition.</p>
<p>Natural way to model that in Kotlin is by adding <code>interface Definition</code> and <code>interface Reference</code>.
The problem is, some things are …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>If you run a SaaS business,&nbsp;there&nbsp;are plenty of great reasons why you might want to sell it one day. Whether you’re looking to take some chips off the table or move on to the next project, it can often make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about selling, you’ll find that there is no shortage of resources on <a href="https://feinternational.com/blog/saas-metrics-value-saas-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to value a SaaS business</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://tylertringas.com/selling-my-bootstrapped-saas-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to go about selling it</a>. However, there’s not nearly as much emphasis placed on the merits of holding on to a SaaS business and going the distance.</p>
<p>As someone who’s run a SaaS business for the past 5 years and someone who’s participated in a few acquisition talks, I’ve grown to appreciate some of the benefits of maintaining ownership. As a result, I thought it would be interesting to present some of the reasons why you might NOT want to sell your SaaS business.</p>
<p>Now, my goal here is not to convince you to never sell your business. In fact, I think it’s important to operate your business as though you <em>could</em>&nbsp;sell if you wanted to.</p>
<p>Rather, my goal is simply to point out some of the things you might not be thinking of. That way, you can make a more informed decision about whether or not it makes sense to sell your business after considering all of your own unique circumstances.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that for the sake of this post I’m mainly talking about “financial acquisitions” where buyers are typically offering 3-5x multiples of annual <a href="https://www.quietlightbrokerage.com/sellers-discretionary-income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seller’s discretionary earnings (SDE)</a>. If a strategic buyer comes along and offers you a crazy multiple for your business,&nbsp;then you should probably take the deal.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, here are some of the reasons you might not want to sell your SaaS business.</p>
<h2 id="h.sdhy6tlrdfd1">1. You’ll probably leave money on the table</h2>
<p>Back in 2017, I met a fairly well known marketer and founder who’s acquired a few SaaS apps and grew them into highly profitable businesses. After chatting with him for a while, he mentioned that if we were ever considering selling Snappa to let him know.</p>
<p>At the time, we weren’t actively looking to sell Snappa but I was curious to find out how they would value our business and what valuation he’d be willing to pay.</p>
<p>After sharing some of our metrics and describing how we ran the business, him and his business partner passed on making an offer. He mentioned&nbsp;that they couldn’t find any low hanging fruit and felt that acquiring it for more than a 3x SDE multiple would leave them with little margin of safety. At the time, we were only doing $33k in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) so even if we had sold for a 5x multiple we would have left <strong>significant</strong>&nbsp;money on the table.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the spring of 2019 and we received an email from a potential acquirer who’s been very interested in Snappa over the past few years. Every time he expressed interest in buying Snappa, I politely declined and said we didn’t have much interest in selling given the growth trajectory we were on.</p>
<p>This time around, he seemed very motivated to make a deal and was throwing around multiples on the very high end of what a financial acquisition would typically go for. After sharing our metrics and opening up the books, he made a very attractive offer which kicked off due diligence from the both of us.</p>
<p>Long story short, some issues cropped up during the deal and we ultimately pulled out of it. The good news is that it ended up being a <em>huge</em>&nbsp;blessing in disguise and completely changed my thoughts around selling our business.</p>
<p>Bringing it back to financials though, we again would have left <strong>a lot </strong>of money on the table had we sold. While we were negotiating a sale price, Snappa was generating $67k MRR. Today, Snappa generates $134k MRR, which is exactly <strong>double</strong>&nbsp;what we were generating just a year and a half ago!</p>
<p>More importantly, Snappa has gotten even more profitable as we’ve continued to spread more revenue over fewer costs. To put this all into perspective, we could probably sell Snappa for 2.5x more today than we could have back in the spring of 2019.</p>
<p>To illustrate this even more clearly, here’s a graph showing our all-time MRR and when these potential deals were being discussed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/acquisition-talks.jpg" alt="acquisition talks" width="1600" height="688" srcset="https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/acquisition-talks.jpg 1600w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/acquisition-talks-300x129.jpg 300w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/acquisition-talks-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/acquisition-talks-768x330.jpg 768w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/acquisition-talks-1536x660.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></p><p>You can see that our business has grown consistently over time and that selling it at any point along the way would have been a mistake. Although this post suffers from survivorship bias and our growth has accelerated due to the coronavirus, it is not uncommon at all for SaaS businesses to continue growing for many years. After all, this is the biggest benefit of starting a SaaS business; it might take a while to get going but once you’ve got product/market fit they usually keep compounding.</p>
<p>The ultimate point I want to make is this:</p>
<p><em>If your business continues to grow (even modestly), it will never make sense to sell it for a 3-5x SDE multiple, strictly from a financial standpoint. </em></p>
<p>The only caveat here is whether or not you can deploy the sale proceeds into another project/investment that will yield an ever higher rate of return than your current business.</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that if your SDE gets high enough, holding out for the sake of more money becomes less important. If you net $3M – $5M after-tax from the sale of your SaaS business and park the proceeds in an index fund, <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a safe withdrawal rate of 4%</a>&nbsp;would give you $120k – $200k of income. This would essentially give you an infinite runway if you really just want to move on to the next thing.</p>
<h2 id="h.5qi198x8pile">2. You’ll lose a reliable income stream</h2>
<p>When you’re thinking about selling your business, visualizing a huge chunk of cash in your bank account sounds very appealing. If your SaaS generates $25k of SDE per month, you could sell it for somewhere between $1M – $1.5M.</p>
<p>Aside from the large tax bill you’ll have to pay, there are other issues with trading a reliable income stream for a lump sum of cash…</p>
<p>Without an additional income stream, you will need to dip into that $1M in order to pay for your living expenses. If you don’t get another project off the ground in a reasonable time frame, you will then start depleting your savings.</p>
<p>The other problem is that cash in your bank account will continue to rot and lose purchasing power every single year. And with interest rates currently pegged at 0%, you’ll be forced to invest this money in the stock market (<a href="https://chrisgimmer.com/bitcoin-reserve-asset/">or bitcoin</a>) just to keep up with inflation.</p>
<p>Now imagine if you sold your SaaS business back in February 2019 and you parked your money in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. Just one month later, $1M would have decreased to $672k. How would that make you feel? Would you have stomached the volatility?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the markets have rebounded very quickly (mostly thanks to QE + stimulus), but the S&amp;P 500 is currently trading below the February 2019 peak. This means that, financially speaking, you’d be worse off today than you would have been when you sold your business.</p>
<h2 id="h.xutqxbophzg7"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sp500-return.jpg" alt="S&amp;P 500 returns" width="1600" height="939" srcset="https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sp500-return.jpg 1600w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sp500-return-300x176.jpg 300w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sp500-return-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sp500-return-768x451.jpg 768w, https://chrisgimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sp500-return-1536x901.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></h2>
<p>In my case, short-term volatility doesn’t bother me at all when it comes to investing. When the market crashed in March, I watched my portfolio of high growth tech stocks get crushed along with my personal investment in bitcoin. However, I didn’t panic or make any rash decisions because I don’t rely on these investments to pay the bills or perform in the short-term. Thanks to this patience, my portfolio has not only recovered, but it has significantly outperformed the broader market this year.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I was able to remain calm is because I have a SaaS business that kicks off reliable cash flow. This allows me to focus my investing on highly attractive long-term opportunities without worrying about short-term volatility. So far in my investing career, this has worked out very well.</p>
<p>If we had sold Snappa and I needed to protect my nest egg, I likely would have changed my investing approach to something more conservative in order to avoid big drawdowns. This would have put me in a much worse position than I’m in today.</p>
<h2 id="h.3uryscj59qwu">3. Acquisitions can be distracting</h2>
<p>When selling a business, something that often gets overlooked is the time, resources, and mental energy that’s required during the process. Depending on the size and complexity of the deal, you may need to dedicate the majority of your time over several months to ensure that the deal closes. If you want a detailed account of what this can look like, I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-298-a-startup-acquisition-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Walling’s account of the Drip acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Every hour that you spend on acquisition talks or due diligence is an hour that you’re not spending on growing your businesses. Also, the further down the process you get, and the more time that you sink in, the more demoralizing it becomes if the deal doesn’t close.</p>
<p>Another thing worth considering is how you choose to communicate with employees. Obviously, you don’t want to tell your employees about an acquisition at the LOI stage when the buyer hasn’t done the full due diligence. However, as part of the due diligence, or as the deal approaches closing, you may need to loop in some of your key employees. If the deal doesn’t go through, your employees could then get spooked and start looking for opportunities elsewhere if they think you’re going to sell the company.</p>
<h2 id="h.cvcpn4f4m311">4. You’ll have to say goodbye to your team</h2>
<p>Speaking of employees, <a href="https://chrisgimmer.com/building-a-great-team/">building an amazing team</a>&nbsp;has been one of the most rewarding parts about being a founder. It truly is a joy to work with every single person on our team. Although we only hired our first employee in 2016, I’m happy to say that not a single person has left the company.</p>
<p>In addition to all the time we’ve spent working together remotely, we’ve also had some amazing in-person experiences and created lasting memories that I’ll never forget. For these reasons, it would be really hard to say goodbye to all of the great people that I work with.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, ‘A’ players are also worth their weight in gold and are not easily replaced. Given the inherent leverage embedded in a SaaS business, a programmer or marketer who’s 2x better than their counterpart can realistically provide 5x better returns for the business.</p>
<p>If you sell off the business and …</p></div></div>

          <p>Apple is running an "Entrepreneur Camp" for black founders and applications are open. As far as I can tell it's their first go at it. Previously they've run events for female founders.</p>
<p>If you get in you'll supposedly get access to assistance from Apple engineers. I don't know how extensive that access will actually be, but I'm dying to find out. Here's my application. Apple's questions are in bold and my answers in regular. Wish me luck :)</p>

<p><strong>Organization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Apple Entrepreneur Camp is for organizations worldwide with a Black founder, co-founder, or CEO. Each organization may bring up to three attendees. The Black founder, co-founder, or CEO and at least one Black developer (if not a sole proprietorship) must attend. The third attendee may be any racial background.</strong></p>
<p>Oivvio Polite</p>
<p><strong>App Name</strong></p>
<p>Season</p>
<p><strong>Website</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://seasonpods.com/">seasonpods.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Describe your organization’s mission in one sentence.</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately to liberate people through the use of technology, but on a day to day basis I run it to pay the bills :)</p>
<p>Season is a podcast player containing only limited series and audio drama where one story is told over multiple episodes. These kinds of podcasts are very popular but are sort of shoehorned in to the podcast format that is centered around free standing episodes, feeds and subscriptions. In a regular podcast player it can actually be a bit tricky to 1) find this content and 2) to play all episodes in the right order.</p>
<p><strong>Company Size</strong></p>
<p>Sole proprietorship/single person business</p>
<p><strong>Number of Black Developers Employed by Your Company</strong></p>
<p>1 - 2</p>
<p><strong>What is the technical skill level of your development team on Apple platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Intermediate</p>
<p><strong>Has your organization received any investments or grants from external investors?</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to raise money in the future?</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>Are you the founder, co-founder, or CEO?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>If selected, will you be managing your organization’s involvement with the program?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<h2>Your App</h2>
<p><strong>Apple Entrepreneur Camp is designed to provide code level assistance as you create your next generation app using native Apple technologies. You must have a developed app or fully functional build that you can demo live.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How far along are you in the development of your app?</strong></p>
<p>Available on the App Store</p>
<p><strong>TestFlight, App Store, or .IPA download link</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/se/app/season-podcasts/id1504295207">https://apps.apple.com/se/app/season-podcasts/id1504295207</a></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about the app you’re developing. What problem is it trying to solve?</strong></p>
<p>The app is live in the App Store but limited to Sweden for the time being. Here's the TestFlight link: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/OPSYw5qV">https://testflight.apple.com/join/OPSYw5qV</a> usable in all regions.</p>
<p>Season is a podcast player containing only limited series and audio drama where one story is told over multiple episodes. These kinds of podcasts are very popular but are sort of shoehorned in to the podcast format that is centered around standalone episodes, feeds and subscriptions.</p>
<p>In a regular podcast player it can actually be a bit tricky to 1) find this content and 2) play all episodes in the right order.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your app intended for and what solutions do they currently use? What’s unique about your solution?</strong></p>
<p>People who enjoy binging on well produced limited series and audio drama podcasts. Today they are using Apple podcasts and Spotify. Limited series are heavily over represented in the Apple podcasts charts which is a strong indicator that an app specifically for this kind of content could do well.</p>
<p>Half of what makes Season better is the curation. If you're into limited series Season makes it sooo much easier to find stuff you'll like. The other half is the player experience that is tailored to multi episode shows, using the <strong>season</strong> rather than the feed as it's central organizational unit.</p>
<p><strong>On which platforms do you plan to release your app?</strong></p>
<p>iOS</p>
<p>iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>What key Apple technologies have you integrated or do you plan to integrate into your app?</strong></p>
<p>SwiftUI</p>
<p><strong>What developer tools do you currently use?</strong></p>
<p>Xcode</p>
<p><strong>What programming languages do you currently use for app development?
Swift</strong></p>
<p>Swift</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p><strong>Describe your strategy and road map for apps on Apple platforms, including new deployments, over the next 6, 12, or 24 months.</strong></p>
<p>I just released the app to the App Store last week, limiting it to the Swedish region. Over the next two months, using feedback from early users, I'll be polishing the app. I'm not really adding any features I'm just making the ones that are already in there look and work better. When that's done, hopefully before the end of the year I'll release to all regions. In early 2021 I hope to be able to focus more on getting the word out and reaching users.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to gain from attending?</strong></p>
<p>Access to Apple engineers to help me with the code sounds like a complete dream. There have been so many times throughout this project that I've wished for something like that. I don't think that you'll be shocked to hear that your docs aren't always that helpful.</p>
<p>Beyond coding, getting more insights into the business side of having an app in the store would be tremendous. (This is my weak point. I have zero business experience.) Other than building a great app, what can I do to find my users?</p>
<p>Also getting to connect with other black techies would be fun.</p>
<p><strong>How would you define your success after attending?</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure this would be a great learning experience outside of any other outcomes. But viewed as a step on my journey to being successful as an indie app developer I'd also like to but a quantitative measure on it.
Let's say 10000 daily users by the end of 2021!</p>
<p><strong>If you are a for-profit business, how does your organization plan to sell and market its products/services?</strong></p>
<p>I plan to sell ad-space in the app for podcasts. A couple of other small podcast players are already doing this so it's a proven business model. I'm rather confident that I can make that work as long as I'm able to get a sufficient amount of users.</p>
<p><strong>If you've shared or considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others, let us know.</strong></p>
<p>I've done some teaching to design and illustration-students at a local arts collage (<a href="https://www.konstfack.se/">Konstfack</a>) here in Stockholm. I really enjoy it and would like to do more of it but the amount time of time I can devote to teaching is limited since the pay is abysmal.</p>

<p>Imagine you’ve made two decisions. One has resulted in a loss of 10 thousand dollars, while the other resulted in a gain of 10 thousand dollars. Would you say that the former was a bad decision, and the latter was a good one?</p>



<p>The first response that usually comes to everyone’s mind is “of course, the second decision was better”. But this is not necessarily the case. Can you think of a scenario where your response would be the opposite?</p>



<p>I’ve been thinking and reading about decision-making for many years while trying to put everything I learned into practice. Below, I summarize the strategies and mental models that I personally found most useful.</p>



<h2>The Process vs. The Outcome</h2>



<p>We all have a natural tendency to judge decisions based on their outcomes. This is not the worst heuristic, as there is a correlation between the quality of decisions and outcomes. But this heuristic has a major flaw — it doesn’t account for luck and incomplete information.</p>



<p>An individual can make a bad impulse decision yet get lucky and get a positive outcome. An extreme example could be buying a lottery ticket and winning. A less extreme example could be taking a high-stakes risky business decision without putting much thought into it. Should those decisions still be considered <em>good?</em></p>



<p>On the other hand, another individual might dedicate the appropriate time to making a business decision, follow a thorough process, analyze all the available information, make the reasonable conclusions, and make an educated long-term bet. Now imagine that the business environment transforms in the upcoming years in a way <em>that could not have been predicted.</em> So the decision leads to a negative outcome. For example, a product launch fails. Does it mean the decision was bad?</p>



<p>Arguably, the first individual made a bad decision, and the second one made a good one. This might contradict conventional wisdom, but if you really think about it, the first person simply got lucky after following a bad process. And the second person did everything they could to make the optimal decision and took a calculated risk. That the outcome wasn’t positive in this particular case doesn’t tell us much about the person’s decision-making ability or judgment.</p>



<p>One reason it’s so hard to evaluate the process instead of the outcome in the business context is that it flies in the face of many other best practices. Hiring managers believe that past performance is the best predictor of success. Leaders extol results-driven culture. OKRs are set around outcomes — not processes.</p>



<p>But a deeper reason is that it’s more difficult to evaluate and establish processes. It’s much easier to evaluate results. Evaluating processes would require a deeper understanding of the context and how that context has evolved over time. It would also require disentangling various drivers of the outcome. You might be thinking… Who’s got time for <em>that</em>?</p>



<p>Realistically, I don’t see the outcome-based evaluation of decisions going away completely any time soon. But it doesn’t mean we cannot iteratively improve the process so we get better over time.</p>



<p>So what can we do to improve the process?</p>



<h2>Decision Journal</h2>



<p>A simple yet powerful idea is to document big decisions. Just like venture capitalists prepare <a href="https://www.bvp.com/memos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed investment memos</a> before investing in startups where they weigh all the pros and cons, we can also write summaries for big decisions in business and life.</p>



<p>In addition to outlining all the available options and considering their pros and cons, here are some additional things to consider.</p>



<h2>The Main Goal and Frameworks</h2>



<p>Asking “what are we optimizing for?” might sound obvious but clarifying what you’re optimizing for can simplify the entire process. </p>



<p>Asking this question is particularly useful when a group of people is making a decision. You might assume that everyone has the same goal in mind, but once you ask, you might realize that people might have different opinions about the most important goal or metric to optimize for.</p>



<p>And if you’re into spreadsheets, you can even come up with a list of criteria and assign weights to calculate the expected outcomes. For example:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-13.36.33.png" alt="Decision-making framework: options, criteria, weights, payoffs, and expected value." width="786" height="245" srcset="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-13.36.33.png 1048w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-13.36.33-480x149.png 480w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-13.36.33-666x207.png 666w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-13.36.33-768x239.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px"></figure></div>



<p>Expected value = the probability of a certain outcome * the payoff in case of this outcome. </p>



<p>The payoff can either be expressed in monetary value or subjectively perceived value — for example, how happy you would be on the 10-point scale.</p>



<p>Developing a framework like this can be useful for thinking and clarifying what really matters to you and aligning with others. But quantifying things can also give you a false sense of confidence so I’d use this approach with caution.</p>



<p>Want to take it up a notch? Look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decision trees</a>.</p>



<h2>Expected Value vs. the Worst Possible Downside</h2>



<p>Besides considering the most likely outcome or the expected value, I find it very useful to consider the worst possible downside.</p>



<p>Imagine you have two investment opportunities. One is expected to grow 7% annually on average in the long-term and the other is expected to grow 10%. Based on this information alone, the second one looks like a better investment. At least until you account for volatility. The extreme case of volatility is that the investment goes to zero or close to zero.</p>



<p>I personally find it useful to think about the worst possible outcome I would be comfortable with in addition to considering the expected value.</p>



<p>What if I told you that the value of the first investment has less than a 0.01% chance of dropping to near zero, while the value of the second investment has a 20% chance of doing so, how would it change your decision?</p>



<h2>A Portfolio of Bets</h2>



<p>Your response to the previous question might have been “it depends”. It might depend on a number things — such as your risk aversion, personal situation, or whether this is the only investment or one of many.</p>



<p>The portfolio approach is often used in finance. It’s been shown that most people would be better off allocating most of their investments into low-fee portfolios that track the overall market rather than picking individual stocks. Similarly, venture capitalists always spread out their investments across many startups.</p>



<p>And a similar framework can be applied in business and life — it’s sometimes useful to ask yourself a question “am I making and testing multiple bets here or primarily committing to one thing?”</p>



<h2>Optionality vs. Efficiency</h2>



<p>It’s useful to consider the trade-off between future optionality and efficiency.</p>



<p>Some business decisions might bring in more revenue or reduce costs, but they reduce your future options. Many companies optimize for efficiency so they could grow faster or improve their bottom line. Generally, public markets and quarterly financial reporting also incentivize them to do so. But sometimes over-optimizing leads to reduced optionality in the future.</p>



<p>Nassim Taleb developed and popularized the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antifragility</a> which is highly related to optionality. Wikipedia describes antifragility as “a property of systems that increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures”.</p>



<p>What’s interesting is that sometimes building a system like this or putting yourself in a situation like this requires a certain redundancy which is the opposite of efficiency.</p>



<p>The PPE shortage in the US during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is sometimes viewed as a recent example of optimizing for efficiency at the expense of optionality. If you focus on efficiency and optimize for the short-term demand, you might choose to store only a limited amount “just in case” and purchase the equipment from countries that can provide it at a lowest cost. However, if you want to optimize for optionality, resilience, and antifragility, you might choose to have more redundant storage and manufacture some equipment internally — so you don’t rely on other countries as much.</p>



<p>Similarly, certain choices in life and business create more options in the future than others.</p>



<h2>Let People Form Their Own Opinions First</h2>



<p>To quote Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel prize-winning psychologist and economist:</p>



<p><em>“Subjectively, it feels like you believe in something because you have the arguments for it. But it works the other way around. You believe in the conclusion, and then you create supporting arguments. That’s fundamental. Why do people believe in these conclusions? Partly because people we love and trust believe in the same conclusion.”</em></p>



<p>Our brains are naturally biased to pay attention to what others believe and generally follow them. So if one person in a group confidently announces their opinion first, many people will be likely to follow them. You can see this effect on steroids if that first-to-speak person is a boss.</p>



<p>This is why it’s usually better to ask people to form their opinions first and, ideally, write them down before discussing them with others. I made sure my team utilized this strategy when running customer research and focus groups with multiple people being interviewed at a time. Before discussing a topic as a group, we would present participants with a question and then ask them to write their opinions before discussing them. This always leads to a greater diversity of ideas.</p>



<h2>First Principles Thinking</h2>



<p>It’s also been shown that people are more likely to accept evidence that is supporting their pre-existing beliefs and more likely to challenge evidence that is contradicting them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motivated reasoning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation bias</a> are well researched.</p>



<p>First-principles reasoning is the opposite of that. You don’t reason by analogy, assume that things can only be the way they are today, or copy what others believe.</p>



<p>Instead, you start with the underlying, well-established facts and build your beliefs and conclusions independently based on these facts.</p>



<p>Or you can start by considering commonly held beliefs and deconstructing them with the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five whys</a>” …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The subject of Artificial Intelligence picks my interest and I’m constantly studying and trying new things in this field.</p><p>It is notorious how the technologies related to Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and such have emerged and evolved into solutions used by millions of users every day.</p><p>Even though people use the term "Artificial Intelligence", we are still far away from something as advanced as a Skynet from the Terminator movies.</p><p>The most common subfield of AI used today is the one called Machine Learning, which, in its turn, has Deep Learning as subfield steeply growing every day for quite some time now.</p><p>In this guide, I aim to describe a path to follow for software engineers to begin understanding how Machine Learning works and how to apply it to your projects.</p><p>Yeah, you can just go to Google API’s or Amazon and pick some magical API to do Speech Recognition for you, but the value of knowing how it works, why it works and even more, how to make your own API as a Service and tune it to your specific needs is incredible.</p><p>Remember, as a developer, every tool is a new power.</p><p>I’ve read, watched and gone through all these resources until the end, even got a paid certification for some, even though it is not necessary to learn, I find myself more engaged to finish when I have some deadline and assessment to prove I actually learned the material.</p><p>Let’s dive into the topics.</p><h2>The Basics: Math!</h2><p>Maybe you never had the chance to study some college-level math, or you did study it but you can’t remember most of the stuff because JavaScript and CSS took all the memory of those topics away.</p><p>There are 3 topics you must know beforehand, or at least have a decent grasp of to follow any good material on ML and DL: Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics.</p><p>If you’d like to go deep in learning the math needed to ML and DL, you can look for MIT OpenCourseWare classes like Professor Strang’s renowned <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">Linear Algebra</a> class.</p><p>I’ve watched it in college in parallel with my regular class and it is very good.</p><p>But, let’s face it, most people have no time for that or the patience.</p><p>So I will give you the crash course for the 3 topics mentioned above.</p><h3>Linear Algebra</h3><p>Just watch the whole series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a> from the Youtube channel 3Blue1Brown.</p><p>The guy makes visual explanations of once hard concepts incredibly easy!</p><p>It is very far in terms of content compared to Professor Strang’s, but it’s enough, to begin with, and you can go after other topics as you advance in ML and DL.</p><h3>Calculus</h3><p>Guess what?</p><p>3Blue1Brown also has a whole series on Calculus on Youtube for you to watch for free: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a>.</p><p>Again, he is very good at giving you the intuition of why and how rather than just throw some random equations on your face.</p><h3>Statistics</h3><p>This is a whole field that, in my opinion, you can learn as needed, a good reference is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962">Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts</a>.</p><p>An objective book with some good examples for every concept.</p><p>Fast to read too.</p><p>As the title implies, it is more suitable for Data Scientists, but understanding some basics of statistics is always good and this is what this is book is for.</p><p>You won’t become a statistician after reading it, but you will learn some good stuff.</p><h2>The Bypassed: Machine Learning</h2><p>Everybody wants to jump straight into Deep Learning and be the cool guy training a single model for a week on a 12GB GPU.</p><p>But to get Deep Learning right, you need to go through Machine Learning first!</p><h3>Start from the beginning</h3><p>The concepts, the train of thought, the "feeling" of how things work start here and there is no one else more capable of teaching those concepts than Professor Andrew Ng in his course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>.</p><p>You may think this course is old and outdated, well, technology-wise, maybe, but conceptually-wise, it is better than anything else out there.</p><p>Professor Ng makes it easy to understand the math applied in every technique he teaches and gives you a solid understanding of what happens underneath in a very short and concise course.</p><p>All the exercises are made in Octave, a free version of Matlab of sorts, and you finish the course implementing your own Neural Network!</p><p>The syntax in Octave is easy to grasp for any programmer, so don’t let that be a barrier for you.</p><p>Once you finish the course, you will have implemented all the major algorithms and will be able to solve several prediction problems.</p><h3>Random Forests</h3><p>I said all the major algorithms, right?</p><p>Actually, there is but one flaw in Andrew Ng’s course, he doesn’t cover Random Forests.</p><p>An awesome complement to his course is fast.ai’s <a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a>.</p><p>Jeremy Howard goes super practical on the missing piece in Ng’s course covering a topic that is, for many classical problems, the best solution out there.</p><p>Fast.ai’s approach is what is called Top-Down, meaning they show you how to solve the problem and then explain why it worked, which is the total opposite of what we are used to in school.</p><p>Jeremy also uses real-world tools and libraries, so you learn by coding in industry-tested solutions.</p><h2>Deep Learning</h2><p>Finally!</p><p>The reason why we are all here, Deep Learning!</p><p>Again, the best resource for it is Professor Ng’s course, actually, a series of courses.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a> is composed of 5 courses total going from the basics and evolving on specific topics such as language, images, and time-series data.</p><p>One nice thing is that he continues from the very end of his classical Machine Learning course, so it just feels like an extension of the first course.</p><p>The math, the concepts, the notion of how and why it works, he delivers it all very concisely like few I’ve seen.</p><p>The only drawback is that he uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> 1.x (Google’s DL Framework) in this course, but that’s minimal detail in my opinion since the explanations and exercises are so well delivered.</p><p>You can pick up the most recent version of the framework relatively easy and to do so there is the final piece of this guide, a book.</p><h3>Too much stuff, give me something faster</h3><p>This book might be the only thing you need to start, it is Aurélien Géron’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a>.</p><p>It covers a lot, from classical Machine Learning to the most recent Deep Learning topics. Good examples and exercises using industry-grade frameworks and libraries.</p><p>I dare say that, if you are really in a rush, you can skip everything I said before and just go for the book.</p><p>You will miss a good amount of information contained on the other resources mentioned, but the practical and actionable knowledge from Géron’s book is enough to work on many ideas for your next project.</p><p>If you feel limited after only reading the book, go back and study the rest of the material, it will fill in the gaps you might have and give you a more solid understanding.</p><h2>What about Framework X or Y?</h2><p>"Hey, I’ve heard about PyTorch and that other framework or library X everybody talks about".</p><p>As a Software Engineer, you know better than anyone how fast technology evolves.</p><p>Don’t go crazy for that, after you learn the basics in this guide, you can easily go, for instance, on <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> documentation or any other library or framework of sorts and learn how to use it in a week or two.</p><p>The techniques, the concepts, are all the same, it is only a matter of syntax and application or even tastes that you might have for any given tool.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To wrap it up, I want to say that, even though it might seem a lot, I tried to remove all the noise and at the end of the process, you will feel confident that you understand what is happening behind the curtains, the jargons and even be able to read some papers published in the field to keep up with the latest advances.</p><p>TL;DR Here is the list of resources mentioned in sequence:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a></li><li><a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p>In 2016, I began saving up for an experiment living as a <a href="https://ozchen.com/quit-digital-nomad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital nomad</a>. It was the first time I had to seriously think about what my “runway” would be. How long would my money last if I were to have no income coming in, and I wanted to continue traveling? </p>



<p>I decided to take a small bets experiment, figuring that 2 months abroad would be a enough to gauge what this digital nomad life is all about.</p>



<p>I calculated my monthly expenses – rent, food, all the big items – and created a “travel fund” worth at least 2 months of expenses. Even if the South American countries I was interested in had a lower cost of living, I wanted a wider margin to account for unexpected expenses like flights, having to get an emergency AirBnB, and shenanigans. </p>



<p>I came back from that trip with a little more money leftover than I had budgeted…and it felt good. </p>



<p>I got my first taste of buying myself future months and I wasn’t going back. </p>



<h3>Conventional financial advice promotes two extremes</h3>



<p>The typical financial advice rest on two points: </p>



<p>On one hand, build an emergency fund. Experts like <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/quick-guide-to-your-emergency-fund">Dave Ramsey</a> suggesting a starter fund of $1000.</p>



<p>On the other hand, think about retirement—which could be hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars. <br></p>



<blockquote><p>Fidelity Investments recommends that “a 40-year old should have a nest egg twice her annual income; by age 50, the egg should be four times income and at age 60, retirement savings should be six times current income.” (<a aria-label="Zacks (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://finance.zacks.com/should-nest-egg-retire-4445.html" target="_blank">Zacks</a>)</p></blockquote>



<p>This super long term outlook is hard to relate to, especially for younger people starting out in the workforce, saddled with student loan debt and without much savings. </p>



<p>There needs to be an aspirational stage, something that feels more within reach between setting up an emergency fund (basic) and planning for retirement (advanced). </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-march-2019/">Bankrate</a>, 21% of Americans don’t save <em>any</em> of their annual income.</p>



<p>On the contrary, “Four in 10 identify themselves as aggressive short-term savers, where they excel at putting money aside for a specific purpose, like a trip or wedding, but aren’t consistently setting aside money for the future.” (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-why-americans-dont-save-even-when-they-know-better-2019-02-25">MarketWatch</a>). </p>



<p>This shows that people are incentivized to save for tangible things.</p>



<p>Taking in those insights, we can apply the psychological trick of chunking: <br><strong>Simplify things by breaking them down I into digestible chunks. </strong></p>



<h3>How the Future Self Savings Method works </h3>



<p>Here’s what I found more motivating: <strong>buy myself one future month at a time.</strong> A rough calculation:</p>



<ol><li>Figure out monthly expenses. (I use the last 12 months’ average)</li><li>Pad that number by 10-20%</li><li>Every time you save that number, you’ve bought your future self a month!</li></ol>



<p>Let’s mull over that last point. </p>



<blockquote><p>Every time you save a month’s worth of expenses, you’ve bought your future self a month of freedom.</p></blockquote>



<div><p>Say that your average living expenses is $3000.</p><p>Because we can’t predict inflation or how the value of the dollar will change, let’s pad that amount by 20%. </p></div>



<p>$3000 x 1.2 = $3600. </p>



<p>Now, every time you save $3600, you just bought your future self another month of worry-free expense.  </p>



<h3>The psychology of earning “financially free” months</h3>



<p>What would it take to <strong>buy yourself a year of freedom? </strong></p>



<p>Using our previous illustration, that’d look like $3000 x 1.2 x 12 = <strong>$43,200</strong>.</p>



<p>For about the cost of a new car, you can buy yourself 1 year of freedom to being a digital nomad, try starting a small business, or explore a career change. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="533" src="https://i1.wp.com/ozchen.com/wp-content/uploads/future-self-savings-method-vacation-fund-calendar-budget.png?resize=960%2C533&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ozchen.com/wp-content/uploads/future-self-savings-method-vacation-fund-calendar-budget.png?w=1355&amp;ssl=1 1355w, https://i1.wp.com/ozchen.com/wp-content/uploads/future-self-savings-method-vacation-fund-calendar-budget.png?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>It’s fun to model out: <em>how fast can I buy myself future months?</em> </p>



<p>Say that someone takes home $6000 a month after taxes, and sets her “future self month expenses” at a generous $3600. If she divide that budget by income, and multiply by 12, she would arrive at the number of months it takes to earn 1 year off. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="946" height="378" src="https://i2.wp.com/ozchen.com/wp-content/uploads/build-freedom-fund-calculation.jpg?resize=946%2C378&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ozchen.com/wp-content/uploads/build-freedom-fund-calculation.jpg?w=946&amp;ssl=1 946w, https://i2.wp.com/ozchen.com/wp-content/uploads/build-freedom-fund-calculation.jpg?resize=768%2C307&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>( Free month number / Take home income ) x 12 = The number of months it takes to earn 1 year off</figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously it can be difficult to save that much money (that’s a 60% savings rate). But this type of illustration can be another guidepost in figuring out personal budgets, salary raises, or just aspirational numbers for increasing income and decreasing expenses. </p>



<p><strong>Imagine that for every month you work, you’ve earned yourself a free future month</strong>. </p>



<p>Now imagine that for every month you work, you’ve earned yourself <strong>two</strong> future months. Whoa!</p>



<p>This idea becomes even more powerful when combined with decreasing expenses and investing your money.</p>



<p>That’s why I think saving for  <strong>financially free months</strong> is a powerful idea. </p>



<h3>Not an emergency fund, but a Freedom fund.</h3>



<p>You might be thinking: “isn’t this just an emergency fund?” </p>



<p>A freedom fund just extends the idea of an emergency fund for aspirational purposes. </p>



<p>If you’re like me and don’t want to live a “deferred life” (nod to Tim Ferriss), then the Future Self Savings Method may be an motivating idea. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p><strong>Deferred life plan: </strong><br>Work your ass off for decades, then enjoy that money when you’re less able to</p><cite>YEAH, NO THANKS</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The Future Self Savings Method has the subtle effect of reorienting my relationship with money:</p>



<blockquote><p>[BEFORE] “How much money do I want to save?” </p><p>[AFTER] “How much <strong>time</strong> do I want to make?” </p></blockquote>



<p>Now, instead deferring my life decades out, I can more confidently plan on the order of months and years.</p>



<p><strong>How much much freedom do you want to have saved?</strong></p>



<hr>



<p><em>Afterwords</em></p>



<p>I haven’t studied the FIRE (financially independent, retire early) movement that closely. Maybe this is just the same thing. </p>



<p>This article may feel the most relatable to those making $75k and beyond. But I think the Future Self Savings Method is still a lot more actionable than “I want to be rich / a millionaire someday” </p>



<p>This reorients my relationship with money from “How much money do I want to save?” to “How much free time do I want in the future?” </p>



<p>Saving for a rainy day and setting yourself up with a safety net <em>is</em> crucial, especially when you consider that nearly <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nearly-half-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck-bank-survey">half of Americans live paycheck to paycheck</a>, and more than half do not have an emergency fund that can cover 3 months of expenses. That became devastatingly clear when Covid hit and the government starting sending out $1200 checks. </p>



<p>But psychologically, an emergency fund is not that motivating. Backup plans are important, but doesn’t create aliveness.</p>

<li>2020-10-25 Comment by Erik</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>

If you're, for example, contributing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">reddit</a> thread about something which is irrelevant or anything with only a short-term relevance, this article does not apply to you right now.

</p>

<p>

However, as soon as you're helping somebody solving an interesting issue, summarize your experiences with something or write anything that might be cool to be around in a couple of years as well, you do provide potential high-value content. My message to all those authors is: <b>don't use web-based forums</b>.

</p>

<p>

TL;DR: all of the content of closed, centralized services will be lost in the long run. Choose the platform you contribute to wisely now instead of learning through more large data loss events later-on.

</p>

<p>

The longer version is worth your time:

</p>

	  <header><h2>What Do I Mean With Web-Based Forums Here?</h2></header>

<p>

In this article, I'm using the term "web-based forums" as an umbrella term for closed, centralized services like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, Facebook, or any other web-based forum where you are able to add comments, articles, and so forth in most cases only after creating an account.

</p>

<p>

Typically, those services don't provide any possibility to extract or synchronize content. They don't offer open APIs that allow users to choose among different and open user interfaces. They are owned and operated by private companies.

</p>

<p>

Please note that when I'm going to mention more or less only reddit as an example in the next sections, this is because reddit is the only web-based forum <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/publicvoit">I'm familiar with</a> to a certain level. This does not mean that reddit is worse than other closed, centralized web-based forums. Not at all.

</p>

	  <header><h2>So What's the Issue With Web-Based Forums?</h2></header>

<p>

There is not one issue. There are several things where web-based forums don't qualify for being a platform for quality content. Let's take a look at some of them.

</p>

<p>

I'm glad you're still reading this article and I hope you bear with me until the end of it. Most people will realize and learn about having contributed lots and lots of high-value information only when platforms are down for good. And this is what makes me really sad. It is just like you know that one building of the Library of Alexandria is going to burn down in a few years and people still bring many unique copies of high-quality books into its shelves, unaware of destroying knowledge this way.

</p>

	  <header><h3>Issue: No Backup, No Distribution</h3></header>

<p>

For reasons and examples stated <a href="https://karl-voit.at/cloud">in this article</a>, any centralized web-based service will go offline some day. Some sooner, some later. Popularity is not even a guarantee that a service gets continued, as you can see with <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">hundreds of (partly) very well known and used Google services that were shut down</a>. Nothing will be on the web forever. Most people are not aware of this fact. The books set on this machine are more likely to survive history than all of your reddit/Facebook/... contributions:

</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://karl-voit.at/2020/10/23/avoid-web-forums/2019-10-05T22.56.47%20Buchdruckmuseum%20-%20Linotype%20-%20Tastatur%20--%20cliparts%20typography%20history%20publicvoit%20-%20scaled%20width%20630.jpg" alt="" width="630">
<figcaption>A Linotype machine.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>

So when you begin to be aware of this fact, you might want to think of things you can do to mitigate data loss when services are discontinued or "sunrized" as some marketing experts say.

</p>

<p>

You could, for example, back-up the data of this service. By providing the information on multiple servers, chances are high that not all of them are lost at the same time.

</p>

<p>

This requires certain properties. For example, you need to be able to duplicate the service on multiple servers. To be able to do so, you'll need not only the data but also the software that is providing access to the service. When different organization are running mirrored servers, it is required to openly share the data and software. This can be ensured by using Open Source software or at least open APIs and a business model that does not rely on keeping data and technical things a secret.

</p>

<p>

All major commercial services such as reddit, Facebook and so forth keep everything a secret that is not ultimately necessary to use their services. Their software is a secret, they don't offer open APIs or only very crippled ones, you don't have the possibility to get to the raw data. So no luck there. You do have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">a lock-in situation</a>.

</p>

<img src="https://karl-voit.at/2020/10/23/avoid-web-forums/2020-10-23%20Oatmeal_-_reaching_people_on_the_internet%20--%20publicvoit%20-%20scaled%20width%20630.png" alt="" width="630">
<figcaption>https://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>

Even with personal blogs, "fragile" as they are, you are able to use the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine of the Internet Archive</a> to back up your blog. For example, every page on my blog contains a link to its archive in the page footer. This ensures that you can not only browse the latest version of all of my blog articles in case of a server breakdown. This also enables you to browse all previous version, probably changed over time. Go ahead, try a few "Archive" links of my articles. If any of my articles start with an "Updates:" section, you know for sure that there are older versions accessible via the Internet Archive.

</p>

<p>

The Wayback Machine does not archive reddit threads. It can not properly back up Facebook pages. <a href="https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360004651732-Using-The-Wayback-Machine">It's blinded by corporate secrecy</a> when it comes to archive content for the upcoming generations:

</p>

<blockquote>Why isn't the site I'm looking for in the archive?<br>
Some sites may not be included because the automated crawlers were
unaware of their existence at the time of the crawl. It's also
possible that some sites were not archived because they were password
protected, blocked by robots.txt, or otherwise inaccessible to our
automated systems. Site owners might have also requested that their
sites be excluded from the Wayback Machine.</blockquote>

<p>

Summarizing the things mentioned above: without very good support for data export, service duplication, open standards, any content you provide in closed web-based services will be lost just as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/business/myspace-user-data.html">MySpace already lost twelve years of content just so</a>, just to mention one big example.

</p>

	  <header><h3>Issue: User Interface Dictatorship</h3></header>

<p>

When you grew up only knowing centralized web-based forums, you can not imagine the many advantages of having the freedom to choose your preferred user interface. While some people might think this is a minor issue, let me explain a few examples where this makes a huge difference.

</p>

<p>

The first example starts with something that might only annoy people. With comments like on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hfamm7/those_who_have_tried_out_multiple_zettelkasten/fvx9vu5/">this thread</a>, you clutter up other people's interface for personal gain. It's selfish and distracts from the information consumption.

</p>

<p>

The reason why people are using such reminder bots is multi-fold. First, they don't use a proper todo management system that would be able to remind them to read a certain article in a few days. They externalize this inability to the web-based forum and all of its other users. <a href="https://karl-voit.at/tags/pim">I'm working on fixing these educational issues</a>. Secondly, there is no way to have features that you can use that do not affect other people's interface.

</p>

<p>

Consider people with visual impairment do have special needs. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6ncgvjt">The WHO reports</a> an estimate of 285 million people that do are visually impaired, ninety percent of them living in developing countries. Those are not numbers you can simply ignore. It is obvious that they do need different kind of interfaces. Either they have to use a high-contrast interface, highly unusual interface scaling factors, an interface that avoids certain color combinations, text-to-speech systems or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille#Braille_reading">Braille readers</a> that are able to extract the content properly.

</p>

<p>

If a web-based services that - remember from before - does not offer proper open APIs and which does not implement said features, all those people simply can not participate and you can not profit from their knowledge and experience.

</p>

<p>

And even when you think that this is just a minority I can provide examples where everybody profits from choosing his or her own interface.

</p>

<p>

Some services are providing interfaces that aren't working properly on small displays or mobile devices in general. In these cases, without any ability to switch to an alternative app or web-page, you are locked out even with perfect eyesight.

</p>

<p>

When you're using an web-based forum that does not provide the feature that already read articles are marked or collapsed, you need to skim though a thread completely and re-read content to find out new postings when re-visiting the thread after a while. Our time should not spent on senseless tasks like this.

</p>

<p>

Alternative interfaces might provide advanced rating features based on your personal taste and choice so that you are able to filter out the most relevant articles easily and do not clutter your view with irrelevant articles at all. This is also called "scoring". It can be based on keywords, the amount of personal contributions to a longer thread, friendship relationships from your contact management, and so forth.

</p>

<p>

Some people prefer navigating using the keyboard. Either by personal taste or by physical restrictions. If the web-based centralized service only supports mouse-based navigation, you can not use this service.

</p>

<p>

I could continue with examples like that. The common theme is: when one particular centralized web-based forum is not implementing all of those nice features you need or like, you can not use them properly.

</p>

	  <header><h3>Issue: Rule Monopoly and Subjective Censorship</h3></header>

<p>

When you do live in a society with certain set of (legal) rules, providers of relevant web-based forums have to follow and enforce some of them. However, the issue is that this kind of censorship is and will always be related to a particular culture and society at a specific time.

</p>

<p>

For example, in Germany and Austria, being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">Nazi</a> is punishable by law. In the USA, freedom-loving people think fans of the human monsters that tortured and murdered millions of Jews in the Second World War need the possibility to express their personal "opinion". As you can see, there is a different point of view in-between the lines when I write about Nazis compared to an author from the USA who values "freedom of speech" higher than "being a die-hard fan of mass murders". It's a very difficult topic you can not enforce with a world-wide service.

<![CDATA[A12 – Advancing Network Transparency on the Desktop]]>

October 29, 2020 | https://arcan-fe.com/2020/10/28/a12-advancing-network-transparency-on-the-desktop/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arcan-fe.com/2020/10/28/a12-advancing-network-transparency-on-the-desktop/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>This article is is the main course to the appetiser that was <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/11/16/the-x-network-transparency-myth/">The X Network Transparency Myth</a> (2018). In it, we will go through how the pieces in the Arcan ecosystem tie together to advance the idea of network transparency for the desktop and how it sets the stage for a fully networked desktop.</p>



<p>Some of the points worth recalling from the X article are:</p>



<ol><li>‘transparency’ is evaluated from the perspective of the user; it is not even desirable for the underlying layers to be written so that they operate the same for local rendering as they would across a network. The local-optimal case is necessarily different from the remote one, the mechanisms are not the same and the differences will keep on growing organically with the advancement of hardware and display/rendering techniques.</li><li>side-band protocols splitting up the desktop into multiple IPC systems for audio, meta, fonts, … increases the difficulty to succeed with anything close to a transparent experience, as the network layer needs to take all of these into consideration as well as trying to synchronise them.</li></ol>



<p>To add a little to the first argument: it should also not be transparent to the window manager as some actions have drastically different impact on the user interface side to security and expectations. For example, Clipboard/DND locally is not (supposed to be) a complicated thing. When applied across a network, however, such things can degrade the experience for anything else. Other examples is that you want to block some sensitive inputs from being accidentally forwarded to a networked window and so on, it has happened in the past that the wrong sudo password has, indeed, been sent to the wrong ssh session.</p>



<p>This target has been worked on for a long time, as suggested by this part from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O40cPUqLb">old demo</a> from 2012/2013. Already back then the drag/slice to compose-transform-and-share case exposed out of compositor sharing and streaming; something that only now is appearing elsewhere in a comparably limited form.</p>



<p>We are on the third or fourth re-implementation of the idea, and the first one that is considered having a good enough of a design to commit to using and building upon. There are many fascinating nuances to this problem that only appear when you ‘try to go to 11’.</p>



<p>As per usual, parts of this post will be quite verbose and technical. Here are some shortcuts to jump around so that you don’t lose interest from details that seem irrelevant to you.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demos</h2>



<p>Starting with some short clips of the development progress – and then work through the tools and design needed to make this happen. It might be short, but there is a whole world of nuance and detail to it.</p>



<p>(~early 2019) – forced compression, OSX viewer, (bad) audio:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Composited Xarcan (desktop to pinephone), compression based on window type:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here is a native arcan client with crypto, local GPU “hot-unplug” to software rendering handover and compression negotiation (h264):</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RSvk7mmiSE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Here is ‘server-side’ text rendering of text-only windows, font, style and size controlled by presenting device — client migrates back when window is closed:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>In the videos, you can see (if you squint) instances of </span><em>live migration</em><span> between display servers over a network, with a few twists. For example, the decorations, input mapping, font preferences and other visuals change to match the machine that the client is currently </span><em>presenting</em><span> on and that audio also comes along, because </span><a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/10/05/awk-for-realtime-multimedia/">Arcan does multimedia</a><span>, not only video. </span></p>



<p><span>What is less visible is that the change in border colour, a security feature in </span><a href="http://durden.arcan-fe.com/">Durden</a><span>, is used to signify that the window comes from a networked source, a property that can also be used to filter sensitive actions. The neo-vim window in the video even goes so far as to have its text surfaces rendered server side, as its </span><a href="https://github.com/letoram/nvim-arcan">UI driver</a><span> is written using our terminal-protocol liberated </span><a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/wiki/TUI">TUI API.</a> This is also why the font changes; it is the device you&nbsp;<em>present</em> on that defines visuals and input response, not the device you run the program on.</p>



<p>Also note how the clients “jumps” back when the window is closed on the remote side; this is one of the many payoffs from having a systemic mindset when it comes to&nbsp; ‘<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/">crash resilience</a>‘ – the IPC system itself is designed in such a way that <em>necessary</em> state can b<span>e reconstructed and&nbsp;</span><em>dynamic</em><span>&nbsp;state is tracked and renegotiated when needed. The effect is that a client is forcefully detached from the current display server with the instruction of switching to another.</span> The keystore (while a work in progress) allows you to define the conditions for when and how it jumps to which machines and picks keys accordingly.</p>



<p>That dynamic state is tracked and can be renegotiated as a ‘reset’ matters on the client level as well, the basic set of guaranteed features when a client opens a local connection roughly generalises between all imaginable window management styles. Those that are dynamically (re-) negotiated cannot be relied upon. So when a client is migrated to a user that has say, accessibility needs, or is in a <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/03/29/safespaces-an-open-source-vr-desktop/">VR environment</a>, the appropriate extras gets added when the client connects there, and then removed when it moves somewhere else. This is an essential primitive for network transparency as a collaboration feature.</p>



<h2 id="primitives">Basic Primitives: Arcan-net, SHMIF and A12</h2>



<p>There are three building blocks in play here, a tool called <em>arcan-net&nbsp;</em>which combines the two others:&nbsp;<em>A12</em> and <a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/wiki/SHMIF">SHMIF</a>.</p>



<p>A12 is a <span>‘work in progress’ protocol – it’s not </span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/X12/">X12</a><span> that some people called for, but it’s “</span><em>a”</em><span> twelve. It strives to be remote optimal – compression tactics based on connectivity, content type and context of use, deferred (presentation side) rendering with data-native representation when possible (pixel buffers as a last resort, not the default); support caching of common states such as fonts; handle cancellation of normally ‘atomic’ operations such as clipboard cut and paste and so on.</span></p>



<p>SHMIF is the IPC system and API used to work with most other parts of Arcan. It is designed to be locally optimal: shared memory and system ABI in lock free ring-buffers preferred over socket/pipe pack/unpack transfers; minimal sustained set of system calls needed (for least-privilege sandboxing); resource allocations on a strict regimen (DoS prevention and exploit mitigation); fixed based set of necessary capabilities and user-controlled opt-in for higher level ones.</p>



<p><span>SHMIF has a large number of features that were specifically picked for correcting the wrongs done to X- like network transparency by the gradual introduction of side-bands and good old fashioned negligence. Part of this is that <em>all necessary and sufficient data exchange</em> used to compose a desktop goes over <em>the same</em> IPC system — one that is free of unnecessary Linuxisms to boot. While it would hurt a bit and take some effort, there are few stops for packing our bags and going someplace else, heck it used to run on Windows and still works on OSX. Rumour has it there are iOS and Android versions hidden away somewhere.</span></p>



<p><span>Contrast this with other setups where you need a large weave of IPC systems to get the same job done; Wayland for video and some input and some metadata; PulseAudio for audio; PipeWire for some video and some audio; D-Bus for some metadata and controls; D-Conf for some other metadata; Spice/RFB(VNC)/RDP for composited desktop sharing; Waypipe for partial Wayland sharing, X11 for partial X / XWayland sharing: SSH+VT***+Terminal emulator for CLI/TUI and less unsafe Waypipe / X11 transport; Synergy for mouse and keyboard and clipboard and so on. Each of these with their own take (or lack thereof) on authentication and synchronization, implementing many of the most difficult tasks again and again in incompatible ways yet still end up with features missing and exponentially more lines of code when compared to the solution here.</span></p>



<p>Back to Arcan-net. It exposes an a12 server and an a12 client, as well as acting as a shmif server, a shmif client and taking care of managing authentication keys. In that sense it behaves like any old network proxy. While not going too far into the practical details, showing off some of the setup might help.</p>



<p>On the active display server side:</p>



<pre>void@123.213.132.1# arcan-net -l 31337</pre>



<p>This will listen for incoming connections on the marked port, and map them to the currently active local connection point. <span>To dive further into the connection point concept, either read the comparison between </span><a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/10/17/arcan-versus-xorg-approaching-feature-parity/">Arcan vs Xorg</a><span> or simply think ‘Desktop UI address’; The WM exports named connection points and assigns different policies based on that.</span></p>



<p><span>On the client side we can have the complex-persistent option that forwards new clients as they come:</span></p>



<pre><em>arcan-net</em> -s <em>netdemo</em> <em>123.213.132.1 31337</em><br>ARCAN_CONNPATH=netdemo one_arcan_client &amp;<br>ARCAN_CONNPATH=netdemo another_arcan_client &amp;</pre>



<p>Or the one-time simpler version which forks/exec arcan-net and inherits the connection primitive needed to setup a SHMIF connection:</p>



<pre>ARCAN_CONNPATH=a12://keyid@host:port one_arcan_client</pre>



<p>Or, and this is important for understanding the demo, an api function through the WM:</p>



<pre>target_devicehint(client_vid,"a12://keyid@", true)</pre>



<p>This triggers the SHMIF implementation tied to the window of a client to disconnect from the current display server connection, connect to a remote one through arcan-net, then tell the application part of the client to rebuild essential state as the previous connection has, in a sense, ‘crashed’. The same mechanism is then used to define a fallback (‘should the connection be lost, go here instead’). This is the <em>self-healing</em> aspect of proper <em>resilience</em>.</p>



<p>There are WM APIs for all the possible network sharing scenarios so it can be handled as user interfaces without any command line work.</p>



<p>I mentioned ‘authentication’ before, where is that happening? So this is another part of the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ba050bc6dcf9223f8459"><div><p>A while ago, I was talking to a founder of a startup. We were talking about his experience before and after finding product/market fit.</p><p>I asked him if he could boil down his experience into 1 piece of important advice I could share with The Younglings. He did.</p><p>But it was the way he said it, rather than what he said, that stuck with me.</p><p><em>His answer, because I don’t wanna leave you hanging, was that ‘you will overbuild and it will be a mistake’.</em></p><p>The way he said it was: ‘It is impossible to follow this advice but…’</p><p>That made me think of the advice I could give that I know is impossible to take yet true. The result of that is the essay you’re reading right now.</p><p><em>The irony that this essay is a list is not lost on me. My hatred for superficial business insider listicles has become a running joke. That said, I think this will be a worthwhile exception.</em></p><p>Let’s get right into it.</p><p>If you’re extremely ambitious, the prospect of the ‘disruptive innovation’ of an industry can seem daunting. Where do you even start?</p><p>I am not a big fan of TAM at all. VC’s (and other investors) are biased. They’ll give you self-serving advice. They want you to think big.</p><p><em>More on TAM in: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/tam" target="_blank"><em>Should You Worry About TAM And SAM?</em></a></p><p>Why? Because they don’t care about you as an individual. You’re fungible. As long as of the 100 investments they make, a few become unicorns, that’s perfectly fine!&nbsp;</p><p>While I do think there’s a good case to be made for thinking big and solving the hardest problems on the planet, it’s actually incredibly rare for a founder to start there.</p><p>Take Elon Musk, for example. Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, etc. All incredibly ambitious.</p><p>But his first company? A videogame when he was in his early teens. His first startup? A precursor to Google maps.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s all much more doable.</p><p>He even said in an interview that he probably wouldn’t have been able to start with SpaceX and that he advises against starting with a company that is that capital intensive.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I’ve been unable to find the source. I’ll continue to search for the video on YouTube and I’ll add it to the references if I find it.</em></p><p>In fact, I don’t know of a single founder that started their company with this huge vision. What usually happens is lying. Founders (or PR) will whitewash their history ex-post facto.</p><p>Something that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-lying-about-facebook/?europe=true" target="_blank">Zuckerburg was recently called out</a> for.</p><p>The Collinson brothers have often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DUQ7_7Pj_c" target="_blank">pointed out that had they known Stripe would’ve been this hard, they might not have started it at all</a>.</p><p>So to come back to my question in the first paragraph, where do you even start?</p><p>With 1 person. You!&nbsp;</p><p>Think about a problem you have. Or think about something that you really want to see in the world.</p><p>Then try to see if there are other people like you.&nbsp;</p><p>Forget about scale. Forget about world domination. Forget about Fortune lists.&nbsp;</p><p>Focus on your tiny audience and just build something that improves their lives. According to them, not according to you.&nbsp;</p><p>Get to a point where they love it. Get to a point where they would be deeply sad if your solution went away.</p><p><em>More on architecting user love in: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove" target="_blank"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a></p><p><em>In case you’re suffering from a restless, intellectual brain that just can’t stop asking: ‘But how do I scale?’, the answer is: ‘Keep finding more people’. How much you make people’s lives better (on the X-axis) multiplied by a lot of people (on the Y-axis), is what’ll create a large business.</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592418092968_20301"><div><p><em>Avoid the red bar, and start with the bright blue bar. Even if your company is already creating revenue, you might not have that bright blue bar… a small set of raving fans that absolutely love your product. Then grow that bright blue bar along the Y-axis. In theory, you could also grow the red bar along the X-axis to get the same surface area. In practice that never works out.</em></p><p>There are a small number of ‘non-obvious, capital intensive startups’ (to borrow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya" target="_blank">Chamath</a>’s lexicon).&nbsp;</p><p>In those cases, you probably can’t be profitable from the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Unless you’re very creative and have a long time horizon. For example, one might have been able to start Tesla by starting Boosted Boards, then launching into new categories until you eventually get to cars. Dyson did a similar thing from vacuums to hand dryers to fans to blow dryers to cars. </em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50004184" target="_blank"><em>Unfortunately, they’ve announced they’re pulling out</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>But I believe most small businesses and startups should be profitable from the beginning and scale or hover just below profitability.</p><p>It’s a mistake to solely focus on growth in hopes of one day pulling the magical profitability lever and suddenly being profitable.</p><p>Hope makes for a poor business strategy and the reason you hear about Google is that it’s so rare. More often than not it just doesn’t work out. [1]</p><p>If you do decide to put growth over profitability, you should know your numbers and be clearly able to articulate why it’s a good idea.</p><p>I’d rather see a Lambda School than a Homejoy.</p><p><em>Austen raised after being profitable (= knowing his LTV, CAC, churn etc.) in order to fund faster growth and compress the timeline. Adora raised while not knowing exactly what LTV and CAC would end up being. Although there are always many factors, the biggest one was that acquiring customers was too expensive and they had poor retention. This obviously doesn’t mean Austen is better than Adora. Adora is a legend and she added many leaves to the tree of entrepreneurial science. It just means that Adora took a more risky approach and that has a smaller chance of working out.</em></p><p>You know who obsessively focuses on the competition? People that have run out of ideas.</p><p>If you:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Have a clear grasp of what fucking sucks in this world.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A good solution for fixing it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>And, a group of people that love your product,</p></li></ol><p>then that’ll take up all of your time.</p><p>Obviously, the competition sucks otherwise the problem or the need wouldn't exist. They would’ve solved it. [2]</p><p>Correctly identifying a real problem, or a need that a certain audience has as well, and then building a solution that they love, is already hard enough.</p><p>Trying to simultaneously focus on what the competition is doing (or even worse, might do) is near impossible. [3]</p><p>If you're doing your job correctly, you’ll hear what the competition is up to anyway. But if that heavily affects your decision-making process, you’re doing it wrong.</p><p><em>1 important exception to this is if your company relies mainly on psychological innovation. Oatly struggled even though they had a great product. It wasn’t until </em><a href="https://thechallengerproject.com/blog/2016/oatly" target="_blank"><em>they brought in a guy with the necessary expertise in psychological innovation</em></a><em> (John Schoolcraft) that they were able to scale. He realized that they were mimicking the competition and by looking at what they were doing, he could make sure Oatly steered clear of that and develop its own voice.</em></p><p><em>More on psychological innovation in this essay series: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/illogical" target="_blank"><em>Why Your Business Needs More Weird Ideas</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Young companies don’t get killed by big companies. They fail to follow point 1 on this list. They make something mediocre, or they solve a problem that doesn’t exist, or they build something to address a need that no one has.</p><p>When Jack Dorsey built Twitter, he wasn’t solving a problem. He was addressing a need… his own. It’s possible that in an alternate but nearly identical universe, he is an outlier and people just aren’t that into Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>But as it so happens, his colleagues at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">Odeo</a> loved it and it started to spread.</p><p>Keep iterating your business model canvas, or pivot, until you've succeeded in making a product that makes people bang down your door to get it. [4]</p><p>To quote Andy Rachleff (created modern product/market fit theory inspired by Don Valentine):</p><blockquote><p>‘[…]if you’re really good at execution but the dogs don’t want to eat the dog food, you have no chance of winning.’</p></blockquote><p>I thought it would be nice to end this list on the advice that kicked it off.</p><p>Get your idea into the hands of users as quickly as humanly possible. Your brain is lying to you when it tells you that the first impression should be polished and amazing and that Reid Hoffman is wrong when he says:</p><blockquote><p>‘If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late!’</p></blockquote><p>Remember that your brain is wrong in this case. It’s your friend, but like an overprotective mom, it doesn’t want you to get hurt. So it’ll try to trick you (successfully I might add) that you should do anything except the things that actually matter.</p><p>This is the core insight of Noah Kagan’s eminent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwbtSPQ8jAY" target="_blank">Validation Theory</a>.</p><p>The reason why you shouldn’t overbuild is because you’re making a lot of assumptions, and nearly all of those assumptions are wrong.</p><p>The quicker you’re able to identify which ones are wrong the better because it’ll save resources.</p><p>Imagine spending 6 years and $500K engineering a $3500 robot that walks dogs and picks up dog poop. When you try to sell it you learn ‘ain’t nobody wanna spend $3.5K on your dog walking pooper scooper’. You could’ve avoided this by presenting a few people with your idea and ask them to prepay. When you inevitably hear: ‘yeah… uhm, that’s gonna be a hard pass for me chief!’, then you can iterate to something that would be <strong>excited</strong> to pay for.</p><p>Don’t feel bad about ignoring the advice on this list. While everything is true, your brain will find some excuse and you will buy into it. We all do, myself included.</p><p>This seems to be like parents warning you about a bad girl/boy when you’re a teenager. You just need to experience it before it sinks in.</p><p>Then why did I write this essay?</p><p>Because part of me hopes there are a few competitive people that’ll be like: ‘Don’t tell me what I can’t do!’</p><p>And for the rest of the people reading this, when you make these mistakes, I hope you’re able to recognize that you’re making them sooner and are able to course-correct faster.</p><p><em>[1] Again, be mindful of who gives you this advice. VC’s most likely. For them, it’s a win/win situation. If they give you an A round and push you to grow hard, your paper valuation will increase, they can use that to raise more capital. That means they’ll make more money because of their management fee.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>T…</em></p></div></div></div>

the risk of potential use by unauthorized parties or, in the case of a data breach, by malicious actors."</p>  <h2>Company&nbsp;says technology couldn't identify people</h2>  <p>The company said the

    <div>
        <p>In Europe alone, hundreds of different variants of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are currently circulating, distinguished by mutations in their genomes. However, only very few of these variants have spread as successfully and become as prevalent as the newly identified variant, named <em>20A.EU1</em>.</p>

<p>The researchers at the University of Basel, ETH Zürich in Basel and the SeqCOVID-Spain consortium analyzed and compared virus genome sequences collected from Covid-19 patients all across Europe to trace the evolution and spread of the pathogen (see box). Their analysis suggests that the variant originated in Spain during the summer. The earliest evidence of the new variant is linked to a super-spreading event among agricultural workers in the north-east of Spain. The variant moved into the local population, expanding quickly across the country, and now accounts for almost 80% of the sequences from Spain.</p>

<p>“It is important to note that there is currently no evidence the new variant’s spread is due to a mutation that increases transmission or impacts clinical outcome,” stresses Dr. Emma Hodcroft of the University of Basel, lead author of the study. The researchers believe that the variant’s expansion was facilitated by loosening travel restrictions and social distancing measures in summer.</p>

<h4><strong>Similar pattern as in spring in Spain</strong></h4>

<p>“We see a similar pattern with this variant in Spain as we did in the spring,” advises Professor Iñaki Comas, co-author on the paper and head of the SeqCOVID-Spain consortium. “One variant, aided by an initial super-spreading event, can quickly become prevalent across the country.”</p>

<p>From July, <em>20A.EU1</em> moved with travelers as borders opened across Europe, and has now been identified in twelve European countries. It has also been transmitted from Europe to Hong Kong and New Zealand. While initial introductions of the variant were likely from Spain directly, the variant may then have continued to spread onward from secondary countries.</p>

<p>Currently, <em>20A.EU1</em> accounts for 90% of sequences from the UK, 60% of sequences from Ireland, and between 30 and 40% of sequences in Switzerland and the Netherlands. This makes this variant currently one of the most prevalent in Europe. It has also been identified in France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Norway, and Sweden.</p>

<h4><strong>Travel facilitated the spread</strong></h4>

<p>Genetic analysis indicates that the variant travelled at least dozens and possibly hundreds of times between European countries. “We can see the virus has been introduced multiple times in several countries and many of these introductions have gone on to spread through the population,” says Professor Tanja Stadler of ETH Zürich, one of the study’s principal investigators, “This isn’t a case of one introduction just happening to do well.”</p>

<p>Though the rise in prevalence of <em>20A.EU1</em> corresponds with the increasing number of cases observed in many European countries this autumn, the study’s authors caution against interpreting the new variant as a cause for the rise in cases. “It is not the only variant circulating in recent weeks and months,” says Professor Richard Neher of the University of Basel, one of the study’s principal investigators. “Indeed, in some countries with significant increases in Covid-19 cases, like Belgium and France, other variants are prevalent.”</p>

<p>Analysis of the summertime SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in Spain and travel data show that these factors may explain how <em>20A.EU1</em> spread so successfully. Spain’s relatively high number of cases and popularity as a holiday destination may have allowed multiple opportunities for introductions, some of which may have grown into larger outbreaks through risky behaviors after returning home.</p>

<p>The study’s authors highlight the importance of evaluating how border controls and travel restrictions worked in containing SARS-CoV-2 transmissions over the summer, and the role travel has played. “Long-term border closures and severe travel restrictions aren’t feasible or desirable,” explains Hodcroft, “but from the spread of <em>20A.EU1</em> it seems clear that the measures in place were often not sufficient to stop onward transmission of introduced variants this summer. When countries have worked hard to get SARS-CoV-2 cases down to low numbers, identifying better ways to ‘open up’ without risking a rise in cases is critical.”</p>

<h4><strong>Assessing the phenotype of the new variant</strong></h4>

<p>The new variant was first identified by Hodcroft during an analysis of Swiss sequences using the ‘Nextstrain’ platform, developed jointly by the University of Basel and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research center in Seattle, Washington. <em>20A.EU1</em> is characterized by mutations that modify amino-acids in the spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF14 proteins of the virus.</p>

<p>Though the present state of knowledge does not indicate <em>20A.EU1</em>’s spread was due to a change in transmissibility, the authors are currently working with virology labs to examine any potential impact the spike mutation, known as S:A222V, may have on the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ phenotype. They also hope to soon receive access to data that would allow them to assess any clinical implications of the variant.</p>

<p>Also, the study’s authors emphasize the importance of monitoring the rise of new variants like <em>20A.EU1</em> closely: “It is only through sequencing the viral genome that we can identify new SARS-CoV-2 variants when they arise and monitor their spread within and between countries,” adds Neher, “But the number of sequences we have varies widely between countries, and we might be able to identify rising variants sooner with faster and more regular sequencing efforts across Europe.”</p>

    	<p>The ‘Nextstrain’ platform was started in 2015 with the goal of allowing real-time tracking of pathogens via genetic sequencing and hoping to help forecast the future spread of viruses. Nextstrain takes advantage of the small mistakes viruses make when they replicate: The platform creates a ‘family tree’ that shows how different samples are related. This allows scientists to track how viruses spread around the world and through time. Nextstrain has been applied to many pathogens, including those that cause influenza, Zika, Ebola, Tuberculosis, and of course, Covid-19. The Neher lab at the University of Basel currently maintains the Nextstrain analyses of SARS-CoV-2 sequences for most countries in Europe as well as a dedicated analysis for Switzerland.</p>

<p>The SeqCOVID-Spain consortium is aimed to understand the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain and in connection with the rest of the world. It is contributed by more than 30 clinical institutions to get a nationwide representation of the viral diversity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>At Goodcover, our mission is to elevate financial peace of mind with affordable and effective insurance for all. We <a href="https://www.goodcover.com/blog/announcing-goodcover-renters-insurance/">launched</a> earlier this year with our first product, modern renters insurance. Today we’re announcing funding that will accelerate delivering on that mission.</p><p>Our $7.5M Series A financing is led by Goodwater Capital, with participation from Fuel Capital, Broadhaven Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Liquid 2, and TransRe. We’re especially thrilled to collaborate with the team at Goodwater and their dedicated background in consumer technology who’ve helped fund companies such as Monzo, ZeroDown, and Zumper.</p><h2 id="next-step-bring-affordable-renters-insurance-to-more-states">Next Step: bring affordable renters insurance to more states</h2><p>Today, Goodcover’s renters insurance is only available in California. With this funding we will begin to roll out nationally, helping to bring affordable, effective financial peace of mind to as many people as possible. &nbsp;</p><p>Getting Goodcover launched in one state was a huge process (for gory details read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22368112">this HN post</a>), but fortunately that was the heavy lifting. While we plan to eventually be available in all 50 states, launching an insurance offering in each one is a separate process - especially with a novel cooperative model like ours - so we’ll be announcing them as soon we can. &nbsp;</p><p>If you want to be notified when Goodcover starts up in your state, please <a href="http://www.goodcover.com/join">click here</a> to drop in your zip and email to let us know.</p><p>PS - I’ve focused on the fact that we’ll roll out renters in more states, but the truth is our mission demands that we offer more than just renters Insurance. We are working on home and condo as well, and evaluating opportunities in auto and life insurances, so stay tuned.</p><h2 id="member-cooperative-the-fair-model">Member Cooperative: The Fair Model</h2><p>Critical to our success has been our relationship with Goodcover Members - and this starts with our cooperative model that makes insurance fairer and more approachable. As promised when we launched, after a fixed fee we take only what’s needed to cover claims, returning the rest back to members. &nbsp;This is how insurance began - neighbors protecting neighbors - but it is a foreign concept in insurance today. The model works and we’ve proudly returned 1.89% of premium through our <a href="https://www.goodcover.com/blog/2020-member-dividend/">Member Dividend this year</a>. </p><p>Members who don’t want to keep the funds returned to them have the option of contributing them to our Goodpool fund, which is used for good – such as offering <a href="https://www.goodcover.com/blog/free-insurance-for-medical-responders-covid19/">free insurance to medical and other frontline workers fighting COVID-19</a>.</p><h2 id="introducing-the-goodprice-guarantee">Introducing the Goodprice Guarantee</h2><p>It’s also no secret that a large part of Goodcover’s popularity has been the “affordable” part of our mission. On average we are 48% less expensive than legacy providers, but we’ve clocked up to 72% less! We’ve done the work to create efficient, affordable, modern insurance -- we have no middlemen, no agents, no paperwork, no superbowl ads -- we’ve cut out waste with a streamlined digital experience and passed the savings on to members. </p><p>That said, if you have never heard of Goodcover before and are checking us out for the first time, it’s hard to know whether you are getting a good deal, or whether there’s some sort of gotcha. Well, you are, and there isn’t - but it’s our job to prove it to you. &nbsp;We get it, it’s easy to get overwhelmed browsing sales ridden comparison sites that look to complicate a pretty simple thing.</p><p>So, we’re introducing the Goodprice Guarantee. If after joining, you find a better deal somewhere else, simply send us your new policy offer - we’ll refund your Goodcover premium fully. </p><h2 id="hiring-join-us-">Hiring! Join Us.</h2><p>We’ve got a lot to do, so we’re going to need help! Join our all-remote team, we’re looking for: <a href="https://angel.co/company/goodcover-co/jobs/1038060-design-lead">Design Lead</a>, <a href="https://angel.co/company/goodcover-co/jobs/299516-senior-backend-engineer">Senior Backend Engineer</a>, <a href="https://angel.co/company/goodcover-co/jobs/1038024-senior-frontend-engineer">Senior Frontend Engineer</a>, licensed agents to support the Member Experience, Growth Marketers, and everything in between. If you don’t see a specific role open send us a note to <a href="mailto:careers@goodcover.com">careers@goodcover.com</a>.</p><h2 id="get-covered">Get Covered</h2><p>Finally, our continual PSA: if you’ve never had renters insurance there’s no better time to start than today (especially given the tragic wildfires that ravaged the west coast). It starts at $5 a month, you can cancel anytime, it takes only a few minutes (record time is 57 seconds!)... There is no reason not to have it, yet we see so many people who are not protected. Please get it, if not with us, with someone, to protect yourself and your family from unnecessary pain.</p><p>If you’re insured already, send us your policy to <a href="mailto:compare@goodcover.com">compare@goodcover.com</a> and we’ll send you back a detailed coverage comparison showing you how much you can save. If you like what you see, you can join instantly, and we’ll do the work of cancelling and refunding your old policy for you.</p><h2 id="thank-you-members-thank-you-team">Thank you members, thank you team</h2><p>This is a big day for Goodcover - I am so thankful for all the hard work and persistence of the team and everything you have done so far - and I am excited for what we’ll do next.</p><p>And to Goodcover Members - thank you for trusting us with your insurance. We know it’s an act of faith to contribute your real hard earned money in exchange for the promise that we’ll be there when you need us. We’ll make you proud!<br></p><p>Chris Lotz</p><p>CEO and co-founder</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>OTTAWA -- 
	Without customers’ knowledge, more than five million images of Canadian shoppers were collected through facial recognition software used by Cadillac Fairview, a parent company of malls across the country, <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2020/pipeda-2020-004/" target="_blank">according to an investigation by privacy officials.</a></p>
<p>
	The federal privacy commissioner reported Thursday that Cadillac Fairview contravened federal and provincial privacy laws by embedding cameras inside digital information kiosks at 12 shopping malls across Canada, and captured users’ images without their consent.</p>
<p>
	The facial recognition software installed in Cadillac Fairview’s “wayfinding” directories was called “Anonymous Video Analytics (AVA) and through cameras installed behind protective glass, was used in Canadian malls for a brief testing period in 2017 and then was in-use between May and July of 2018.</p>
<p>
	The software took temporary digital images of the faces of any individual within the field of view of the camera inside the directory and converted the images into biometric numerical representations of each face and used that information to compile demographic information about mall visitors.</p>
<p>
	According to the report, the technology was used in directories at the following locations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		CF Market Mall in Alberta</li>
	<li>
		CF Chinook Centre in Alberta</li>
	<li>
		CF Richmond Centre in British Columbia</li>
	<li>
		CF Pacific Centre in British Columbia</li>
	<li>
		CF Polo Park in Manitoba</li>
	<li>
		CF Toronto Eaton Centre in Ontario</li>
	<li>
		CF Sherway Gardens in Ontario</li>
	<li>
		CF Lime Ridge in Ontario</li>
	<li>
		CF Fairview Mall in Ontario</li>
	<li>
		CF Markville Mall in Ontario</li>
	<li>
		CF Galeries d’Anjou in Quebec</li>
	<li>
		CF Carrefour Laval in Quebec</li>
</ul>
<p>
	According to a statement from Privacy Commissioner of Canada Daniel Therrien, the company said the goal of its cameras was to “analyze the age and gender of shoppers and not to identify individuals.”</p>
<p>
	The corporation said that it did not collect personal information because the images were briefly looked at and then deleted, however the information generated from the images was being stored by a third-party contractor called Mappedin, which Cadillac Fairview said it was unaware of.</p>
<p>
	“When asked the purpose for such collection, Mappedin was unable to provide a response, indicating that the person responsible for programming the code no longer worked for the company,” reads the report.</p>
<p>
	Therrien notes in his report that Cadillac Fairview not being aware of Mappedin’s storage of the information “compounded the risk of potential use by unauthorized parties or, in the case of a data breach, by malicious actors.”</p>
<p>
	In an interview on CTV’s Power Play, Deputy Commissioner Brent Homan called it a “massive invasion of privacy” and not one that shoppers would have expected while at the mall. Homan said that one of the lessons Canadians should take away from this report is that facial recognition software is available for companies to use, and while they encourage entities to ask for consent before deploying it on the public, that’s not always the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Cadillac Fairview—one of the largest owners and operators of retail and other properties in North America—“expressly disagreed” with the investigation’s findings, telling the commissioners that there were decals placed on shopping mall entry doors noting their privacy policy.</p>
<p>
	These stickers directed visitors to visit guest services to obtain a copy of the company’s privacy policy, but when the investigators asked a guest services employee at the Eaton location in Toronto, the employee was “confused by the request” and so Therrien found the stickers to be an “insufficient” measure.</p>
<p>
	“Shoppers had no reason to expect their image was being collected by an inconspicuous camera, or that it would be used, with facial recognition technology, for analysis,” said Therrien in a statement. “The lack of meaningful consent was particularly concerning given the sensitivity of biometric data, which is a unique and permanent characteristic of our body and a key to our identity.”</p>
<p>
	The investigation was launched in 2018, following several media reports about information kiosks in malls being equipped with unmarked cameras to monitor visitor demographics. Their examination in this case included visiting Cadillac Fairview’s Toronto headquarters to interview key personnel, viewing the AVA technology inside the wayfinding directories in action, and extracting records from the directories for forensic analysis.</p>
<p>
	The existence of the software came to light after a user posted an image to Reddit of a display screen at the CF Chinook Centre in Calgary showing coding language including “FaceEncoder” and “FaceAnalyzer.”</p>
<p>
	Commissioner Therrien’s office worked with Alberta Information and Privacy Commissioner Jill Clayton as well as the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia Michael McEvoy on the investigation.</p>
<p>
	“Not only must organizations be clear and up front when customers’ personal information is being collected, they must also have proper controls in place to know what their service providers are doing behind the scenes with that information,” Clayton said in a statement.</p>
<p>
	The trio of commissioners have expressed concern that the company hasn’t accepted their request to commit to ensuring meaningful and express consent is obtained from shoppers in the future should it choose to redeploy similar technology in the future.</p>
<p>
	In a statement provided to CTV News, Cadillac Fairview notes that the issue has been resolved, the data deleted, and the cameras have been deactivated. As well, the facial recognition software is no longer in use, but the company says it will not commit to its approach to “hypothetical future uses of similar technology.”</p>
<p>
	“The five million representations referenced in the OPC report are not faces. These are sequences of numbers the software uses to anonymously categorize the age range and gender of shoppers in the camera’s view,” the company said. “We thank the Privacy Commissioner for the report and recommendations on how to further strengthen our privacy practices and agree that the privacy of our visitors must always be a top priority.”&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><img alt="Pete Garvin" width="100%" src="https://www.tcgarvin.com/images/dad-compressed.jpg"></p><p><em>Tl;dr: I miss my dad.  I <a href="https://github.com/protectus/pfring-to-mongo">published</a> some of the code we wrote together.</em></p><h3>Background</h3><p>The phone call was short.  I asked how he was feeling, and if they had figured out what was going on yet. Dad evaded. They were still getting answers, he said. That was all I needed to hear.  I walked to the nearby park in the Fall air, sat on a bench under a remote tree, and lost my composure.</p><p>Sobbing is a really weird sound, I thought to myself. Gasps and sniffs, heaves, tears, borderline hyperventilation. I was not used to hearing these noises come from me, especially when I had nothing more than my gut to inform my fears.</p><p>But I'd heard it in his voice. Everything was not alright. The world was ending.</p><p>As I grew up, it always seemed a little irrational to me that my deepest terror was losing my dad. At 15 years old, then 20, 25, I never really heard anyone around me talking about how vitally important their dads were to them. And besides, it’s natural that a son lose his father, rather than a father lose his son. Right? And yet, even after the birth of my own sons reoriented my hopes and fears, the only anxiety late at night that could consistently latch onto my mind — and not let go — was how much I couldn’t bear to lose Dad.  Now my literal nightmares materialized.</p><p>Today is the first aniversary of Pete Garvin's death. He died of cancer 4 weeks after his initial diagnosis. The weather report says it will rain all day today from the hurricane. A family friend told me the rain is from him for us, and I believe her.</p><h2>My Motivations, In Brief</h2><p>Before he fell ill, Dad and I would meet one evening a week at his office in Akron and work on little things around his company, <a href="https://www.protectus.com/">Protectus LLC</a>.  I had helped him build the technology side of the company for a couple of years when I got out of school, and the weekly get together was a good way to exercise parts of my brain that my full-time jobs did not.  It wasn’t lost on me how privileged I was to spend so much time literally being paid to hang out with my own father.  When I look at my career so far, I can trace my success to 3 people.  Dad is at the top of that list.</p><p>I want Dad to be here with me.  I want him to look over my shoulder at this stupid website and tell me that he thinks dark mode is harder to read.  I want to find a way to keep a part of him alive with me, just a little longer.</p><p>So, I’m trying to finalize our last project together.</p><h2>The Project</h2><p>Protectus was built around a product called <a href="https://www.protectus.com/sentry/">the Sentry</a>.  At its core, the Sentry is a combination network sensor and analytics engine.  It reads bytes off the wire, does some deep (and shallow) packet inspection, and dumps information into a local MongoDB database for post-hoc analysis.  Then there’s a web app that facilitates queries and reports.  I wrote the frontend right out of school, and Dad took responsibility for the ingest script.  We designed everything together, spent untold hours in front of the whiteboard diagramming, discussing, and deciding.</p><p><img alt="Dad's whiteboard" width="100%" src="https://www.tcgarvin.com/images/whiteboard-compressed.jpg"><em><small>This is the last whiteboarding Dad and I did.  Notice the contributions for/by my son in the corner.  I can't bring myself to erase any of it.</small></em></p><p>Neither of us were rockstar developers.  Dad’s coding style was informed by C code from the 80s and 90s, with lots of illegible variable names and clever routines that didn't always explain what they were doing.  My code architecture was overly clever and immature, abusing inheritance trees and creating all sorts of extranious abstractions that probably have not aged well.</p><p>We did do some things right, and shipped new Sentry devices to all our existing customers with a year or two of my coming on board.</p><p>The Sentry was not a big commercial success.  I left the company for IBM, and Dad eventually decided to shift cleanly from a product + services company to just a services company.  The Sentry stopped being the main event for the company, and began to be spoken of as just a tool in the toolbox.</p><p>Part of the shift in the Sentry strategy was to open source core parts of the product.  We started with the ingest scripts.  This involved cleaning up the code a bit, and doing some careful git history surgery.  The idea was to publish not just the code, but ship a `pip install`-able module on PyPi.</p><p>I’ve given up on shipping an installable Python module.  PF_RING dropped their repo for the version of Ubuntu we were using to build on Travis, and I don’t have the time or interest to keep the build running.  But I do want to share the code.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/protectus/pfring-to-mongo">Here's the code.</a></p><p>The code itself is probably not very interesting unless you're into parsing network traffic or aggregating it into Mongo. There are some instructions for getting a dev build running, if you're really keen.  This post isn't really about that.</p><p><img alt="Trafcap Contributors" width="100%" src="https://www.tcgarvin.com/images/trafcap-contributors.jpg"><em><small>Dad and I wrote all the code.  This graph shows a partial history of the ingest code I've released, which was more Dad's than mine.</small></em></p><h2>Seeing Dad in the Code</h2><p>In preparing the code to be released, I spent some time browsing git history and its contents.  At first I was caught off guard by how potent seeing his comments was.  It’s not like he left jokes around or anything, but this this codebase (including a lot that I’m not open sourcing today) has his heart and soul in it.</p><pre><code><span><span># Adding vlan id - PFG - April 2014</span><span>

And not always the most deliberate. (sorry) It is exactly what you would expect from a solo C programmer circa 1990, which is basically what dad was.  He would write a passable algorithm the first time, and then tweaked it with if statements over time, resulting in code that was less and less maintainable.  Even though we were working in Python (which I think he really liked), his code structure was the good old C standby of “throw a bunch of functions into a file”.  The mess of code above started out more copacetically.</p><pre><code><span><span># Adding vlan id - PFG - April 2014</span><span>

Still not beautiful, and you have to know what pkt and doc are, because they’re definitely not self-documenting, but you know, better.</p><p>And the stuff really worked. Dad understood better than most the value of simplicity in software architecture.  Even though our system was spread across several processes, and each process might interact directly with the database, (a pattern that elicits shrieks of rage from most software designers I know,) every interaction was well documented and the documentation strictly updated.  The flow of data was one-directional, and the state space was kept under tight control.  We were careful not to introduce too many dependencies.  The only frameworks we used were Debian Packaging, Pyramid, and BackboneJS.  Everything else was a library.  Though much of it was handwritten, the documentation was at least as good as any enterprise dev team I’ve encountered since. (Though not as good as most open source projects I’ve seen)</p><p>As we scaled the Sentry onto higher volume networks, Python started to groan a bit under the load.  I ported a bunch of his ingest code to Cython over a few months, and Lo, his “let’s code this like it’s C” approach fit really intuitively with Cython’s “let’s turn this into C” approach.</p><p>You can’t buy the kind of startup experience I got working with Dad.  Every mistake I made, every design decision, I was the one who had to take responsibility with the repercussions, just because we were a two-man shop, and he trusted me.  I haven’t found that kind of learning environment anywhere else.</p><p>Technical things I learned from or with Dad:</p><ul><li>Early on we recognized the value a monorepo could bring, years before anyone used that word</li><li>I hammered together a CI/CD pipeline from batch scripts. We judged Jenkins to be more infrastructure than we needed</li><li>Instead of local environments, we developed remotely on instances of production environments, sidestepping an entire class of deployment issues</li><li>We maintained multiple release channels and used feature flags to let us quickly respond to customers who wanted more now, without endangering customers who were happy with stability</li><li>We managed an entire fleet of machines with only a few hours a month to coordinate software upgrades</li></ul><p><strong>More important yet</strong> was the concept Dad gave me that wearing lots of hats is fun.  If you're from the future, wondering if I'd be a good fit at your company, just know that I will probably not be happy doing only one kind of work.  With Dad, I:</p><ul><li>Slung Code in Python, Cython, JS and Bash</li><li>Administered a Xen VM farm</li><li>Designed a product UI</li><li>Obtained my GPEN certification and performed pen testing against clients (because we were a security company)</li><li>Used my own product to monitor client networks for security incidents</li><li>Solicited customer feedback to improve my product</li><li>Did sales engineering and support</li><li>Designed implemented and shipped a marketing site (yes it's bad, but it's mine)</li><li>Designed and chose chips for a custom form factor Ethernet tap, and worked with the hardware design firm to design and then test their prototypes</li></ul><p><strong>Even more important yet</strong> were the non-work things Dad taught me.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Sometimes, it feels like things happen for a reason.</p>
<p>After a series of unexpected events, I now find myself as Head of Security Research at <a href="https://r2c.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r2c</a>, the company behind the open source static analysis tool <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep</a>, and I couldn’t be more excited about my role, the company, and the future of application security (AppSec).</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to discuss why I’m betting on r2c, and where I think application security is headed.</p>
<h2>An academic wake up call</h2>
<p><em>A Tale as Old as Time: Things are different outside academia</em> </p>
<p>While I was a young, fresh-faced PhD student at the University of California, Davis, my colleagues and I pursued a number of research projects involving static analysis, and I even interned at Fortify, which was an up-and-coming static analysis security testing (SAST) vendor at the time.</p>
<p>I was amazed and enthralled by the power of static analysis to find bugs and improve software security at scale. Thoughts of other advanced topics like symbolic execution, abstract interpretation, and more joyfully danced through my head like a child’s dreams of presents at Christmas.</p>
<p>So when I joined NCC Group as a security consultant, I couldn’t wait to see the tools my colleagues used. After all, these are some of the top security testers in the world, brought in by most of the largest, and biggest name companies to improve the security of their software.</p>
<p>So what secret tools did these legendary security consultants use?</p>
<ol>
<li>Burp Suite</li>
<li>An editor like Emacs, Vim, or VS Code</li>
<li>Aaaand... <code>grep</code> (Pro-tip: use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripgrep</a>, it’s much faster)</li>
</ol>
<p>How could this be? How could such advanced approaches and tools exist and yet so few people use them?</p>
<p>It would take a few years, and off-the-record conversations with security engineers from dozens of companies, but eventually I found some answers.</p>
<h2>Static analysis in the real world™</h2>
<p>As a security consultant performing penetration tests, I quickly saw why we preferred <code>grep</code>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Above all, consultants are <em>time limited</em> - they need to find bugs yesterday, and don’t have time to set up tools, run multi hour scans, and triage hundreds of false positives. Any tool needs to a) be useful out of the box, b) be able to get up and running in minutes, and c) provide real value.</li>
<li>Consultants rarely receive source code in buildable form, which is required by many tools. Again, a consultant <em>could</em> in theory work to build the source code, but that could easily become a time sink that wastes valuable testing time.</li>
<li>Most commercial static analysis tools have licensing models that make consultant use infeasible. Companies may charge by lines of code scanned, number of repos or developers, or some other factor that either doesn’t make sense or is cost prohibitive for lean consulting firms.</li>
<li>Most commercial static analysis tools are hard to customize - if there’s a code-base specific anti-pattern or bug class you’d like to find, writing and validating a custom check might take hours. That is, once you’ve already put in hours or days learning how to write custom rules in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what was keeping <em>companies</em>, with bigger teams and more time and budget, from embracing static analysis?</p>
<h3>Legacy SAST: slow, noisy, and out of touch</h3>
<p>During my final few years at NCC Group, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to moderate DevSecOps focused panels all around the world featuring senior security leaders from companies including Netflix, Dropbox, Apple, Slack, Datadog, Etsy, DocuSign, and more.</p>
<p>And as a security consultant, I led a number of projects around helping companies scale their AppSec programs, embrace automation, and tune and roll out a SAST tool they had purchased.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security teams are tired of tools that deluged them with false positives. They can’t send results directly to developers without damaging their relationships with engineering, but the small AppSec teams don’t have time to triage the results.</li>
<li>
<p>Most SAST tools require onboarding and tuning by a domain expert in order to really provide value. Tuning and writing custom rules, despite being high leverage, tend to be complex tasks and require days or weeks of focused time to become competent.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was willing to put in that time because it was a topic I already had interest and a background in, but for most AppSec teams, they don’t have this in-house expertise and/or there are other more pressing matters-- they can’t dedicate one of their headcount for a few weeks to become proficient in the tool. Thus many SAST installations languish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many SAST buyers (e.g., heads of AppSec or CISOs) <em>didn’t</em> <em>actually expect</em> the tool to provide security value, but rather were buying it to tick a compliance checkbox. This (initially) surprised but saddened me.</li>
<li>Due to the price and complexity of customization, even very advanced, forward thinking AppSec teams were rolling their own static analysis solutions - which were often collections of regexes!</li>
<li>Most importantly, AppSec teams were starting to <strong>view security differently</strong>. More on this below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some anecdotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A mid-sized, rapidly growing startup said they had paid around $150,000 for a popular SAST tool whose output was <em>1 medium severity issue</em> in the past year.</p>
<ul>
<li>I considered asking them to pay me $150K and then I’d manually test until I found 1 medium severity issue and then leave, but unfortunately I did not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In our off-the-record <a href="https://appsecus2018.sched.com/event/GkdM/empowering-modern-development-with-security-automation-trials-and-tribulations-from-the-trenches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppSec USA 2018 panel</a>, my friend Zane Lackey asked the audience, “Who here is happy with their current SAST solution?” In a standing room only conference room with a few hundred people, not a single person raised their hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>A senior sales professional at one of the big vendors came up to Zane afterwards and had some strong opinions on why their product was useful 😅</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>biggest thing</strong> that stuck out to me though, after spending hundreds to thousands of hours in this space, both sounds obvious but is perhaps initially unintuitive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s <strong>impossible</strong> to find every bug, no matter how advanced your tools are. Instead, the <strong>key to scaling security</strong> is to build <strong>secure-by-default libraries</strong> and tools that developers can use to prevent entire classes of vulnerabilities by construction, and then <strong>make sure developers use them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what forward-thinking security teams at companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix, Dropbox, and more believe and have been investing in for <em>years *(see our Global AppSec SF 2020 <a href="https://r2c.dev/global-appsec-sf-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slides</a> for more details and examples</em>)*.</p>
<p>This is not to say that bug finding (manually or with tools) doesn’t have a role, because it does, but rather that it’s not the highest leverage area security teams can invest in.</p>
<h3>A crisis of faith</h3>
<p>At this point I began to question my own goals, personal priorities, and beliefs about security in general - was I really pushing the industry forward, manually finding bugs in different applications?</p>
<p>It was also painful continually seeing companies pay so much for solutions they were unhappy with.</p>
<h2>Enter: r2c</h2>
<p>Naively, I started building my own static analysis tool - something simple and lightweight that fits easily into how modern security teams work. However, I soon found that building and maintaining a production quality tool yourself is A Lot of Work™.</p>
<p>In a random stroke of luck, my friend from grad school, <a href="https://twitter.com/defreez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel DeFreez</a>, told me about this small, SF-based startup called r2c, who were also building a lightweight static analysis tool.</p>
<p>I grabbed lunch with the team and attended a few of their meetups, and was surprised to find how closely our views of the future of security were aligned.</p>
<p>One day I said to Isaac, one of r2c’s co-founders and CEO, “You know, I think you should hire for a role like <code>&lt;this&gt;</code>,” and proceeded to pitch him my dream role, which was an unusual blend of everything: being a pro user of the product and influencing product direction, working closely with marketing to create and share security research that meaningfully pushes the industry forward, and much more.</p>
<p>To my surprise, he chatted with the team, and they ended up agreeing! 😍</p>
<h2>Why I joined r2c</h2>
<p>I joined r2c primarily for two reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>I believed they were on an ideal trajectory for helping shape the future of AppSec, and </li>
<li>I was impressed by the quality of the team and its culture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s get into both in a bit more detail.</p>
<h3>The future of AppSec: killing bug classes via secure defaults</h3>
<p>This topic merits its own post (and maybe blog series), but I wanted to at least touch on it here. For more info, see Isaac and I’s Global AppSec SF 2020 <a href="https://r2c.dev/global-appsec-sf-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slides.</a></p>
<p>Historically, the security industry has focused on vulnerability identification, via pen testing, bug bounty, SAST, DAST, internal testing, and more. However, this is reactive and in general doesn’t prevent future vulnerabilities from being introduced.</p>
<p>However, there have been some promising developments - modern web frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, and others have a number of secure defaults and built-in guardrails that make potentially dangerous tasks safe by default, including context sensitive output encoding (prevent XSS), tight integration with object relational mappers (prevent SQL injection), and more. In my and many others’ opinions, <em>this</em> is why overall web security has improved, not all of the fancy bug finding tools we’ve built.</p>
<p>Forward thinking security teams at companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix, Dropbox, and many others have gone even further than what’s provided out of the box in common frameworks, creating secure libraries for parsing XML, authentication and authorization, mutual TLS between services, secret management, and many more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of AppSec is a one-two punch of secure defaults + lightweight enforcement of those defaults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That way developers can do what they do best: rapidly build scalable, complex software that brings business value to your customers, and not have to constantly be wary of all of the subtle nuances that could lead to a vulnerability.  In an ideal world, <strong>security should be completely transparent to developers</strong>.</p>
<p>By being fast, easily customizable, and open …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>Let’s take react as an example, react is a great frontend library focused on building UI (user interfaces) quickly and efficiently .</p>
<p>To build UI react (and other javascript frontend frameworks) use the components. And here component stands for the building block part for every UI; for example we have a dashboard page with a navbar, sidebar, chart… every part of UI elements is a component moreover the page is one big component includes all other ones and act as a container.</p>

<p>In react to create a component we have two ways :</p>
<ol>
<li>function-based component:  where the component is a function </li>
<li>class-based component: where the component  is a class extending <code>React.Component</code></li>
</ol>
<p>each one has pros and cons (React team is pushing to use functional components in the newest versions)</p>
<p>So what are web components and why we need them if we already have javascript frameworks?</p>
<h2 id="web-component"><a href="#web-component" aria-label="web component permalink"></a>Web Component:</h2>
<p>Web components are a set of <strong>web platform APIs</strong> that allows you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.</p>
<p>In easy words we don’t need javascript framework to create components we can use vanilla javascript to define our custom HTML elements while maintaining the encapsulation and reusability.</p>
<h3 id="web-components-specifications"><a href="#web-components-specifications" aria-label="web components specifications permalink"></a>Web components specifications:</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MDN</a> web components are: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>those set of techos are the specifications to define valid web components :</p>

<div>
<p>Joe Knows Electronics has had a long relationship with Amazon. We started out as an Amazon seller in April of 2010. At that time LEDS were only available on Amazon in a quantity of 1 at a cost of around $1 each + $3.99 shipping. We saw an opportunity to fill a void. We started selling 25 packs of LEDs for $5.99 with free prime shipping.</p>
<p>After finding success in selling LEDs we moved on to provide other parts like resistors and capacitors. We stuck to that original idea of bundling components to maximize value. For resistors, rather than just sell one ohm value we sold 86 together. Most parts that someone might need could be purchased together for a single low price.</p>
<p>At first we sourced pre-made kits from China but quickly learned that people wanted more, both in terms of quality as well as organization. We undertook the task of setting up production to make thousands of kits a month, each containing hundreds of parts. It required hiring people, setting up a factory, and setting up a business process to manage all of it. The end result was the capacitor and resistor kits that became famous.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-300x300.png 300w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-150x150.png 150w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-768x768.png 768w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-600x600.png 600w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-100x100.png 100w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-64x64.png 64w, https://joeknowselectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>
<p>Then growth stagnated for the same reason we were successful. Working within the Amazon system meant producing products that met a certain price, size, and complexity target. If a product was too cheap the Amazon fees would be higher than the cost of the product itself. The shipping costs for a small product shipped under the prime program were the same as shipping a larger product like our resistor kit. If a product was too simple there were 1000 (literally) other sellers undercutting each other to sell that same product. Only products that were too complicated and time consuming for sane people to manufacture, like our resistor kits, could find success and profitability. However, most electronics products don’t have a range of components that make sense as a large kit. There were some attempts to strike out at the fringes of what components people might buy but we never found success like we did in our core capacitor and resistor kits. The magic of Amazon that gave us life was also smothering our ability to grow.</p>
<p>Over the years we continued to produce our handful of core products and we did the job well. Products stayed in stock and quality was consistent. We cut costs where possible and made the process more efficient.</p>
<p>Over the same years Amazon also got greedy. We went from paying 10% commission to 15%. Instead of a fulfillment cost per order plus a low fee on extra units in the same order they started charging the full fulfillment cost on every single unit. On top of that Amazon started listing our products on page 3 of results or worse unless we spent 20-40% of the retail price in advertising. The walls were closing in over the years and there was no clear answer. Amazon makes up the majority of all online e-commerce, our sales were consistent, and it made sense to keep up the status quo rather than erase everything and try again. We made the product to work well with Amazon’s pricing structure and they wouldn’t make as much sense if sold on our own website. We also didn’t have the variety of products to sustain our own website. We made just a few SKUs in massive industrial volume.</p>
<p>In 2019 sales had fallen to the point where we were scaling down production in a major way. It was time for a change so we came up with a plan. It was a radical plan to phase out all of our products and move away from Amazon completely. Rather than sell larger assortments of parts we would sell those same parts as smaller assortments. We would abandon Amazon Prime and create our own prime in a way. Many of these smaller assortments could be purchased together to build your own kit. All of the components would follow a standardized packaging scheme. Components like resistors could be ordered in a smaller range of 12 values or as a complete set like what was available in our older set of 86. This had the following advantages:</p>
<ul><li>Lower cost per component than our existing component kits.</li><li>Easier for customers to reorder commonly used parts without reordering all parts in a kit.</li><li>Mix and match parts like resistors and capacitors to build your own kit rather than buy a bunch of parts not needed for a project.</li><li>Easier for us to produce</li><li>Not reliant on Amazon’s fulfillment</li><li>Able to sell cheaper components as single items rather than as a larger kit containing many items.</li></ul>
<p>It was a great plan. The secret operation to overthrow Amazon was underway. The first products, our resistors, were a couple of months away from being available on our website when the empire (Amazon) struck back. In August we received an email from Amazon stating that our Amazon account had been suspended due to us having more than one Amazon seller account. But of course we don’t. We appealed their decision at least a dozen times but each time they simply state that we need to provide evidence that we don’t have a second account. They had given us an impossible task to prove that we don’t have something. We fell victim to the guilty until proven innocent policy of Amazon. There was no way for us to get in touch with a real person at Amazon. So that’s it. Tens of thousands of orders shipped via Amazon over the years comes to an abrupt end like turning off a light. We were already on our way out the door. Maybe an Amazon AI detected as much and they used an impossible to solve task as an excuse to kick us out.</p>
<p>We were left in an awkward position. The new products weren’t ready yet. The old products had nowhere to be sold. We ended up selling all of our Amazon inventory at cost to another Amazon seller. We rushed to finish production of the new products. Our core product, resistors, are now in stock with the updated packaging. We will be releasing hundreds of new products under a strict monthly schedule.</p>
<p>The apparent moral of this story is that Amazon is evil. But we already all know that. They gave us a great opportunity in the beginning. We’ve now broken free of their chains completely and we’re going to build the best darn electronics supply store the world has ever seen. The vision is clear and the route has been mapped out. We will have the lowest price on a per component basis available from any US based online store.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a bit of pain to push us to where we need to be. That’s true in both business and in life.</p>

October 29, 2020 | https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/introducing-semgrep-and-r2c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/introducing-semgrep-and-r2c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Free, fast, <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source</a>, offline, customizable. These are not often words that describe code scanning tools, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>We founded r2c to bring world-class security tools to developers based on our conviction that software will run the most exciting parts of the future: everything from medical equipment to robots to autonomous cars. The security process should not be the foe but rather the enabler of rapid software development. If developers lack tooling that is easy to set up and understand—or if a developer has to convince their manager to spend a few million dollars on advanced security tools each time they change jobs, the future is bleak.</p>
<p>Before founding r2c, we worked on security and developer tools for large companies and governments. It was eye-opening to see that despite massive budgets, their security programs were generally a generation or more behind the tech giants. When it came to security tools for developers, most teams were jaded about scanning code for vulnerabilities; they hated the tools they had to use and usually ignored them beyond doing the minimum necessary to satisfy a compliance checkbox.</p>
<p>What about code scanning at places like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google? They don't generally use traditional commercial security tools which ask "how can we find every bug?" Instead, they focus on custom tooling that can build guardrails for developers. This doesn't require million-dollar tools, PhDs in program analysis, or days of compute time. It looks much more like unit tests for security.</p>
<p>We believe there is a gap between traditional compliance tools and simple linters that's ripe for a new approach, and we were fortunate to find partners from Redpoint Ventures and Sequoia Capital who agreed. With them, we raised a $13M Series A round of funding to build a security tool that developers might actually love. We've been working on it quietly for a while now, and we're finally ready to announce it to the world!</p>
<h2>Semgrep</h2>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep</a>, our open-source product, is specifically designed for eradicating bug classes.
Developers and security engineers can say "this is the safe pattern we always use for (e.g. parsing XML)", write a rule in a few minutes, and enforce that on every editor save, commit, and pull request.</p>
<p>Semgrep is ideal for building security guardrails: start by using frameworks designed with security in mind, then automatically flag code that strays from the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure-by-default path</a>. This is an approach used by <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/resources/foundationsandprinciples/srs-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/01/designing-security-for-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/continuous-compliance-ase2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, Dropbox, Stripe, <a href="https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/scaling-appsec-at-netflix-6a13d7ab6043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix</a>, and others—a topic <a href="https://events.bizzabo.com/OWASPGlobalAppSec/agenda/session/315858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clint Gibler and I presented on at Global AppSec 2020</a>. This approach increases developer productivity, reduces attack surface, minimizes the areas for human inspection and audit, and allows the security team to scalably protect code written by thousands of developers.</p>
<p>The idea behind Semgrep is simple: it feels like a regular search (grep) but is syntax-aware. You can <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn Semgrep</a> in a few minutes! And Semgrep can be used for <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than just security</a> issues: performance, internationalization, or just annoyances <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/fixing-leaky-logs-how-to-find-a-bug-and-ensure-it-never-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed by accident</a>.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Semgrep started as an open-source project at Facebook and we're lucky to have its original author, Yoann Padioleau, on our team at r2c. Since we released the first post-Facebook version (0.4) earlier this year, we've released 25 new versions, added support for 8 new languages, reworked the parsers so we could collaborate with Github on <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tree-sitter</a>, been joined by thousands of enthusiastic GitHub followers, and seen over 100K pulls of the Semgrep Docker image.</p>
<p>Our roadmap contains more program analysis features to support the sorts of secure-by-default enforcement that large technology companies are already leveraging so heavily (constant propagation, taint tracking, and more), as well as support for many more languages.</p>
<h2>Batteries Included</h2>
<p>Along with this release of Semgrep, we're announcing the availability of <a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep Community</a>, a free, hosted service for managing Semgrep CI as well as Semgrep Teams, a paid service which adds additional features for managing Semgrep that are useful for enterprises. Both these offerrings provide SaaS infrastructure for operating a modern AppSec program. They enable central definition of code standards for your projects and show results where you already work: GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, VS Code, and more.</p>
<p>We're also excited that <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep Registry</a> already has 900+ rules written by r2c and the community—you can start running on your project right now! Or if you like to DIY, <a href="https://semgrep.dev/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try writing your own</a>.</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<div>
<div>
<p>Recently I wrote an article on the <a href="https://www.melovedata.com/twitter-still-hasnt-unlocked-the-new-york-posts-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post’s Twitter account still being locked</a>. This is still the case,  and it made me brainstorm many other topics associated with elections . This thinking session brought up the topic of polls and predictions. How accurate are they? Why were many polls so far off in 2016? Why do polls seem to tighten the closer to election day? [<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/10/why-do-polls-always-tighten-right-before-an-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>][<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/dec/01/barack-obama/elections-tighten-almost-every-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>]</p>



<p>Many polls are predicting Biden to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">win by a large margin</a>, and many of the points I make below indicate factors that could make the margin much smaller. The one factor that could cause a greater margin than predicted would be an increase in Black and Hispanic voter participation. This is due to the fact that Biden still holds majority over those demographics so an increase in the total number of voters would benefit him the greatest.</p>



<h3>Here’s what I think the polls could be missing</h3>



<h5>Narrowing party registration gaps, especially in swing states.</h5>



<p>There are indications that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/voter-registration-republicans-swing-states-narrow-gap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Republicans have significantly closed the registered voter gap</a>, especially in swing states. Trump narrowly won the 2016 election in many of these states, so a lesser difference between registered Democrats and registered Republicans could indicate Trump holding his lead in swing states. Of course, non-affiliated voters still hold a large chunk (often 20%+) in swing states, so nothing is set in stone.</p>



<h5>Unwillingness for people to truthfully poll, especially for a candidate like Donald Trump. </h5>



<p>Some studies have shown that people are <a href="https://www.cloudresearch.com/resources/blog/election-2020-poll-respondent-honesty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unwilling to share their vote choice with polls</a>. The study linked states that around 11.7% of Republicans don’t share their truthful choice with polls, 10.5% of non-afiiliated, and 5.4% of Democrats. That’s certainly not insignificant.</p>



<h5>Shifting demographics in the Black and Hispanic vote. </h5>



<p>If the Black and Hispanic vote turnout is the same or less than 2016, this will be a net negative impact for the Democratic party. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-losing-ground-with-white-voters-but-gaining-among-black-and-hispanic-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump closed the polling gap from 2016 between both these demographics</a> (although still doesn’t poll above 50% for either demographic). So if the total pie of votes for Black and Hispanic voters doesn’t increase, Trump takes a bigger portion of a pie the same size as 2016.</p>



<h5>Increasing distrust of media and technology amongst conservatives.</h5>



<p>If a person doesn’t trust the news, believes they’re being censored, or is generally less trusting in institutions, why would they answer truthfully to polls? Why would they participate in the polls in the first place?  Are polls even further off than the “shy” voters study linked in the truthful poll section above?</p>



<h5>Unknown voter turnout for the Black and Hispanic vote.</h5>



<p>2016 saw a decrease in participation with these two demographics. If participation is higher than anticipated, it will significantly benefit Biden and result in a landslide win.</p>



<h3>Wrapping it up</h3>



<p>While many polls try to adjust for factors like these, it’s impossible to accurately measure all the variables associated with elections. For example, every time that Florida has seen under a 4% party registration spread, Republicans have won the state, anything above 4%, the Democrats have won. Right now the spread is under 2%. But mail-in voting will be at an all time high, so will overall participation increase or are only active voters shifting their voting method? </p>



<p>Many polls will correctly predict the election within their margin of error. The only issue is that it’s not useful in states consistently decided by less than the typical margin of error (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pennsylvania </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a>).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-10/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the Compiling a Lisp series. Last time, we learned about Intel
instruction encoding. This time, we’re going to use that knowledge to compile
procedure calls.</p>

<p>The usual function expression in Lisp is a <code>lambda</code> — an anonymous function
that can take arguments and close over variables. Procedure calls are <em>not</em>
this. They are simpler constructs that just take arguments and return values.</p>

<p>We’re adding procedure calls first as a stepping stone to full closure support.
This will help us get some kind of internal calling convention established and
stack manipulation figured out before things get too complicated.</p>

<p>After this post, we will be able to support programs like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>labels</span> <span>((</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>code</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>)))</span>
         <span>(</span><span>sub</span> <span>(</span><span>code</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>))))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>sub</span> <span>4</span> <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>add</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and even this snazzy factorial function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>labels</span> <span>((</span><span>factorial</span> <span>(</span><span>code</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> 
            <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>factorial</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>x</span> <span>1</span><span>)))))))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>factorial</span> <span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are fairly pedestrian snippets of code but they demonstrate some new
features we are adding, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new <code>labels</code> form that all programs will now have to look like</li>
  <li>A new <code>code</code> form for describing procedures and their parameters</li>
  <li>A new <code>labelcall</code> expression for calling procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>Ghuloum does not explain why he does this, but I imagine that the <code>labels</code> form
was chosen over allowing multiple separate top-level bindings because it is
easier to parse and traverse.</p>

<h3 id="big-ideas">Big ideas</h3>

<p>In order to compile a program, we are going to traverse every binding in the
<code>labels</code>. For each binding, we will generate code for each <code>code</code> object.</p>

<p>Compiling <code>code</code> objects requires making an environment for their parameters.
We’ll establish a calling convention later so that our compiler knows where to
find the parameters.</p>

<p>Then, once we’ve emitted all the code for the bindings, we will compile the
body. The body may, but is not required to, contain a <code>labelcall</code> expression.</p>

<p>In order to compile a <code>labelcall</code> expression, we will compile all of the
arguments provided, save them in consecutive locations on the stack, and then
emit a <code>call</code> instruction.</p>

<p>When all of these pieces come together, the resulting machine code will look
something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mov rsi, rdi  # prologue
label0:
  label0_code
label1:
  label1_code
main:
  main_code
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that all of the <code>code</code> objects will be compiled in sequence,
followed by the body of the <code>labels</code> form.</p>

<s>
Because I have not yet figured out how to start executing at somewhere other
than the beginning of the generated code, and because I don't store generated
code in any intermediate buffers, and because we don't know the sizes of any
code in advance, I do this funky thing where I emit a `jmp` to the body code.

If you, dear reader, have a better solution, please let me know.
</s>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>jsmith45</em> gave me the encouragement I needed to work on this again.
It turns out that storing the code offset of the beginning of the <code>main_code</code>
(the <code>labels</code> body) adding that to the <code>buf-&gt;address</code> works just fine. I’ll
explain more below.</p>

<h3 id="a-calling-convention">A calling convention</h3>

<p>We’re not going to use the System V AMD64 ABI. That calling convention requires
that parameters are passed first in certain registers, and then on the stack.
Instead, we will pass all parameters on the stack.</p>

<p>This makes our code simpler, but it also means that at some point later on, we
will have to add a different kind of calling convention so that we can call
foreign functions (like <code>printf</code>, or <code>exit</code>, or something). Those functions
expect their parameters in registers. We’ll worry about that later.</p>

<p>If we borrow and adapt the excellent diagrams from the Ghuloum tutorial, this
means that right before we make a procedure call, our stack will look like
this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stack illustration courtesy of <a href="https://leonardschuetz.ch/">Leonard</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see the first return point at <code>[rsp]</code>. This is the return point placed
by the caller of the <em>current</em> function.</p>

<p>Above that are whatever local variables we have declared with <code>let</code> or perhaps
are intermediate values from some computation.</p>

<p>Above that is a blank space reserved for the second return point. This is the
return point for the <em>about-to-be-called</em> function. The <code>call</code> instruction will
fill in after evaluating all the arguments.</p>

<p>Above the return point are all the outgoing arguments. They will appear as
locals for the procedure being called.</p>

<p>Finally, above the arguments, is untouched free stack space.</p>

<p>The <code>call</code> instruction decrements <code>rsp</code> and then writes to <code>[rsp]</code>. This means
that if we just emitted a <code>call</code>, the first local would be overwritten. No
good. Worse, the way the stack would be laid out would mean that the locals
would look like arguments.</p>

<p>In order to solve this problem, we need to first adjust <code>rsp</code> to point to the
last local. That way the decrement will move it below the local and the return
address will go between the locals and the arguments.</p>

<p>After the <code>call</code> instruction, the stack will look different. Nothing will have
actually changed, except for <code>rsp</code>. This change to <code>rsp</code> means that the callee
has a different view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stack illustration courtesy of <a href="https://leonardschuetz.ch/">Leonard</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The empty colored in spaces below the return point indicate that the values on
the stack are “hidden” from view, since they are above (higher addresses than)
<code>[rsp]</code>. The called function will <em>not</em> be able to access those values.</p>

<p>If the called function wants to use one of its arguments, it can pull it off
the stack from its designated location.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One unfortunate consequence of this calling convention is that Valgrind does
not understand it. Valgrind cannot understand that the caller has placed data
on the stack specifically for the callee to read it, and thinks this is a
move/jump of an uninitialized value. This means that we get some errors now
on these labelcall tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, when the function returns, the <code>ret</code> instruction will pop the
return point off the stack and jump to it. This will bring us back to the
previous call frame.</p>

<p>That’s that! I have yet to find a good tool that will let me visualize the
stack as a program is executing. GDB probably has a mode hidden away somewhere
undocumented that does exactly this. Cutter sort of does, but it’s finicky in
ways I don’t really understand. Maybe one day <a href="http://akkartik.name/">Kartik</a>’s
x86-64 Mu fork will be able to do this.</p>

<h3 id="building-procedure-calls-in-small-pieces">Building procedure calls in small pieces</h3>

<p>In order for this set of changes to make sense, I am going to explain all of
the pieces one at a time, top-down.</p>

<p>First, we’ll look at the new-and-improved <code>Compile_entry</code>, which has been
updated to handle the <code>labels</code> form. This will do the usual Lisp entrypoint
setup and some checks about the structure of the AST.</p>

<p>Then, we’ll actually look at compiling the <code>labels</code>. This means going through
the bindings one-by-one and compiling their <code>code</code> objects.</p>

<p>Then, we’ll look at what it means to compile a <code>code</code> object. Hint: it’s very
much like <code>let</code>.</p>

<p>Last, we’ll tie it all together when compiling the body of the <code>labels</code> form.</p>

<h3 id="compiling-the-entrypoint">Compiling the entrypoint</h3>

<p>Most of this code is checking. What used to just compile an expression now
validates that what we’ve passed in at least vaguely looks like a well-formed
<code>labels</code> form before picking it into its component parts: the <code>bindings</code> and
the <code>body</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_entry</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>Compile_entry</code> dispatches to <code>Compile_labels</code> for iterating over all of the
labels. <code>Compile_labels</code> is a recursive function that keeps track of all the
labels so far in its arguments, so we start it off with an empty <code>labels</code>
environment.</p>

<h3 id="compiling-labels">Compiling labels</h3>

<p>In <code>Compile_labels</code>, we have first a base case: if there are no labels we
should just emit the body.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_labels</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>bindings</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>body</span><span>,</span>

    <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also set the buffer entrypoint location to the position where we’re going to
emit the body of the <code>labels</code>. We’ll use this later when executing, or later in
the series when we emit ELF binaries. You’ll have to add a field <code>word
entrypoint</code> to your <code>Buffer</code> struct.</p>

<p>We pass in an empty <code>varenv</code>, since we are not accumulating any locals along
the way; only labels. For the same reason, we give a <code>stack_index</code> of
<code>-kWordSize</code> — the first slot.</p>

<p>If we <em>do</em> have labels, on the other hand, we should deal with the first label.
This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pulling out the name and the code object</li>
  <li>binding the name to the <code>code</code> location (the current location)</li>
  <li>compiling the <code>code</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And then from there we deal with the others recursively.</p>

Sorry once again for the infrequent posts.
I've been busy.
Originally, because I was supposed to get married this summer.
Then because my fiancée cheated on me while I was watching my grandfather die

So that's been fun, but I'm trying to get back into some more productive habits.
Hopefully that includes blogging regularly.

<h2 id="sum-types-and-you">Sum Types and You</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about a simple, yet powerful concept in programming: <em>sum types</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A sum type, also called a <em>discriminated union</em>,
can hold one (and only one) of several types of things.
For example, consider some settings in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a>-like configuration file.
Let’s say that each setting must be a string, an integer, or a Boolean value.
If we wanted to roll our own solution in C++, we might write something resembling:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Setting</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>str</span><span>;</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
        <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>enum</span> <span>Type</span> <span>{</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>};</span>
    <span>Type</span> <span>tag</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// Map settings to their names.
</span><span>using</span> <span>Settings</span> <span>=</span> <span>unordered_map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>Setting</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here be dragons, though, since we must always remember to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Update <code>tag</code> whenever assigning a new value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only retrieve the correct type from the union (according to <code>tag</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call constructors and destructors at appropriate times for all non-trivial types.
(<code>string</code> is the only one here, but you could imagine similar
scenarios with others.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a step is ever forgotten, the object falls into an
inconsistent state and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
You could encapsulate all this trickery and interact with the type
through a series of methods—e.g., <code>getType()</code>, <code>asBool()</code>,
<code>asString()</code>, and so on—but this is quite verbose.
It also just shifts the problem onto whoever implements these methods; they
still need to carefully maintain the invariants with no help from the language.</p>

<p>It would be much nicer if a general-purpose sum type was provided by the standard
library.
In C++17, we finally get one!
It’s called <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant"><code>std::variant</code></a>.
Let’s take a look.</p>

<h2 id="using-stdvariant">Using <code>std::variant</code></h2>

<p><code>variant</code> is a class template that takes, as template parameters, the types
it could hold.
For the example above,
we could define a setting as a <code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span></code>.
Assigning a value to a <code>variant</code> works just like you might expect:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>string</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once we put a value into a <code>variant</code>, we’ll eventually want to look at what that
value is, and just as importantly, what the type of the value is.
This is where the fun begins.
Some languages offer dedicated <em>pattern matching</em> syntax for the task,
such as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>theSetting</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Str</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Int</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Bool</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>),</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>but this didn’t make the cut for C++17.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Instead we’re given a companion function called <code>std::visit</code>.
It takes the <code>variant</code> you want to examine, along with
some <em>visitor</em> that is callable for each type in the variant.</p>

<p>How do we define such a visitor?
One way is to create an object that overloads the call operator
for relevant types:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SettingVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This seems terribly verbose, and it gets even worse
if we want our visitor to capture or modify some other state.
Hmm—<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7627218">lambdas</a> are perfect
for capturing state.
What if we could build a visitor from those?</p>
<div><pre><code><span>make_visitor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"bool: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That’s a bit better, but the standard library doesn’t provide any sort of
<code>make_visitor</code> to combine the lambdas into a callable object for us.
We’ll need to define it ourselves.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Fs</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>;</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F0</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span>

    <span>using</span> <span>F0</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>();</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here we use C++11’s <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack">variadic templates</a>.
They must be defined recursively, so we create some base case <code>F0</code>,
then use that to define a cascading set of constructors for <code>overload</code>,
each of which peels off a lambda argument and adds it to the type
as a call operator.</p>

<p>If this seems troublesome, fear not! C++17 will offer a new syntax
that reduces all of the above to:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>struct</span> <span>overloaded</span> <span>:</span> <span>Ts</span><span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>using</span> <span>Ts</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>()...;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>(</span><span>Ts</span><span>...)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ts</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, right? But if don’t like any of these options, you could
use C++17’s compile-time conditionals instead:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>[](</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>decay_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"bool: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Much better, no?</p>

<h2 id="no">No.</h2>

<p>The rigmarole needed for <code>std::visit</code> is entirely insane.
We started with a simple goal: look at the contents of a sum type.
To accomplish this meager mission, we had to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define a function object, which requires a lot of
boilerplate, <em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Define our behavior with lambdas, which required:
    <ul>
      <li>An understanding of variadic templates, in all their recursively-defined fun, <em>or</em></li>
      <li>A familiarity with variadic <code>using</code> declarations, fresh on the scene from C++17.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Use compile-time conditionals, which require you to know
about—and grok—the new <code><span>constexpr</span> <span>if</span></code> syntax, along with
<code>type_traits</code> fun like
<code>std::decay</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these concepts are too enigmatic if you’re an experienced C++ developer,
but several are certainly “advanced” features of the language.
Things have really gone sideways if we need to know so much
to do something so simple.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>

<p>My goal isn’t to disparage the folks on the ISO C++ committee
who picked this approach.
I’ve had beers with some of them,
and they’re smart, kind, hardworking people.
I’m sure that I’m missing important context since I’ve never sat in on a
standards meeting or read all of the relevant
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/">committee papers</a>.
But from an outsider’s perspective, the disparity in complexity between the
problem being solved (“What’s in here?”)
and the solutions is just nuts.
How do you teach this without overwhelming a beginner with all this other…
stuff?
Is it expected to be common knowledge for your everyday programmer?
(And if the goal of adding <code>variant</code> to the standard library <em>isn’t</em> to
make it a tool for the masses, shouldn’t it be?)
The very least C++17 could do—if the committee didn’t have the time or resources
to get pattern matching into the language—is provide something akin to <code>make_visitor</code>.
But that too is left as an exercise for the user.</p>

<p>If I had to guess how we ended up this way,
I’d assume it comes down to confirmation bias.
Maybe when a bunch of really smart people who know how
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a> works offhand
and don’t flinch when they see the likes of</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>F</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>typename</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if</span><span>&lt;!</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_reference</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>type</span>
<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>F</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>get together, the result is something like <code>std::visit</code>.
Nobody proclaims that the emperor has no clothes, or that it’s completely
bonkers to expect the average user to build an overloaded callable
object with recursive templates just to see if the thing they’re looking at
holds an <code><span>int</span></code> or a <code><span>string</span></code>.</p>

<p>I’m also not here to claim that C++ is too complicated for its own good,
but it’s certainly more complicated than it has to be.
Scott Meyers, the guy who wrote <em>Effective&nbsp;C++</em> and <em>Effective Modern&nbsp;C++</em>,
has made similar noises in <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/47947981">recent</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/RT46MpK39rQ?t=29m51s">talks</a>.
To paraphrase Meyers, I’m sure each member of the committee cares very much
about avoiding needless complexity and making the language easier to use.
But if you look at the results of their work, it’s hard to tell.
The accidental complexity just keeps stacking up.</p>

<h2 id="where-are-we-headed">Where are we headed?</h2>

<p>There’s a reason C++ is so widely used, especially in systems programming.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
It can be incredibly expressive, yet gives you nearly full control of your hardware.
The tooling around it is some of the most mature of any programming language
out there, bar C.
It supports a ridiculous number of platforms.</p>

<p>But even if you set aside all the historical baggage, it has some serious shortcomings.
Spend any amount of time messing with D and you’ll quickly realize that
metaprogramming needn’t require self-flagellation and insane syntax.
Play with Rust and <!-- Hi, PCJ --> you’ll feel like <code>unique_ptr</code>
and <code>shared_ptr</code>—which themselves have been a breath of fresh air—are
a bad joke.
The fact that we still handle dependencies in 2017
by literally copy-pasting files into each other with <code><span>#include</span></code>
macros is <em>obscene</em>.</p>

<p>You get the impression, based on what ends up in the ISO standards and what
you hear in conference talks,
that those driving C++ are trying to eliminate some of these shortcomings by
glomming nice bits from other languages onto it.
That’s a great idea on its face,
but these features often seem to arrive half-baked.
While C++ isn’t going away any time soon,
it feels like the language is constantly playing a clumsy game of catchup.</p>

<hr>

<p>In spite of all of this,
I’ll be busy encouraging my coworkers to use <code>variant</code> if anybody needs me.
Sum types are such a useful concept that they’re worth the pain,
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvtFGa6XJDU">to quote Jon Kalb</a>,
“If you can’t program in a language with ugly warts, maybe C++ isn’t the language
you should be programming in.”</p>

We would need to include code to drive the motor appropriately and the price per-part is high compared to a simple potentiometer or rotary encoder.</p><p>Touch screens were immediately ruled out for being way too general-purpose and requiring much more code to implement.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://blog.tonari.no/images/ada061a5-45bd-44c3-b6c7-e116fb7dca84-IMG_7150.jpg.optimized.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.tonari.no/images/ada061a5-45bd-44c3-b6c7-e116fb7dca84-IMG_7150.jpg.optimized.jpg"><img src="https://blog.tonari.no/images/ada061a5-45bd-44c3-b6c7-e116fb7dca84-IMG_7150.jpg.optimized.jpg"></picture><figcaption><p>(the kind of thing we're trying to avoid...)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Up/down buttons could work and be a very simple solution, but they're not very satisfying and are borderline annoying when you need to change the volume by a large margin.</p><p>That left us with rotary encoders. They're very inexpensive, fairly easy to write firmware to read from one, they can tell you which direction they're turning and roughly how fast, and some even come combined with a push button.

All we knew was that we wanted control over brightness and color temperature, and ideally they could provide a high lumen output. "Smart" lighting like Phillips Hue was out of the question — they're more consumer oriented and typically require apps with a bluetooth or WiFi connection in order to control them.</p><p>Some brief research into this problem introduced me to DALI — Digital Addressable Lighting Interface. I read up on DALI for a few minutes and was convinced it was something we wanted to stay far away from. It's likely useful for huge networks of lights in warehouses or something like that, but for our situation where we're only controlling a few lights in the immediate area, it looked like extreme overkill.</p><p>Another complication is <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/video/tips-and-solutions/flicker-free-lights-and-why-they-are-important-you" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><m>light flicker</m></a>. Put simply, any sort of lighting flicker in a video is headache-inducing and unacceptable, especially at the wall-sizes tonari works at. We evaluated as many LED light bars as we could get our hands on, testing them on our camera setups at various frame rates. The funny thing about Japan is that their electrical system is split more or less down the middle: it's 60Hz in the west and 50Hz in the east.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://blog.tonari.no/images/a1f7994d-1403-4fd1-a9e4-844328e1cbdf-frequencies_map.jpg.optimized.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.tonari.no/images/a1f7994d-1403-4fd1-a9e4-844328e1cbdf-frequencies_map.jpg.optimized.jpg"><img src="https://blog.tonari.no/images/a1f7994d-1403-4fd1-a9e4-844328e1cbdf-frequencies_map.jpg.optimized.jpg"></picture><figcaption><p>(Source: <a href="http://www.rikuden.co.jp/eng_electricity/frequencies.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.rikuden.co.jp/eng_electricity/frequencies.html</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>We run our cameras at 60 FPS when we can but sometimes in the 50Hz region we have to drop to 50 FPS to remove light flicker <m>from the existing light sources</m>.

They don't have flicker at the frame rates we run, they're affordable, bright, they support brightness and color temperature control, and their hardware control circuit seemed simple enough to plug in a custom controller.</p><p>Their brightness and color temperature seemed to be completely controlled by PWM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pulse-width modulation</a>) — it was written right on the dimmer panel.

It's Quadrature Encoder Interface, which is a type of rotary encoder, and happens to be the kind of encoder I purchased to experiment on! The STM32 chips have built-in hardware for decoding rotary encoders??? No way, that's too convenient. I wrote up a quick sample, connected the encoder to the correct pins on the microcontroller, and I was getting valid input from turning the dial, just like that.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Today, we’re proud to announce the release of <a href="https://memgraph.com/download">Memgraph 1.2</a>, which significantly improves Memgraph’s compatibility with the broader graph ecosystem. This makes it easier for developers and data scientists to work with Memgraph using their favourite tools.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes in this release, is the addition of Bolt v4 and v4.1 support.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore what exactly is the Bolt protocol, what it brings to the table, and how we implemented it into Memgraph.</p>
<h2>The Bolt Protocol</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking about using Memgraph in your application, one of the
requirements is the possibility of querying Memgraph directly from your
application with as little effort as possible. You can achieve that by writing
drivers for the Memgraph server in the language you want to support. Drivers are
special libraries that follow predefined rules, aka a protocol, to communicate between
your application and a server.</p>
<p>Instead of defining its own rules, Memgraph decided to use Neo4j’s protocol
called <a href="https://7687.org/">Bolt</a>. There are 3 important reasons for this
decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defining a protocol is not easy</li>
<li>Neo4j also uses <a href="https://www.opencypher.org/">Cypher</a> (that doesn’t mean that the Bolt protocol can’t be used for other query languages!)</li>
<li>By supporting Neo4j’s protocol we automatically become compatible with their drivers</li>
</ol>
<p>The drivers that Neo4j currently maintains are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver">Java Driver</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver">JavaScript Driver</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver">.NET Driver</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver">Python Driver</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver">Go Driver</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, by making our server compatible with the Bolt protocol, you can
use Memgraph in any of the languages and frameworks listed above just by using
Neo4j’s libraries.</p>
<h3>Bolt Protocol Rule Examples</h3>
<p>First, we need to know how to exchange messages. Bolt exchanges its messages using a request-response pattern between the client and the server. Each request message can be followed by zero or record messages  which are then followed by one summary message. The different possibilities for record messages depends on the type of the request message.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>A record message is a type of message which contains records, aka result rows.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also, we need to know how to serialize our data. Bolt uses its own
<a href="https://7687.org/packstream/packstream-specification-1.html#version1">PackStream</a> which provides specification for serializing a bunch of different types of data. It is fully compatible with the types
supported by Cypher. We won’t go into details but every type is defined with its marker, its size and its data.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2GkXojm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <em><a href="https://7687.org/packstream/packstream-specification-1.html">https://7687.org/packstream/packstream-specification-1.html</a></em></p>
<p>One of those types is a structure. The size of the structure defines how many fields
it contains and the fields can be of any other type. But we’re missing an
important information. How do we know what the structure represents? Structures
carry additional data, its tag byte. This tag tells us what does the structure
represent. We’re now half way through to understanding how to define request and
response messages.</p>
<p>We can’t expect that our data will always be small enough to send it all at
once. To solve this problem, Bolt defines how the message is chunked. Each chunk
is starts with two-byte header that tells us the size of chunk data in bytes
followed by the chunk data itself. Now, we have another problem. How do we know
if we received the last chunk of message? We just add a marker! In our case we
append to the end of the last chunk <code>00 00</code>.</p>
<p>Now, we have everything we need to define our messages. We can define each type
of request/response message as a unique structure, having a unique set of fields.
We can send the defined structure using the chunking method defined before.
We’re set! We can serialize and deserialize messages now!</p>
<h4>Bolt Protocol Specifications</h4>
<p>A good protocol specification should contain as much information as possible.
Without enough information, we can only guess how our server or client should
behave in some situations, causing a lot of headache for every developer that
tries to implement that protocol.</p>
<p>So, as a good protocol, Bolt defines how to parse different types of request
message and send the correct response message. It defines how each request
message looks and what to send as a response message in each possible
situation. Also, it defines the state of server after each request message and
its outcome.</p>
<p>If want to delve deeper into the Bolt Protocol specifications, you can find everything <a href="https://7687.org/">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>Implementing rules is not hard, but to do it efficiently requires a lot of
careful planning and having a good understanding of how the protocol works.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Evolution of the Bolt Protocol</h2>
<p>As with any software, protocols are susceptible to change. Bolt defines it’s
version using major and minor versions. At the start of each connection, the
client needs to do a handshake with the server.</p>
<p>The handshake is really simple and consists of only two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>client sends at most 4 versions it supports, sorted by priority</li>
<li>server responds with the first version in the list it supports</li>
</ul>
<h3>But doesn’t Memgraph support Bolt protocol?</h3>
<p>Yes, Memgraph does support the Bolt protocol. But up until now, it only supported Bolt v1, while the current version is 4.1. By looking at the handshake process we can conclude that the client can support <strong>at most</strong> four versions. The logical thinking is that the client will always support the latest 4 versions. At the time of writing this, the latest version is v4.1, which pushed v1 out of the support list, making us, and everyone else that wanted to try Memgraph using Neo4j’s drivers, very sad.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OC6Tzd2.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to emphasize that after version 1.0, newer versions weren’t documented,
which made keeping up with the newer versions really hard. But, after v4.1, Neo4j
decided to document every version nicely making our lives much easier. Thanks
Neo4j!</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Road to Bolt v4.(1)</h2>
<p>Since Memgraph was only compatible with the first version of the Bolt protocol, we had three major and one minor version change to catch up with.Most of it was just some basic additions to the already existing messages, but there were also some bigger changes. For example, we made the decision to preserve support for Bolt v1. This has been very challenging as one of the hardest things in programming is making bigger changes to an existing code while not breaking the old behaviour.</p>
<h3>Supporting multiple versions</h3>
<p>Handling a code that behaves differently for each version can be hard. After we
decide on a version for a specific connection, we need to be careful which messages
are allowed for that version, which response should each message produce, what
parameters are allowed, and many more things. And to do that while reusing as much
of code as possible, with the addition of keeping the readability can be a challenge.
The only real advice I can give you here is write as many tests that will cover as
much as possible because a smallest detail can make your server misbehave while
implementing a support for a protocol.</p>
<h3>Making transaction handling easier and more powerful</h3>
<p>In Bolt v3, new request messages for handling transactions were added. Those messages
are for starting an explicit transaction and ending the transaction by
committing or rollbacking the changes.
Because we already had support for transactions and you could already do
the same thing by running queries consisting of <code>BEGIN</code>, <code>COMMIT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK</code>
commands, the only thing we had to do was add functions that directly run those
queries when the corresponding request was received.</p>
<h3>Getting some results from here and some from there</h3>
<p>The biggest change to the Bolt protocol was the change to the <code>PULL</code> and
<code>DISCARD</code> message.
Before we delve deeper, let’s explain those messages.
When you want to run a query on a server using Bolt messages, first you need to
send a <code>RUN</code> message that contains the query we want to execute. To get the results
of the query we send a <code>PULL</code> message, and if we want to discard the results,
we simply send the <code>DISCARD</code> message. The natural way of handling this is preparing
the query when we receive the <code>RUN</code> message and executing it when we receive the
<code>PULL</code> message. Additionally, to avoid wasting memory, we don’t keep the result, we
just forward it to the encoder and send it directly to the client.</p>
<p>In Bolt v1, there were <code>PULL_ALL</code> and <code>DISCARD_ALL</code> messages. As their name suggests,
the only options you had was all or nothing. Taking this into account, we developed
a solution that would simply stream all the results to the client after it receives
<code>PULL_ALL</code> message. But, since v4.0, things got a little more complicated.
The <code>PULL_ALL</code> message was renamed to <code>PULL</code>. Additionally, the <code>PULL</code> message can come with some extra parameters.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ibg9Db.png" alt=""></p>
<h4><code>n</code> parameter</h4>
<p>You can now pull an arbitrary number of results. This small change implies a lot of
changes to the existing code. The easiest solution would be to execute the query on the
first pull and save all of the results in memory. After that, for each pull, we just
send next <code>n</code> results. Even though it’s the easiest solution to implement, it’s too
inefficient memory-wise. Taking this into account, we have a hard requirement of
keeping the old, lazy behaviour while not keeping any of the results in memory.</p>
<p>There are different types of queries and each query demands a different approach to
achieve this behaviour. Queries with a constant size of the result, like profiling and
explain queries, can have a simple vector of results from which the results are
lazily pulled. For most of the queries that have variable size of the result, we
prepare all the necessary resources for the execution and ask for the next result only
when it’s needed after which the results are streamed instantly to the client.
The resources are cleaned after the <code>PULL</code> request that returned the
last result. This is possible because of Memgraph’s lazy way of handling the execution.</p>
<p>The query that was surprisingly the hardest to implement lazily was the <code>DUMP</code> query.
By itself, it’s really simple to implement this query. You analyse different parts of
your database and, as a result, send a query that defines that part. For example, we
iterate each vertex in our database, and we send back …</p></div></div>

<p>Alton Brown famously hates single use kitchen gadgets, which he calls <em>unitaskers</em>:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgFeVlw2Ywg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>And yet the Unix philosophy says that programs should “do one thing and do it well.” Why does it work for command line tools but not kitchen gadgets?</p>



<p><em>(You may say “uh, because kitchen gadgets have nothing to do with command line tools?” And you’re right, but shut up. I’m cooking up a metaphor here.)</em></p>



<p>The answer is that Unix programs are chain-able. They integrate with each other. You can pipe the output from one into the input of another. That’s actually the lesser known second part of the Unix philosophy: “Write programs to work together.”</p>



<p>Kitchen gadgets are standalone. You can’t hook a strawberry slicer up to an egg cooker and expect magic to happen.</p>



<p>There’s a lesson here. Standalone development tools with generic inputs and outputs are good. Those tools follow the Unix philosophy. </p>



<p>But standalone development tools that you can’t pipe together are bad. Those are the single use kitchen gadgets of the development world. It’d be better to choose a tool that does many things than a tool that does one thing and only works in a silo.</p>



<p>I like to talk about Unix vs. Me-nix vs. We-nix (get it?).</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Unix philosophy: “Do one thing and do it well.”</strong></li><li><strong>The Me-nix philosophy: “Do one thing and go to hell.”</strong></li><li><strong>The We-nix philosophy: “Do lots of things pretty well.”</strong></li></ul>



<p>To take a real life example: say you’re building a recommendation engine. You could reach for something like AWS Personalize, a single use kitchen gadget (aka a Me-nix tool). Or you could grab something like Neo4j, a graph database that does lots of things including recommendations (aka a We-nix tool).</p>



<p>Go with AWS Personalize and you’ll be happy as long as you’re in its core use case. But say you grow out of that. Maybe you need to store and retrieve some arbitrary data about the user. Then it’s time to integrate. </p>



<p>And since integration with AWS Personalize isn’t as simple as piping, you’re going to have a bad time. You’ll be dealing with duplicate user records stored in many systems. You’ll need data in one system to inform data in the other. It all gets very mucky.</p>



<p>If only you had ditched the Me-nix tool and reached for the We-nix tool. You could have had a single source of truth for all of that arbitrary data, <em>and</em> generated recommendations based on it. </p>



<p>My rule of thumb is that Unix tools are best, but if you can’t find one, choose a We-nix tool over a Me-nix tool.</p>

    <p>I’ve been thinking about what it means to own something. The definition that resonated the most with me is this<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You own what you can pass down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It used to be common decades ago for people to pass down their property including media (vinyl records, disks, cassettes). You paid for hard assets that you owned.</p>

<p>Objectively, it’s easier to hold on to, and pass down, digital assets - you just have to change the “ownership” field in a database, or hand over a hard drive.</p>

<p>Instead, we got <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/drm">Digital Rights Management</a>. DRM comprises of tools to lock down <em>who</em> has access to content, <em>where</em> it can be accessed, and for <em>how long</em>.</p>

<p>Simply put, if you buy an album on iTunes, it’s DRM protected. You cannot watch it on an Android device. Legally, you can’t even share it with your partner or family.</p>

<p>If you buy an ebook on Amazon, you merely get a license to read it. If Amazon decides they don’t like you as a customer and delete your account, you lose your book. Or, if your Kindle dies, you can’t just open the book on your computer or phone.</p>

<p>Using DRM, media companies can prosecute anyone that trying to transfer a Blu-Ray movie to their own computer.</p>

<p>That’s not ownership. In the digital age, we merely borrow when we “buy”.</p>

<p>To me, I only own media if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I can store it on any device I own</li>
  <li>I can transfer it freely between devices I own</li>
  <li>I can consume it through any device<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>The seller cannot take it away from me</li>
  <li>I can transfer ownership freely</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on that criteria, the following are not ownership:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Netflix, Spotify, Pandora (is that still a thing) etc</li>
  <li>iTunes</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/03/01/do_you_truly_own_your_e_books/">Kindle books</a></li>
  <li>Blu-Ray disks (and some DVDs)</li>
  <li>Gaming console disks, or digital games (Steam)</li>
</ul>

<p>The only media marketplace I use that meets that criteria is <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> where you buy music directly from artists and get to download it.</p>

<p><img src="https://goel.io/assets/img/posts/2020/2020-07-02-ownership-drm.png" alt="">
<em><a href="https://nadasurf.bandcamp.com/">Nada Surf</a> is an awesome alt-rock band!</em></p>

<p>I prefer straight up MP3 files. That’s what doing digital media the right way looks like.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. For creators piracy is a big problem. Some common reasons for piracy and illegal media sharing are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not available in consumers’ region</li>
  <li>Delayed release in consumers’ region</li>
  <li>Not convenient to purchase</li>
  <li>Not convenient to consume the media (DRM)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, DRM is not a solution. It’s a duct tape on a crumbling building.</p>

<p>I do recognize that creators have bills and should be paid fairly for their work. I will continue to pay for my media (that’s both “bought” and <em>bought</em>) as well support creators directly (Patreon etc).</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="footnote1">1</a>: I did not come up with this, but I also can’t find out where I read/watched/listened this idea. If you do, let me know.</p>

<p><a name="footnote2">2</a>: I don’t necessarily mean that if the latest video or audio codec is not supported on Android for example, then the media encoded in that codec breaks my criterion. However the codec spec must be open and not proprietary for alternative implementations.</p>

This post encompasses the basics of graphs, the amalgamation of graphs and deep learning, and a basic idea about graph neural networks and their applications. We will also briefly discuss on how to build graphs with a Python library called NetworkX</p><p id="e390"><em>So, let’s dive right in!</em></p><p id="d06d">In the world of computer science, graphs are a type of data structure having two components: Nodes (or vertices) and edges, which connect two nodes. Thus, a graph can be defined as a collection of loosely inter-connected nodes via edges.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7954/1*1ASEWlSzqsGJdDwht4Pi0Q.jpeg" width="3977" height="1690" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*1ASEWlSzqsGJdDwht4Pi0Q.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*1ASEWlSzqsGJdDwht4Pi0Q.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*1ASEWlSzqsGJdDwht4Pi0Q.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1ASEWlSzqsGJdDwht4Pi0Q.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*1ASEWlSzqsGJdDwht4Pi0Q.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://medium.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph-dd2b72c32f1f" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph-dd2b72c32f1f</a></figcaption></figure><p id="8e01">The<strong> </strong>nodes of a graph can be homogenous with all nodes having a similar structure, or heterogenous nodes having different types of structure. The edges define the relationship one node has with another. Edges can be bidirectional (from one node u to another v and vice versa), or unidirectional (from one node u to another node v). Edges can also be weighted — having a weight assigned to the edge that might depict the edge’s cost or importance.</p><p id="b3da"><em>An example:</em> Let us suppose a graph to be considered as a network of cities — the cities under observation being nodes and the roads connecting them being edges. Now, there can be various types of relevant problems that can be solved with graphs, such as finding out the shortest distance between cities (where roads can also be weighted as per the condition of the roads or traffic), or finding the cities which are well-connected to each other, etc.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1300/1*ao-FSJHJ-cGU_yYCxTOA3A.png" width="650" height="404" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ao-FSJHJ-cGU_yYCxTOA3A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ao-FSJHJ-cGU_yYCxTOA3A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ao-FSJHJ-cGU_yYCxTOA3A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1300/1*ao-FSJHJ-cGU_yYCxTOA3A.png 650w" sizes="650px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ao-FSJHJ-cGU_yYCxTOA3A.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/773-swift-algorithm-club-graphs-with-adjacency-list" rel="noopener">https://www.raywenderlich.com/773-swift-algorithm-club-graphs-with-adjacency-list</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="878f">What are Graph Neural Networks (GNN)?</h2><p id="85e3">Graphs have tremendous expressive powers and are therefore gaining a lot of attention in the field of machine learning. Every node has an embedding associated with it that defines the node in the data space. Graph neural networks refer to the neural network architectures that operate on a graph. The aim of a GNN is for each node in the graph to learn an embedding containing information about its neighborhood (nodes directly connected to the target node via edges). This embedding can then be used for different problems like node labelling, node prediction, edge prediction, etc.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2286/1*7VzFWjVoAdqrDBRQWCPvnA.png" width="1143" height="508" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*7VzFWjVoAdqrDBRQWCPvnA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*7VzFWjVoAdqrDBRQWCPvnA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*7VzFWjVoAdqrDBRQWCPvnA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*7VzFWjVoAdqrDBRQWCPvnA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*7VzFWjVoAdqrDBRQWCPvnA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Each node and its neighborhood</figcaption></figure><p id="8b2f">Thus, after having embeddings associated with each node, we can convert edges by adding feed forward neural network layers and combine graphs and neural networks.</p><h2 id="b3df">Need for Graph Neural Networks</h2><p id="e37c">The need for graph neural networks arose from the fact that a lot of data available to us is in an unstructured format. Unstructured data is data that has not been processed or does not have a pre-defined format which makes it difficult to analyze. Examples of such data are audio, emails, and social media postings. To make sense of this data and to derive inferences from it, we need a structure that defines a relationship between these unstructured data points. The existing machine learning architectures and algorithms do not seem to perform well with these kinds of data. The primary advantages of graph neural networks are:</p><ol><li id="02e9">The graph data structure has proven tremendously successful in the field of computer science while working with unstructured data.</li><li id="43bd">Graphs are helpful in defining concepts which are abstract, like relationships between entities. Since each node in the graph is defined by its connections and neighbors, graph neural networks can capture the relationships between nodes in an efficient manner.</li></ol><p id="7936">Thus, developing GNNs for handling data like social network data, which is highly unstructured, is an exciting amalgamation of graphs and machine learning which holds a lot of potential.</p><h2 id="2fd5">Real-Life Applications of Graph Neural Network</h2><p id="58cb">Being introduced recently in 2018, the GNNs still have a lot of real-life applications because their architecture resonates with the irregularity in data collected from various sources. Currently, GNNs have been the hot topic for:</p><p id="6e5a"><strong>Social Network Analysis</strong> — Similar posts prediction, tags prediction, and recommending content to users.</p><p id="d34c"><strong>Natural Sciences </strong>— GNNs have also gained popularity in dealing with molecular interactions like protein-protein interactions.</p><p id="8b9e"><strong>Recommender Systems </strong>— A heterogenous graph can be used to capture relationships between users and items to recommend relevant items to a buyer.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="a689">After we have the basic structure of the graph neural network (nodes with their embeddings and edges with feed forward layers), we can move forward to understanding how GNNs actually work.</p><p id="0827">The basic idea is to learn neighborhood embeddings by aggregating information from a node’s neighbors via edges using neural networks.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2310/1*lPaI-f9FdVIQCmui2ljn2g.png" width="1155" height="537" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*lPaI-f9FdVIQCmui2ljn2g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*lPaI-f9FdVIQCmui2ljn2g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*lPaI-f9FdVIQCmui2ljn2g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*lPaI-f9FdVIQCmui2ljn2g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lPaI-f9FdVIQCmui2ljn2g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Image source: <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/embeddings-www/files/nrltutorial-part2-gnns.pdf" rel="noopener">http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/embeddings-www/files/nrltutorial-part2-gnns.pdf</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="0f02">Neighborhood Aggregation or Message Passing</h2><p id="99a1">Message passing refers to passing and receiving information between nodes about its neighborhood. Consider a target node having its initial embeddings: It receives information from its neighbors passed via edge neural networks. Data from these edges are aggregated (many techniques are used, like max pooling, averaging, etc.,) and passed to the activation unit of a node to get a new set of embeddings for the node. Every node in the initial setup has features x_v. The embeddings for each node after message passing can be defined as:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1708/1*XI7j33ktxcDbdqlHiUSBoQ.png" width="854" height="134" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*XI7j33ktxcDbdqlHiUSBoQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*XI7j33ktxcDbdqlHiUSBoQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*XI7j33ktxcDbdqlHiUSBoQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*XI7j33ktxcDbdqlHiUSBoQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*XI7j33ktxcDbdqlHiUSBoQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>taken from the research paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf" rel="noopener">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf</a></figcaption></figure><p id="f694">Where <em>x_ne[v]</em> denotes the features of the neighbors of <em>v, x_co[v]</em> is the edge features connected to <em>v, h_ne[v] </em>is the embedding of the neighbors of v.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2184/1*ysh3sKgHjKAsPWaoX_TA7g.jpeg" width="1092" height="612" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ysh3sKgHjKAsPWaoX_TA7g.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ysh3sKgHjKAsPWaoX_TA7g.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ysh3sKgHjKAsPWaoX_TA7g.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ysh3sKgHjKAsPWaoX_TA7g.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ysh3sKgHjKAsPWaoX_TA7g.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/embeddings-www/files/nrltutorial-part2-gnns.pdf" rel="noopener">http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/embeddings-www/files/nrltutorial-part2-gnns.pdf</a></figcaption></figure><p id="21ec">In the above figure, hₐ⁽¹⁾ is the initial embedding of the node, hNₐ⁽¹⁾ is the aggregated embeddings of its neighbors. Combining these and passing to the node’s activation unit or filter will provide the new embedding for node A, which will also contain information about its neighbors. In this manner, each node gets a new set of embeddings for itself which determines its position in the graph. With various iterations or K layers of message passing, a node learns more and more about its neighborhood and its distant neighbors as well.</p><p id="34e2">Eventually, each node has a rough idea about the complete graph (or a part of it, depending on the number of iterations and node-node distance/path or layers considered).</p><p id="5d4b"><em>An example:</em> Consider a graph with social media posts as nodes. Now, if these nodes have embeddings and are labelled with tags like romance, science, comedy, etc., we get a new post and we need to provide it with a tag. Using the existing network and embeddings, neighborhood aggregation will help us predict the labels and embeddings for the unseen node.</p><p id="9d39"><strong>Advantage:</strong> Rather than running the entire algorithm again, we can just use embeddings of the neighbors to determine the locality of the new post. Therefore, GNN-based recommendation can be more efficient and scalable than other traditional machine learning recommendation algorithms out there for dealing large datasets.</p><p id="3b81">Graphs are used with various existing neural network architectures to yield promising results for various machine learning problems. The two most dominant networks are discussed briefly below.</p><h2 id="e7ab">Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)</h2><p id="9760">Convolutional neural networks(CNNs) have been vastly used for image classification and segmentation problems. Convolutional operation refers to applying a spatial filter to the input image and getting a feature map as a result.</p><p id="50dc"><em>You can read more about CNNs </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" rel="noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="0205">GCNs refer to applying a spatially moving filter over the nodes of the graph which contains embeddings or data relevant to each node to get a feature representation of each node. Stacking a number of convolutional layers like a regular CNN can also be done to incorporate information from larger neighborhoods.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*gzid1GA297zfpZm1IWIDOQ.png" width="1600" height="796" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*gzid1GA297zfpZm1IWIDOQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*gzid1GA297zfpZm1IWIDOQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*gzid1GA297zfpZm1IWIDOQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gzid1GA297zfpZm1IWIDOQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gzid1GA297zfpZm1IWIDOQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Image source: <a href="https://www.experoinc.com/post/node-classification-by-graph-convolutional-network" rel="noopener">https://www.experoinc.com/post/node-classification-by-graph-convolutional-network</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a5c8">Graph Auto-Encoder Networks</h2><p id="b199">Auto-encoders are neural networks which consist of two networks combined via a bottleneck layer: An encoder, which downsamples the input by passing it through convolutional filters to provide the compact feature representation of the image, and a decoder<strong> </strong>which takes the representation provided by the encoder as input and tries to re-construct the input according to the same.</p><p id="1547">You can read more about auto-encoders <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p id="2eed">Graph auto-encoders try to learn a compact representation of the graph and then re-construct the graph using the decoder.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
                        <p>I bought my first PC back in 1998 and started experimenting with web design a few years later. It was amazing how easily you could create web pages with rich content and navigate between them just like in interactive desktop apps. Let’s not talk about all those texture backgrounds along with animated gifs that no one could resist using. It was a playground and I loved it.</p>

<p>Microsoft Frontpage and Macromedia Dreamweaver (which was later acquired by Adobe) were the first tools I used to design and code websites just for the fun of it. At first, it was a more ‘what you see is what you get’ (WYSIWYG) approach but soon, I started playing more directly with HTML and CSS through Dreamweaver’s code editor.</p>

<p>A passion was born with various fun web projects being built on the side. I loved that aspect and while I was studying for my bachelor’s degree in Informatics, I got involved with all the web projects I could find. Those included web development and helped me improve my skills in those areas as well.</p>

<p>The idea that I might be able to work online from my home quickly became an obsession back then. In 2009, demand for web applications was rising, so I started experimenting with dashboard templates and eventually, 3 projects were created and released in the next 3 years.</p>

<p>I built them in my free time while I was working with a tech company on a few web apps and studying for my master’s degree at the same time. They did just ok but a whole new world was opened in front of me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the various responsibilities I had at the time, I kept postponing any further action but I eventually did a dynamic comeback in 2013 when I was ready to put all my energy into designing and coding dashboard templates full-time.</p>

<h3>Passionate with UI design</h3>

<p>You’ve heard before that you need to love your work if you would like to be successful but that’s only half the story. Loving what you do can motivate you, inspire you and make things a bit easier but that’s not necessarily enough in the long run.</p>

<p>I was and I am extremely passionate with UI design and coding. Back then, I used Photoshop to design each project and afterwards, I did my best to code it into HTML/CSS and make sure it works great in each major desktop and mobile browser. I used to spend so many hours testing and making sure that the result would be as perfect as possible based on my skills.</p>

<p>In 2013, I was able to build and release 3 more projects which were built with love and care. That’s also when the mottos “Crafted with love” and “Happy coding” came to life and follow pixelcave since then. The templates did good but unfortunately it was nothing sustainable.</p>

<p>I loved what I was doing and felt really good designing and coding but that on its own wasn’t enough. I needed to start thinking differently because if the whole plan didn’t work out, pixelcave most probably wouldn’t exist today.</p>

<h3>What people need</h3>

<p>I knew that I needed to deliver value to the people using those projects and save them time, so I had to do a far better job researching their needs before even start creating the next project, <a href="https://pixelcave.com/products/proui">ProUI</a>. It might seem obvious now but wasn’t the case back then.</p>

<p>I went through all the feedback (emails and comments) I had received from the first 3 projects and kept putting together a list of all the things people liked, struggled with, or wish they had. A few things on the list kept coming back, so I knew that those were crucial, and I had to prioritize them.</p>

<p>Next up, I researched public feedback regarding similar projects and got a feeling of what didn’t work and the problems most of the people were having when using such products. There were many issues that also kept coming back, so I’ve already had a good list of features and solutions that I had to work on ProUI.</p>

<p>What kept me researching for a while was the feeling that creating another project in the same way, would give me the same mediocre results. You can’t expect to have a different outcome when doing the same things repeatedly. I’m glad I’ve followed that path before getting my hands dirty and start coding the new template.</p>

<h3>Deliver under pressure</h3>

<p>This project was everything back then because its success or failure would completely change my life. If it didn’t work, it was the end of my working from home career and I had to completely change my approach and start looking for alternatives. There was no money or time to waste and for my mind, it was a matter of survival, I wanted it to succeed so much.</p>

<p>That was the perfect timing and the pressure helped me take it very seriously. I tried to be positive and passionate about the result and kept working day and night towards making a great product. It’s funny how pressure can help or harm your work. I have experienced both outcomes in the past but thankfully it was one of the things that pushed me forward, helped me overcome my fears and boosted my creativity. ProUI was live and the pressure had delivered. Sales started coming in, a new world appeared in front of my eyes and I knew that nothing was going to be the same again.</p>

<h3>Be original</h3>

<p>ProUI was designed and coded from scratch by hand. In contrary to the way other products were created by only using readymade layouts, navigation elements and other major building blocks, ProUI foundation was based on a solid structure built exclusively for it. I think that’s what gave it an identity in the first place and helped it in the long run.</p>

<p>I did my best to implement many popular features, provide solutions to issues people were experiencing, make a template that is straightforward, easy to use and most importantly that works as advertised. When inspiration hit, personal design touches were applied to make the design original and give it the feeling of a fresh experience.</p>

<h3>Test everything like crazy</h3>

<p>Testing was one of the main features of ProUI and continue being for all current projects. It might be simpler now with most popular browsers being chromium-based but that wasn’t the case back in the days. Internet Explorer 8 was the baseline and the newly introduced popularity of mobile browsers with their own set of issues wasn’t making things any better.</p>

<p>Responsive design was in its glory days and started becoming mainstream back in 2013 but testing tools weren’t on par yet. I still remembered resizing the browser like 1000 times each day to ensure that all content would appear as supposed to from mobile screens up to desktop monitors.</p>

<p>Testing on devices was also a big issue because I only had access to 2 older smartphones. New devices kept releasing at the time with various browsers popping up, so my solution was to visit stores for testing on their promo devices! I uploaded versions of the work-in-progress template to the demo server and tested it against various devices, from Macbooks to iPhones, iPads, and latest Android devices.</p>

<p>One of the main issues people were experiencing at the time was the poor mobile performance, so I was determined to make ProUI as fast and responsive as possible. During my visits, I kept notes and tried to fix the bugs when I got back home on the fly hoping that they will work. Of course, that wasn’t always the case, so visiting the stores became part of my weekly work schedule! I switched stores occasionally, so it doesn’t get too awkward...</p>

<p>Thankfully, the effort fulfilled its purpose and ProUI was released in a good stable state. I kept visiting the stores for a few months though (before I was able to get my hands on my own testing devices) to handle any reported bugs. My goal was to always reply in less than 24hrs during business days to support requests (something that I still do), so there were days of me rushing through stores to handle the situation. I tried to keep it cool with my responses despite the store situation (how professional is to test against demo devices in a store?) but in the end, I want to believe that the effort and care I gave, really paid off and helped ProUI be as bug free as possible.</p>

<h3>Balance time and delivery</h3>

<p>I learned that you must keep a balance between the features you want to implement in your project and the time it takes you to do it. It’s far better to integrate less and put your project out there sooner than trying to make it as complete as possible.</p>

<p>While building ProUI, bills kept coming in, which in the end I think helped me because I had to put it out there as quickly as possible. That might not made it the perfect release I might had in my mind but in the end, ProUI provided value and helped people in their projects.</p>

<h3>Not knowing stuff</h3>

<p>This is important and seems to apply in everything I do. As you learn more about your product’s market or about the tech you are using, it gets harder and harder to put something out there. You analyze everything way too much and easily spot the things that might go, or you do wrong.</p>

<p>There was this guy, who started selling WordPress plugins without knowing much about the market but focused on creating great products. After managing to reach 1 million in sales, he stated that if he knew the things he discovered afterwards, he would probably have never started selling WordPress plugins in the first place because it would be too difficult for him.</p>

<p>It was early days, and this is how I felt when I was building ProUI. It was liberating not analyzing what works and what doesn’t and focus on the product itself. Since then, I try to keep a balance between the things I discover and the things I want to experiment with when working on something. It’s exactly like the designer who redesigns his website and before he even finishes, he already finds the new design awful. Don’t be like that, try to fight back!</p>

<h3>Being perfect is subjective</h3>

<p>I would describe myself as perfectionist, but I try not to. Thankfully, the characterization does not apply, most of the time. When you are aiming for perfection, the only one you satisfy is yourself. You set the bar of perfection based on the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Autonomous Cars Industry defines <a href="https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/">6 levels of driverless vehicles</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>L0 - No automation</li>
<li>L1 - Driver Assistance</li>
<li>L2 - Partial Automation</li>
<li>L3 - Conditional Automation</li>
<li>L4 - High Automation</li>
<li>L5 - Full Automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the world of SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) has already adopted the term <code>Autonomous System</code> to refer to the
judicious application of automation, the word <code>Autonomous Security</code> is not widely used by the Security industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For SRE, automation is a force multiplier, not a panacea. Of course, just multiplying 
force does not naturally change the accuracy of where that force is applied: doing automation 
thoughtlessly can create as many problems as it solves. Therefore, while we believe that 
software-based automation is superior to manual operation in most circumstances, better 
than either option is a higher-level system design requiring neither of them—an autonomous system. 
Or to put it another way, the value of automation comes from both what it does and its 
judicious application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While no one will disagree that Security Automation is critical to scale security ops within any
organization. The size, diversity, and complexity in which we are operating make the current approach of having
humans and manual processes to address the volume vulnerabilities and incidents not so scalable. Scaling teams will
eventually be limited by how many people we can hire, scaling processes will eventually cripple an organization's
productivity.</p>
<p>The goal of <code>Autonomous Security</code> is to automate the decision process. In the context of vulnerability scanning, for instance, this
might take the form of <strong>quarantining a vulnerable machine, setting up a firewall rule or deploying a patch</strong>, in the 
context of incident response, this might take the form <strong>dumping memory for forensic analysis and reducing access to critical systems</strong>.</p>
<p>Achieving this high degree of automation cannot be done without effective technology and a feedback loop to measure what
works, what does not and detect what is missing.</p>
<p>The following article coins the term <code>Autonomous Security</code> in the context
of Security Scanning and outlines the required technological blocks and policies. The end goal is to automate
containment and use a feedback loop to address missing parts and blind spots.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="https://blog.ostorlab.co/static/img/autonomous.png" title="Autonomous Loop"></p>
<p>The document defines 5 tiers to reflect the different maturity levels. In the next sections, we will define each block
and how its maturity level can be enhanced while achieving the goal of a fully <code>Autonomous System</code>.</p>

<h3>1. Inventory &amp; Discovery</h3>
<p>Inventory consists of listing assets and collecting useful metadata like ownership, usage (Prod vs. Dev), and targeting information, for
instance listing all the desktop machines within your organization and collecting metadata like MAC address, IP address,
and employee owner.</p>
<p>Inventory is used for security scanning to schedules scans, assign vulnerabilities for fixes, present an aggregated
view of the security of an environment and drive strategic remediation.</p>
<p>Inventory is difficult to maintain when it is purely security focused and is better if it is not operated by the security
team. Inventory maintenance is challenge both; from a technical and a  process perspective. In most cases and environments <strong>we are
faced with the need to keep inventory of assets with different and contradicting requirements</strong>, such as highly
volatile vs. immutable assets, low volume with frequent changes vs. high volumes with rare changes, or 
ambiguous vs. hierarchical ownership. Hence, building and maintaining an infrastructure that copes with all of these requirements is a very challenging problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example scanning desktop machines vs. database servers, desktops routinely change IP addresses and have a single owner, while a database
server rarely changes an IP address, and the services they run; have separate owners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, Inventory can benefit a wide range of usages, like tracking consumption (financial), monitoring deployments (production),
hence, making it is easier to maintain if driven by production as it is usually the best way to keep it up to date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a case in point, the newly open-sourced project <code>Backstage</code> by Spotify <a href="https://github.com/spotify/backstage">Backstage</a>. According
to the team behind the project, because the <code>Backstage</code> provides the tools to create and monitor deployments, it has naturally became the source of
truth of their inventory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While an up-to-date inventory is ideal, it is practically not achievable due to blind spots caused by human interaction or technological limitations.</p>
<p>As it is taxing to determine blind spots, <strong>Inventory should always be augmented with an external discovery component</strong>
that tries to locate respective blind spots. Discovery should continuously attempt to find the loopholes that remain uncovered.</p>
<p>The discovery system is not limited to technical tools, like domain name brute forcing, but can also resort to other
means, like tracking payment done with enterprise credit card to find non listed cloud projects for instance.</p>
<h3>2. Scanning</h3>
<p>Scanning has 3 dimensions, namely scheduling, orchestration and detection that are as follows:</p>
<h4>2.1 Scheduling</h4>
<p>Scheduling addresses the question of when to scan; it is either time based or event based. Time-based like for instance once a day.
Event based like at each submit or every time a new container is created. The scheduling is driven by the asset lifetime and the vulnerability report lifetime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all assets are equal when it comes to scheduling, for instance scanning a public website requires a continuous
time based rules, while containers for instance require an event based to scan at creation and the detection of a new
CVE affecting one of the container dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Event-based scanning is always preferred over time based scans as we narrow the window of when things can get wrong.
It is unfortunately not always possible. Take for instance black box scanning of a website, without any measure of
how things are changing or evolving, the only option we have is a time-based approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current time-based approach can be drastically enhanced by avoiding full re-scans and building on previous scan results and coverage.
Take for instance scanning a website, instead of doing full crawl with every scan, scanner can use previous crawls to
speed up scans, detect changes and focus tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fully <code>Autonomous Security</code> pipeline doesn't need to hammer an asset with continuous scans, but can take a smarter
approach. If an asset is a static website and it hasn't changed in the last 6 months, the system should be able to
lower the frequency of scans.</p>
<h4>2.2 Orchestration</h4>
<p>Orchestration defines how to handle the lifecycle of a scan, like what to do in the case
of a failure, whom to notify during the different phases of a scan, should a set of extra
resolution steps or notification get triggered, should a duplicate dedicated environment get 
created for scanning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With service mesh type architecture (e.g. Istio), it is possible to create a <code>testing garden</code>
by duplicating a set of services for scanning, route scanning traffic to the new mesh based
on a header value for instance and apply quota to access shared components like a database or a message queue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Orchestration is typically critical for compliance regimes, like PCI-DSS or FedRamp. A fully <code>Autonomous Security</code> pipeline
can define a set a hooks to trigger business oriented logic, like notify certain people, update certain dashboards,
generate certain reports, etc.</p>
<h4>2.3 Detection</h4>
<p>Detection is usually what most people think of when we talk about security scanning. As important as it is, it is
only one cog in a large machinery.</p>
<p>Proper detection must reduces false positives and negatives and take context to rate severity. Finding the correct
balance the suits the size of an organization and the severity of an environment is an important balance.</p>
<p>Creating a map of the type of assets owned by an organization and creating a coverage map is helpful to identify
missing capabilities, an simplified map could be as simple as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>* Network</span><span>:</span>
    <span>* IPv4</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span> 
    <span>* IPv6</span><span>:</span> <span>MISSING</span>

<span>* Web</span><span>:</span>
    <span>* Known Vulnz</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span>
    <span>* non-SPA</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span>
    <span>* SPA</span><span>:</span> <span>MISSING</span>
    <span>* Authenticated</span><span>:</span> <span>MISSING</span>

<span>* Mobile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>* Android</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span>
    <span>* iOS</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span>
    <span>* Mobile Backend</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span>

<span>* Cloud</span><span>:</span>
    <span>* VM</span><span>:</span> <span>MISSING</span>
    <span>* Containers</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span>
    <span>* Serverless</span><span>:</span> <span>MISSING</span>

<span> </span><span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or as complex as :</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>* Web</span><span>:</span>
    <span>* SQL Injection</span><span>:</span>
      <span>* Postgrs</span><span>:</span>
        <span>* WHERE Clause</span><span>:</span> <span>CHECK</span>
        <span>* FROM Clause</span><span>:</span> <span>MISSING</span>
        <span>* ORDER Clause</span><span>:</span> <span>LIMITED</span>
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>While detection is a <strong>VERY</strong> large topic, a common complaint in this space is that security vendors often
over-promise and under-delivered space. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/10/23/cybersecurity-is-failing-due-to-ineffective-technology/">This is good resource on why the security industry is failing due to ineffective technology</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All security solutions can be split into 2 technological pieces, an <code>Analysis Engine</code> and set of <code>Rules</code>. The engine is typically
what takes a program, a website, an IP and performs a set transformations or interactions.</p>
<p>Example of <code>Analysis Engines</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency fingerprint engine</strong>: Find dependencies and 3rd party components.</li>
<li><strong>Taint Engine</strong>: Generate object-oriented graph taint to find link between sources and sinks.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Engine</strong>: Collect stack traces, methods and parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Fuzz Engine</strong>: Injects inputs and collects data flow and crash reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>The engine outputs are then …</p></div></div>

        <p>Travelling back in time to 2004, the “World Wide Web” was dominated by Microsoft, AOL, and Jeeves. (the)Facebook had just launched, and it would be three more years until the first iPhone. I was just fifteen, and didn’t have many friends. I did, however, have a keen interest in computers, and was blown away by the connectivity of the Internet. It wasn’t long before I started immersing myself in the coding languages that powered it -- building websites that I wanted to use, but didn’t yet exist.</p><p>I didn’t know it back then, but I was dipping my toes in the waters of <strong>product management</strong>, or <strong>product</strong> as it’s better known now.</p><p>Product essentially being the ability to work with a multidisciplinary team of people and build a simple solution to a real customer problem in a way that meets the needs of the business. All with an understanding of how design, business, technology and users intersect and overlap.</p><p>Back then product management was more associated with enterprise software, with Product Managers (PMs) being concentrated in the likes of Cisco and Oracle.</p><p>As Internet adoption exploded over the next decade and startups became part of everyday life, PMs were no longer building highly specialised or corporate software exclusively. They were the founders building stuff that helped with everything from dating through to grabbing a taxi. They were also building products in larger corporates; for example Gmail within Google.</p><p>The PM concept had hit the mainstream. </p><p>Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Tesla -- the list could go on -- have all successfully scoped out, built, and launched products that are used by billions of people. All because they have a solid product culture, that connects all the dots. It’s hard to imagine a modern-day tech company not having ‘product’ at their core.</p><p>With this context, I wanted to talk about the secrets that I’ve noticed in high performing product teams over the years. So whether you’re an early stage startup working on achieving product/market fit, or a growth stage company working on scale, or even a large corporate trying to regain your ability to consistently deliver new value to your customers, I’m sure that there will be something to takeaway.</p><h2 id="making-sure-the-basics-are-covered">Making sure the basics are covered </h2><p>Before jumping into the secrets, I want to make sure we’re on the same page with regard to the basics. Without these being covered no product team will be able to have consistent break-out success.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>def sum_product(n):

</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Distilling it down to first principles, I think ‘product’ is really about evaluating opportunities and determining what gets built and delivered to customers. Everything stems from this. And to do it successfully, you must:</p><ol><li>Understand your customer,</li><li>Understand the data, and</li><li>Understand your business and the industry it operates in</li></ol><p>Understanding the customer means you’re an expert on their issues, pains, desires, and how they think. Without this, you’re just guessing. And it has to be a mix of both quantitative and qualitative learning. </p><p>Understanding the data covers a wide gamut, not only the ability to understand your customer but to know what they’re doing with your product. Successful products need to be loved by your customers but also need to work for your business. This means knowing who your stakeholders are and the constraints they operate under.</p><p>Finally understanding your market. You need to know who your competitors are – in addition to key trends, customer behaviours and expectations.</p><p>Each of these principles deserves its own in-depth post – but, for now, I wanted to provide some brief context before touching on the lesser known secrets. </p><h2 id="first-you-need-a-big-mission">First, you need a big mission</h2><p>It’s critical for your team to be organised around something that’s motivating. </p><p>It has to be a mission that’s worthwhile. Something that gets them out of bed. But it also has to be somewhat ambiguous, or unattainable, as well. Think of Elon Musk’s mission for SpaceX – to colonise Mars. </p><p>This helps people become missionaries. It also helps align the skills of the people that are potentially going to be working on the product. Finally, it serves as a filter. A filter for people who are able to connect the dots, from the potentially mundane tasks of today to the exciting vision of tomorrow. These are the people that you want around you. Those who can’t connect the dots, will naturally fall by the wayside.</p><p>Next, even though the <em>mission</em> may sound crazy, this doesn’t mean the <em>vision</em> is.</p><p>The product vision has to be consumer centric yet aligned with the mission. The product team are usually the ones translating that mission into reality. And that’s what the vision helps you do. </p><p>Product are usually the ones initiating the conversation around what the product vision should be, because we’re the ones talking to the customer.</p><p>So an idea might be seeded by the founders or execs, hypothesising about an area of opportunity. But it’s only once you start interacting with the customer, that you can say, “Oh yeah, that’s a good idea” or, “No that’s an awful idea, let’s not do that.”</p><p>The product vision gives the organisation its purpose, and we only want people in our organisation that are excited about, and dedicated to this vision —missionaries. PM thought leader Marty Cagan describes this well:</p><blockquote>There are many benefits of product teams, but a big goal is captured best by a quote from John Doerr, the famous Silicon Valley venture capitalist: “we need a team of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.” Mercenaries build whatever they’re told to build. Missionaries are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their customers. <br></blockquote><h2 id="next-a-finger-on-the-pulse-of-innovation">Next, a finger on the pulse of innovation</h2><p>High performing product teams are always seeking improvement. They're open to adopting new methodologies (e.g. think Agile a few years ago) and implementing emerging technologies. They have a high risk tolerance, and love placing educated bets.</p><p>As an example, pretty much all the awesome product teams I know are currently, as I type this, immersing themselves in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They understand that AI is the next general purpose technology – something that will affect the world, and an opportunity that usually only comes along once in a generation. </p><p>These teams understand that scale economies accrue to first movers in AI, and second movers will find it difficult to catch up. By adopting early they reap the rewards of a positive feedback loop. They will capture early customers who, in turn, will create more data for the product. Resulting in a virtuous cycle that gives them a real, tangible and defensible advantage.</p><p>AI is transcending every industry. PMs used to be confined to just the tech sector, but the PMs of tomorrow will be needed in industries as diverse as farming and transportation; &nbsp;construction and medicine. Knowing how the AI product life cycle differs from that which has gone before will be a core competitive advantage.</p><p>An ingrained culture of continuous improvement and evolution is at the heart of every high performing team. The key is to be continuously scanning the market for trends and evolutions, not just in the markets for which you are building products, but in how and why.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-a-finite-game">It’s not a finite game</h2><p>Strong product teams don’t think in terms of a first or second half of the game – trying to get points on the board. But rather, they think of it as an infinite game. Always trying to get better. Understanding that there’s mastery beyond where they are, at every step.</p><p>This means they’re always going to beat their competition, because the competition is always going to be seeking this quarterly result, or that end event. Maybe ’the event’ is an IPO or an acquisition. Whereas the high performing team isn’t focussed on any particular business event, they’re seeking, “What’s the best possible outcome for this brand?”; “What’s the best possible outcome for this customer?”</p><p>This fundamentally changes the mentality of the team and the nature of how they show up every day. </p><p>It also relates to open mindedness – is your team open to new learning? Or do they assume they know everything?</p><p>The open mindset reminds your team of the idea that we’re not perfect, that we could fail, and that we may not have the answer. You need to have a culture where it’s okay to say “I don’t know” even when someone might expect you to.</p><h2 id="safe-psychological-spaces">Safe psychological spaces</h2><p>Do your team members feel like they can express an opinion or share what they think without feeling like they’re going to be repressed by your opinion, or that of the loudest person in the room? &nbsp;</p><p>Strong product teams don't look for consensus. They understand that innovation and collaboration are not correlated to consensus. </p><p>People should be encouraged to share their opinions. They can have disagreements about approaches but there needs to be an open forum where people have an opportunity to share. </p><p>A common problem is that people go to work and they don’t feel like they can express their opinions because they've got a structure, or a manager, or a situation that doesn’t allow for that to happen. </p><p>Safe psychological space is something that managers and leaders of high performing teams work a lot on. And it’s never over. You're always changing it because you're always bringing new people in. And every time you bring a new person in, you’ve got a change in dynamic. How do you make sure those people feel safe and that the people that who were previously interacting in a safe way don’t feel like they’re being adjusted in some way that’s negative.</p><h2 id="many-other-contributing-factors">Many other contributing factors</h2><p>The selection of secrets I’ve offered here are just a few of my favourites. </p><p>Others on the shortlist include:</p><ol><li>Empowerment and accountability -- ensuring that your team members are assigned problems to solve, rather than just given lists of …</li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>In this article, we will compare one apple (IntelliJ Rust) to one orange (rust-analyzer) to reach general and sweeping conclusions.
Specifically, I want to present a case study supporting the following claim:</p>
<p>For complex applications, Rust is as productive as Kotlin.</p>
<p>For me, this is an unusual claim to argue: I always thought exactly the opposite, but I am not so sure now.
I came to Rust from C++.
I was of the opinion that this is a brilliant low-level language and always felt puzzled at people writing higher-level things in Rust.
Clearly, choosing Rust means taking a productivity hit, and using Kotlin, C# or Go just makes much more sense if you can afford GC.
My <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">list of Rust criticisms</a> starts with this objection.</p>
<p>What moved my position in the other direction was my experience as the lead developer of rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust.
Let me introduce the two projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><strong>IntelliJ Rust</strong></a> is the plugin for IntelliJ Platform, providing Rust support.
In effect, it is a Rust compiler front-end, written in Kotlin and making use of language-support features of the platform.
These features include lossless syntax trees, a parser generator, persistence and indexing infrastructure, among others.
Nonetheless, as programming languages differ lot, the bulk of logic for analyzing Rust is implemented in the plugin itself.
Presentational features like completion list come from the platform, but most of the language semantics is hand-written.
IntelliJ Rust also includes a bit of a Swing GUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer"><strong>rust-analyzer</strong></a> is an implementation of
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Rust.
It is a Rust compiler front-end written from scratch with an eye towards IDE support.
It makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">salsa</a> library for incremental computations.
Beyond the compiler itself, rust-analyzer includes code for managing long-lived multithreaded process of the language server itself.</p>
<p>The projects are essentially equivalent in scope — rust compiler front-ends suitable for IDEs.
The two biggest differences are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IntelliJ Rust is a plugin, so it can re-use code and design patterns of the surrounding platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rust-analyzer is the second system, so it leverages experience of IntelliJ Rust for a from-scratch design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The internal architecture of the two projects also differs a lot.
In terms of <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">Three Architectures</a>, IntelliJ Rust is map-reduce, and rust-analyzer is query-based.</p>
<p>Writing an IDE-ready compiler is a high-level task.
You don’t need to talk to the operating system directly.
There are some fancy data structures and concurrency here and there, but they are also high-level.
It’s not about implementing crazy lock-free schemes, it’s about maintaining application state and sanity in the multithreaded world.
The bulk of the compiler is symbolic manipulation, arguably best suited for lisp.
Picking a VM-based language for such task (for example, OCaml), doesn’t have any intrinsic downsides.</p>
<p>At the same time, the task is pretty complex and unique.
The ratio of “your code” vs “framework code” when implementing features is much higher than in a typical CRUD backend.</p>
<p>Now that the projects are introduced, lets take two roughly equivalent slices of history.</p>

<p>Both are about 2 years old, with 1-1.5 developers working full time and vibrant and thriving community of open-source contributors.
There are 52k lines of Kotlin and 66k lines of Rust.</p>
<p>Both delivered roughly equivalent feature sets at that time.
To be honest, I still don’t really believe this :)
rust-analyzer started from zero, it didn’t have a decade worth of Java classes to bootstrap from, and the productivity drop between Kotlin and Rust is supposed to be huge.
But it’s hard to argue with reality.
Instead, let me try to reflect on my experience building both, and to try to explain Rust’s surprising productivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_learning_curve">Learning Curve</h2>
<div>
<p>It’s easy to characterize Kotlin’s learning curve — it is nearly zero.
I’ve started IntelliJ Rust without Kotlin experience and never felt that I need to specifically learn Kotlin.</p>
<p>When I switched to rust-analyzer, I was pretty experienced with Rust.
I would say that one definitely needs to deliberately learn Rust, it’s hard to pick it up on the go.
Ownership and aliasing control are novel concepts (even if you come from C++), and taking holistic approach to learning them pays off.
After the initial learning step the ride is generally smooth.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the perfect place to plug our Rust courses and tailor-made <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/">trainings</a> :-)
The next <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/#package-intro-training">introduction to Rust</a> is happening this December!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_modularity">Modularity</h2>
<div>
<p>This I think is the biggest factor.
Both projects are moderately large in terms of scope as well as in terms of amount of source code.
I believe that the only way to ship big things is to split them in independent-ish chunks and implement the chunks separately.</p>
<p>I also find most of the languages I am familiar with to be pretty horrible with respect to modularity.
More generally, I am amused with FP vs OO debate, as it seems that “why no one does modules right?” is a more salient issue.</p>
<p>Rust is one of the few languages which has first-class concept of libraries.
Rust code is organized on two levels:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as a tree of inter-dependent modules inside a crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as a directed acyclic graph of crates</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Cyclic dependencies are allowed between the modules, but not between the crates.
Crates are units of reuse and privacy: only crate’s public API matters, and it is crystal clear what crate’s public API is.
Moreover, crates are anonymous, so you don’t get name conflicts and dependency hell when mixing several versions of the same crate in a single crate graph.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to make two pieces of code <strong>not</strong> depend on each other (non-dependencies are the essence of modularity): just put them in separate crates.
During code review, only changes to Cargo.tomls need to be monitored carefully.</p>
<p>At the time of comparison, rust-analyzer is split into 23 internal crates, with a handful general-purposed ones released on crates.io.
In contrast, IntelliJ Rust is a single Kotlin module, where everything can depend on everything else.
Although internal organization of IntelliJ Rust is pretty clean, it’s not reflected in the file system layout and build system, and needs constant maintenance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_build_system">Build System</h2>
<div>
<p>Managing project’s build takes significant amount of times, and has multiplicative effect on everything else.</p>
<p>Rust’s build system, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a>, is very good.
It’s not perfect, but it is a breath of fresh air after Java’s <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo’s trick is that it doesn’t try to be a general purpose build system.
It can only build Rust projects, and it has rigid expectation about the project structure.
It’s impossible to opt out of the core assumptions.
Configuration is a static non-extensible TOML file.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gradle allows free-form project structure, and is configured via a Turing complete language.
I feel like I’ve spend more time learning Gradle than learning Rust!
Running <code>wc -w</code> gives 182_817 words for Rust book, and 280_506 for Gradle’s user guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cargo is just faster than Gradle in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest downside is that custom build logic is not expressible in Cargo.
Both projects needs substantial amount of logic beyond mere compilation to deliver the final result to the user.
For rust-analyzer, this is handled by hand-written Rust script, which works perfectly at this scale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<div>
<p>Language-level support for libraries and top-notch build system/package manager allow for a thriving ecosystem.
rust-analyzer relies on third-party libraries much more than IntelliJ Rust.
Some parts of rust-analyzer are also published to crates.io for other projects to reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-level nature of the Rust programming language often allows for “perfect” library interfaces.
Interfaces which exactly reflect the underlying problem, without imposing intermediate language-level abstractions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_basic_conveniences">Basic Conveniences</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel that Rust is significantly more productive when it comes to basic language nuts and bolts — structs, enums, functions, etc.
This is not specific to Rust — any ML-family language has them.
However, Rust is the first industrial language which wraps these features in a nice package, not constrained by backwards compatibility.
I want to list specific features which I think allow producing maintainable code faster in Rust</p>
<p><em>Emphasis on data over behavior</em>.
Aka, Rust is not an OOP language.
The core idea of OOP is that of dynamic dispatch — which code is invoked by a function call is decided at runtime (late binding).
This is a powerful pattern which allows for flexible and extensible system.
The problem is, extensibility is costly!
It’s better only to apply it in certain designated areas.
Designing for extensibility by default is not cost effective.
Rust puts static dispatch front and center: it is mostly clear whats going on by just reading the code, as it is independent of runtime types of the objects.</p>
<p>One small syntactic thing I enjoy about Rust is how it puts fields and methods into different blocks syntactically:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>first_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
  <span>last_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>full_name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Being able to see at a glance all the fields makes understanding the code much simpler.
Fields convey much more information than methods.</p>
<p><em>Sum types</em>.
Rust’s humbly named enums are full algebraic data types.
This means that you can express the idea of disjoint union:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>),</span> <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is hugely useful in day-to-day programming in the small, and some times during programming in the large as well.
To give one example, one of the core concepts for an IDE are references and definitions.
A definition a like <code>let foo = 92;</code> assigns a name to an entity which can be used down a line.
A reference like <code>foo + 90</code> <em>refers</em> to some definition.
When you ctrl-click on reference, you go to the definition.</p>
<p>Natural way to model that in Kotlin is by adding <code>interface Definition</code> and <code>interface Reference</code>.
The problem is, some things are …</p></div></div></div></div>

			<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Stories and takeaways from growing ProveSource from 0 to $700k ARR as a 2-person team in less than 3 years and with no funding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png" alt="3 year story provesource" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<h2><strong>Our false start</strong></h2>
<p>We started the company in June 2015 with no real idea.</p>
<p>Most people we know fail to ever get started because they’re looking for the perfect idea.</p>
<p>As the founder of Instagram famously said:</p>
<p>“It’s about going through false starts. The best companies in the world have all had predecessors. YouTube was a dating site. You always have to evolve into something else.”</p>
<p>We brainstormed for several days and because both myself and Natan (my co-founder) are very good with mobile app development (iOS &amp; Android) we decided to build a personalization platform for mobile apps and sell it to enterprises.</p>
<p>Around 2.5 years later, having invested almost $100k out of our own pockets, having done hundreds of calls and demos with huge enterprises and dozens of Proof of Concepts, we decided it’s time to move on…</p>
<p>It felt awful – like you’re killing something you love, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>That was our “false start”. But more on that another time.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>The sooner you kill an idea that is getting no traction, even if it’s super hard because it’s your baby, the less painful it is. The more time and resources you devote, the harder it becomes to pull out in case things don’t work out.</p>
<h2><strong>Starting over – The lean way</strong></h2>
<p>In January 2018 we decided to start working on a new SaaS product.</p>
<p>The idea was to “steal” the social proof hack that Booking.com was using (e.g. 5 people booked this hotel, etc.) and create a platform from it – a social proof marketing platform.</p>
<p>This time, because we were running on fumes, both in terms of cash and motivation, we decided to validate the idea first.</p>
<p>We had a single purpose in mind – getting 100 leads interested in our product.</p>
<p>We created a landing page that showcased our new idea as a real product, including pricing, a signup button, and all – a social proof marketing platform for mobile apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p>The fastest way to get targeted traffic to your website is to use Google Ads targeting the brand names of the biggest players in your niche.</p>
<p>So we did that.</p>
<p>We also posted the landing page anywhere we could think of: Reddit, ProductHunt, BetaList, social media, wherever…</p>
<p>About one month and – $300 later, we had around 200 leads that wanted to try out ProveSource.</p>
<p>We were finally making progress!</p>
<p>We figured that even if only 1% of them converted, we would already have 2 paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>You can easily get traction without having a product.</p>
<p>Just buy a domain, build a landing page, and go validate your business idea.</p>
<p>We usually create landing pages to validate products using plain HTML and Airtable, to send the leads we collect from the forms. No fancy designs, no expensive CRM.</p>
<h2><strong>Making our first dollar $</strong></h2>
<p>Next goal – how do we make a dollar?</p>
<p>That is, unlike our previous product which made practically $0 in 2.5 years.</p>
<p>We created a rule that whenever we launch a new product, all our efforts will be towards making our first dollar, so we can have real-life validation.</p>
<p>So we have 200 people interested in ProveSource.</p>
<p>Now we needed to give them a product and get them to pay.</p>
<p>We built the leanest MVP possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product just for website owners (mobile was too small of a niche).</li>
<li>You could only show how many page visitors you had on your website.</li>
<li>The whole UI and UX should be super simple. No menus and extra buttons, don’t give users a reason to abandon your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you forget your password and need to reset it? Sorry, no can do.</p>
<p>Did we accidentally change your password when you logged in? Oops, we’re on it.</p>
<p>What are onboarding and email automation? Dunno, don’t care.</p>
<p>April 2018 – we are approached by a Facebook Group admin that is interested in promoting our product to his group as a “lifetime deal” (LTD).</p>
<p>This means selling a lifetime subscription to your product for a one-off payment ranging from $39-$99.</p>
<p>We’ve never heard of this before so we thought long and hard about the consequences of selling a lifetime deal and how it would position the product and our company…</p>
<p>We decided to go with the deal and ran it with the group for 1 week.</p>
<p>We generated over $7k revenue, got tons of feedback, ideas for product improvements, tons of bugs were discovered in the process, which taught us the value of having live chat support.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>In hindsight, there were no real consequences, only advantages to running a lifetime deal.</p>
<p>Sure, you have a few dozens of customers that are not paying you on a recurring basis – but they help a lot in the beginning when you need the cash and the validation.</p>
<p>Once we were done with the LTD we started pushing the product in all marketing channels and to our 200 user waiting list. None of them converted by the way.</p>
<p>A couple of days later we got our first monthly subscription customer ($19/month).</p>
<p>It was an amazing moment, validating that you indeed have a real business opportunity in your hands.</p>
<h2><strong>Our “wow moment”</strong></h2>
<p>During the next months, we focused on spreading the word, squashing bugs, and doing tons of support for our existing customers.</p>
<p>How did we decide what to build next?</p>
<ul>
<li>We learned to ask questions about our product’s value. Why do people buy our product? Is it because they want to increase conversions? How do we help them achieve that?</li>
<li>We brainstormed about what it means to be a social proof platform.</li>
<li>We heard our customers’ feedback</li>
<li>We learned from competitors; but not too much. We found that those who only copy will always lag behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process has to be accompanied by analytics and metrics.</p>
<p>You don’t have to measure each and every step or A/B test you do, though.</p>
<p>We don’t really do it, to this day.</p>
<p>A lot of product leaders talk about the “wow effect” or “wow moment” – if you want to retain users, make them say “wow”.</p>
<p>For Facebook, for example, their “wow moment” is logging into their platform and seeing familiar faces. That’s why they make sure that during sign up, you connect with as many people you know on Facebook as possible.</p>
<p>In our case, we focused on improving our user onboarding.</p>
<p>Since the product requires users to install a javascript snippet on their website, we put a big emphasis on making that process as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Our thought was – if users can see a social proof notification on their website, they’ll get to that “wow moment”.</p>
<p>We can see a very close correlation between successful onboarding and someone becoming a paying customer.</p>
<p>The funnel looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-10% of visitors will signup.</li>
<li>70% of those signups will complete the onboarding.</li>
<li>7-10% of those users who are onboarded will eventually become paying customers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>Find what your “wow moment” is in your users’ experience, and make sure you get users to experience it as early in the onboarding process as possible. That way you can spend a lot on User Acquisition activities because the users you bring in end up becoming paying customers and sticking with you.</p>
<h2><strong>Our First Growth “Hack”</strong></h2>
<p>After we added some “necessary” features like showing recent sales and polishing the product to have fewer bugs – we wanted to grow bigger, we wanted to scale up, we wanted to get more exposure.</p>
<p>How do you scale a notifications product that is essentially an add-on for websites?</p>
<p>You build integrations for all website builders.</p>
<p>So we worked hard on adding more and more integrations: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/provesource/">WordPress plugin</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/provesource">Shopify app</a>, Magento plugin, Wix app, <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/provesource/integrations">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/provesource-social-proof/">BigCommerce</a>, and more.</p>
<p>All of these marketplaces and app stores proved to be really good traffic sources and traction channels for us, each with its own audience and unique requirements.</p>
<p>Today, around 20% of our customers and revenue comes from Shopify alone.</p>
<h2><strong>Scaling past 2 people</strong></h2>
<p>Being a two-person team that does development, marketing, support, accounting, and more is tough. But it also teaches you a lot, you learn so much about your business, your audience, and your customers.</p>
<p>And that gives you the experience you need on what to look for when hiring someone to take over some of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>In September 2019 we decided it’s time to scale the team.</p>
<p>After all, a great company can’t be just 2 people, right?</p>
<p>Naturally, a software company’s first hire would be a developer.</p>
<p>Bringing Dima to the team, allowed us to build more integrations faster, and scale the company beyond its initial stage.</p>
<p>So we now have tons of integrations, pretty much with any large marketing or website platform out there.</p>
<p>We also scaled and optimized our Google and Facebook ads as much as we could.</p>
<p>We optimized our product onboarding rate, increased prices, added great features, and made it even easier to use the product, by adding tooltips, auto-suggestions, wizards, and more.</p>
<p>We were growing at a steady rate, so what could possibly be bothering us?</p>
<p>Well, we didn’t know how to grow faster, or what to do next.</p>
<p>We came up with a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a Growth team member to scale our marketing efforts and bring new ideas to the table.</li>
<li>Since our product offering is strong and we couldn’t think about any impactful feature we could develop – we thought about zooming out of our product’s initial market.</li>
<li>Build a new product – we have no investors so we are free to make any decision we want about the company’s direction. Investors often block the founders from doing whatever is best for the company and push for a point where they can exit.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Building a new product</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, we decided to build another product to scale the company further.</p>
<p>We had these questions in mind before picking what to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big is the market, is it potentially bigger than our current product?</li>
<li>Would our existing customers be customers of this new product too?</li>
<li>What do our existing customers need and are willing to pay for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding ProveSource to your website is great, but, there is a critical prerequisite to making it work for you and your website: traffic. If your website has no traffic, you won’t be able to generate social proof.</p>
<p>Here’s the …</p></div></div>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>“T</span>he Democratic Party,” wrote the late Walter Laqueur, was “liberal and slightly left-of-centre in outlook, progressive but not too much so, in favour of reform but afraid of going too far. . . . They had quite a few professors among their leading supporters and also some bankers and industrialists, but for the majority of academics . . . [it] was quite unacceptable.” Bourgeois parties “are never militant, almost by definition”—and the “Democratic Party was perhaps the least militant of all.”</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Central to its impotence, Laqueur believed, was “the mood of an activist younger generation.” An “unthinking, aimless radicalism,” which “preferred drums to speeches and parades to long and inconclusive discussions,” could “turn left or right or lead nowhere at all.” Not just on college campuses: “Contempt for ‘the system,’” its “vested interests, cliques, and party caucuses,” permeated the middle class. Leftists “attacked the Republic and all it stood for as something that was rotten through and through,” while conservatives thought “‘the system’ so corrupt that any political order that succeeded it would be an improvement”—even as they complained (correctly) that “the left was anti-patriotic.” Both sides “were unhappy, though for different reasons, with . . . the existing state of affairs.” “There was not the slightest willingness to take each other’s point of view seriously, let alone to compromise.” </p><p>That, at any rate, is how Laqueur saw Weimar Germany with the benefit of hindsight.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>A</span>merica is not Weimar. We have not lost a World War or been forced to pay war debt; we’ve had 250 years of democracy, not 25; Trump isn’t Hitler, and Biden, whatever his faults, isn’t calling for communism. There is street violence, but a lot less of it—for unlike Weimar, we do not generally let paramilitary groups supplant the police, Seattle’s “autonomous zone” being the exception that proves the rule.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But the exceptions are mounting. In Portland, protestors <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/protesters-attempt-create-autonomous-zone-portland-graffiti-smoke-pigs-precinct-1513743">attempted to create</a> an autonomous zone of their own by barricading the area with stolen property and blocking the exits of a nearby police precinct; “going to burn the building down,” one man threatened. In Minneapolis, a precinct actually did burn down after it was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/protests-looting-erupt-again-minneapolis-area-following-death-george-floyd-n1216881">set ablaze</a> by “demonstrators,” two of whom (<a href="https://www.startribune.com/charges-minneapolis-brothers-destroyed-property-inside-third-precinct/571450752/">both white</a>) were subsequently charged. In Kenosha, riots claimed two lives and several more city blocks, which <a href="https://twitter.com/joshglancy/status/1299734436792197120">were</a> “indistinguishable from a war zone” by the time the dust settled. </p><p>And throughout the country, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/nyregion/nyc-shootings-surge.html">New York City</a> to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-six-month-crime-stats-20200626-wqsf3rebavaldex7v54ozqsnxe-story.html">Chicago</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/davon-mcneal-shot/2020/07/05/16390c1a-bec6-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html">Washington, DC</a>, shootings have surged alongside looting—in some places, <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/nypd-shootings-increase-1.46044819">by over 400 percent</a>—destroying lives and livelihoods in their wake.</p><p>On its own, this would hardly warrant comparison with Weimar. Crime and violence are as American as apple pie, and street fighting, though aesthetically German, has plenty of precedent in the U.S. What recalls interwar Germany is not the chaos itself, but the way it has been excused, even encouraged, by those notionally in a position to stop it—many of whom seem ambivalent about whether the republic it threatens deserves defense. Examples of this excuse-making include, but are not limited to:</p><ol><li>The true <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/07/the-ugly-truth-about-the-blm-protests/">but trivial claim</a> that the protests have been “mostly” peaceful.</li><li>The argument, made by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/03/of-course-destruction-of-property-is-violence-299759">Pulitzer-winning <em>New York Times</em> journalist</a>, that “destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.”</li><li>A <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/in-defense-of-looting/">widely-circulated essay</a>, written during the Ferguson protests of 2014, that defends looting as a “righteous,” attention-grabbing tactic in the fight against white supremacy. (The author subsequently elaborated her arguments in a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/08/27/906642178/one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting">controversial interview</a> with NPR.)</li></ol><p>It is telling that, despite reaching the same conclusion, these excuses all contradict one another. If violence were extraordinarily rare (1), there would be no reason to deny its status <em>as</em> violence (2), or to defend its tactical value (3)—whereas if looting <em>weren’t</em> violent, if it didn’t disrupt or endanger life, its attention-grabbing power would be extraordinarily diminished. The contradictions suggest that elite alegality isn’t rooted in any specific principle, but rather a kind of inchoate radicalism: a vague, burn-it-down impulse increasingly common across the political spectrum, whose ends are drifting farther and farther apart. If the 2016 election <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210500/diagnosed-dysfunction-republican-party">seemed to confirm</a> the existence of “asymmetric” polarization, the 2020 tumult suggests that polarization can only remain asymmetric for so long. </p><p>And as the symmetries grow more apparent, the shadow of Weimar grows longer still. Much has been made—<a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/11/12/resilient-democracies/">too much</a>—of what are ultimately very weak parallels between Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. But though<strong> </strong>Trump’s America looks nothing like Nazi Germany, it <em>has </em>developed echoes of the Republic from which Nazism arose—echoes that implicate the left no less than the right. Weimar was not, as is sometimes suggested, a good society beset by bigots and bad luck. It was a febrile, dysfunctional culture in which few voters, and even fewer elites, believed in the Republic they eventually dissolved. We often hear about the perils of “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/trump-impeachment-journalism/">bothsidesism</a>,” of treating “fascists” and “anti-fascists” as equivalent threats. Yet in the collapse of Weimar Germany, both sides played an important role.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>T</span>o be fair, Weimar didn’t have a whole lot to work with. One of the things it did not have—or rather had stolen—was a well-defined founding. Officially, it began outside the German Reichstag on November 9, 1918, where the Social Democratic minister Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the birth of the Republic. But unofficially, it began at Hohenzollern Palace two hours later, when the communist leader Karl Liebknecht proclaimed a Republic of his own—the first of many such putsches by Germany’s leftmost wing. The repeated attempts to overthrow the government, and the fact that the Social Democrats, like the communists, claimed to be committed Marxists, made it easy for the right to blame instability on the left, and for the masses to associate that instability with Weimar's socialist architects.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But many republics, including ours, had violent foundings. What made Weimar special, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weimar-Republic-Crisis-Classical-Modernity/dp/0809015560">historian Detlev Peukert put it</a>, was that it “was not marked by an event that served as an old-fashioned but politically unifying . . . moment in national history, along the lines of the American Declaration of Independence.” It had two competing proclamations, two rival origin stories, which meant that there was “no legitimizing founding ritual” to sustain “active commitment to the new order.” Germans did, of course, debate which story was the true one. That it was debated at all both signaled and intensified a profound lack of legitimacy, an open wound ripe for infection. </p><p>These disagreements—less about facts than about symbolism—did not mean collapse was inevitable. (Weimar survived the 1920s, after all.) But they did mean that there were few common reference points to rein in polarization, and more chances for insurgent ideologies—never mind actual insurgents—to gain steam. </p><p>Weimar had no shortage of radicals; centrists, on the other hand, were a dying breed. The intelligentsia fell roughly into one of two camps: leftists who hated everything about Germany, from its culture to its constitution; and rightists who hated the constitution because it was insufficiently German—which is to say, insufficiently authoritarian. The last group dominated the universities, whose reliance on public funds did not dampen their rancor toward the Republic. In fairness, those funds hadn’t stopped the academic job market from cratering after WWI, which meant that even the best-credentialed thinkers were often precariously employed. With few prospects in the existing system, the intellectual class saw little reason to defend it, and had an easy time rationalizing its destruction. The upshot was that college-educated civil servants typically hated the Republic they were serving, as did judges, policymakers, and educators. Ditto artists, journalists, and playwrights, though these professions skewed left. </p><p>Beyond their shared anti-Republicanism, all that the two sides had in common was their contempt for one another. The left derided the right as backwards-looking and chauvinistic, while the right derided the left as self-hating and unpatriotic—all of which, it must be said, was true. Kurt Tucholsky, Weimar’s leading leftwing satirist, complained that “the German spirit was poisoned almost beyond recovery,” and that “German democracy [was] a facade and a lie.” “There is no secret of the Germany army I would not hand over readily to a foreign power,” he bragged in 1931, a boast that did not exactly endear him to the people who took power in ‘33. Those people, of course, were just as Tucholsky described them: irredeemable, backwards bigots whose deaths could not come soon enough.</p><p>But the Nazis never won more than a plurality of the vote—and most conservative elites were not Nazis. (Indeed, several became their victims.) What united the right was not a particular political program, but a general sense of grievance against the far left and republican center, distinct groups it would often synonymize. Marxism, modernism, liberalism—these were all shades of the same thing, corruptions of the old order. An equal but opposite elision occured on the left, with the communists calling everyone to their right—including the Social Democrats—fascists, an unfair charge that many leftwing intellectuals nonetheless echoed. The result of these stereo-stereotypes was threefold.</p><p>First, they exacerbated Weimar’s crisis of legitimacy. If the Republic lacked a founding ritual, the elites were in no hurry to invent one; rather, the “center” was so widely anathematized that it effectively didn’t exist. In one case, <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/communists-allied-with-nazis.html">the communists even endorsed a Nazi referendum</a> to overthrow the Social Democratic government in Prussia, on the theory that social democracy was a greater threat than National Socialism.

<div><p>In this multi-part tutorial I'm going to show you how you can use cheap and "low end" hardware to build an amazing router with firewalling capabilities, DNS, DHCP and much much more, using the fantastic OpenBSD operating system. I am going to use a setup in which the router segments the local area network (LAN) into separate networks, one for the grown-ups in the house, one for the children, and one for public facing servers, such as a private web server or mail server. I'll also show you how you can use DNS to effectively block out most ads, porn, and many harmful websites on the Internet. Last, but not least, I'll show you how you can use the firewall and DNS to block outgoing telemetric data from computers running Microsoft Windows, NVIDIA graphics drivers, etc. The router can also be used on small to mid-size offices.</p><p>If you don't need a segmented network, but simply need a solid firewall and/or DNS server, you can still use the tutorial as I am going to guide you step by step introducing and setting up one solution at a time.</p></div>

</ul>

<h2 id="why-a-firewall">Why a firewall?</h2>
<p>Almost no matter how you connect to the Internet from your home or office you need a real firewall between you and the modem or router that your ISP has provided you with.</p>
<p>I have worked in the ISP business and one thing I have noticed is that not only do they rarely keep your modem or router firmware up to date, they almost always use some of the cheapest and worst products on the market.</p>
<p>One of the sources for most of the SPAM email on the Internet originates from consumer market modems and routers that has been compromised.</p>
<p>With a firewall between you and the Internet, meaning the modem or router from your ISP, you can not only protect your computers on the inside much better, but you can also monitor the traffic that comes and goes to and from your house, and you can react to situations that might call for an alarm.</p>
<p>Without a firewall between your local network and the ISP modem or router you could basically consider this an open door policy, like leaving the door to your house wide open, because you cannot trust the equipment from your ISP.</p>
<p>At one particular ISP I even witnessed how some employees used to hack into customers computers. Of course the ISP didn't know that at the time.</p>
<p>No matter what, it is always a really good idea to put a real firewall between your local network and the Internet, and with OpenBSD you get an extremely solid solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>You don't have to buy expensive hardware to get an effective router and firewall for your house or office. Even with cheap and "low end" hardware you can get a very solid solution.</p>
<p>I have build multiple setups using the <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Q1900DC-ITX/">ASRock Q1900DC-ITX</a> motherboard that comes with an Intel Quad-Core Celeron processor.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/asrock-q1900dc-itx.png" alt="ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard"></p>
<p>I'll admit, it's a pretty "crappy" motherboard, but it gets the job done and I have several builds that have run very solid for many years on gigabit networks with full saturation and the firewall, DNS, etc. working "overtime" and the CPU hardly breaks a sweat. This is contrary to the expensive Soekris, which people used to recommend, that typically ran less powerful Intel Atom processors.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard has the advantage that it comes with a DC-In Jack that is compatible with a 9~19V power adapter, making it very power saving. Unfortunatly the ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard is no longer sold, but I'm just using it as an example because I have used several other cheap boards as well.</p>
<p>I have also used the ASRock Q1900-ITX (it doesn't come with the DC-In Jack) combined with a PicoPSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/picopsu.png" alt="PicoPSU power supply"></p>
<p>You can find different brands and versions of the PicoPSU, some are better quality than others. I have two different brands, the original and a cheaper knockoff, both performing very well and they save quite a bit of power contrary to running with a normal power supply that typically drains at least 10 watts more.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am using a cheap Intel knockoff quad port NIC found on Ebay like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/intel-quad-nic.png" alt="Intel Quad NIC"></p>
<p>Now before you start condemning me for using low end hardware, I know it is better to use quality hardware, especially on a network that you care about, but this tutorial is about how you can get away with using fairly cheep hardware and still get an extremely useful product that will continue to serve you well for many years - at least that is my experience.</p>
<p>I recommend that you look for a low power mini ITX board with hardware <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">supported by OpenBSD</a> such as an Intel Celeron or Intel i3 processor. These boards are typically cheap, less power hungry, and they don't take up very much space. I don't recommend using the Intel Atom CPU if you have a gigabit network as they usually choke because they can't handle the amount of traffic, but your milage may vary. Also, I have never had any luck finding any useful AMD boards because the CPU usually would require much more power than the Intel counterpart - however my experience with AMD is not up to date any longer. I also don't recommend older dual core Intel CPU's, they will work perfectly, but they also require more power.</p>
<p>Oh, and then you need a couple of cheap gigabit switches too for the segmented LANs, at least if you have more than one computer you want to connect to the same LAN :)</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>
<p>A router is basically a device that regulate network traffic between two or more separate networks. The router will ensure that network traffic intended for the local network doesn't run out into the wild on the Internet and traffic on the Internet, that is not intended for your local network, stays on the Internet.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Just for information, a router is sometimes also referred to as a gateway, which generally is alright, but in truth a real gateway joins dissimilar systems. An example of a gateway would be a device that joins a PC network with a  telecommunications network.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we're building a router and we have 4 different but similar networks to work with. One is the Internet and the other three are the internally segmented LANs. Some people prefer to work with virtual LANs, but in this tutorial I'm going to use the quad port NIC from above. You can achieve the same result by using multiple one port NICs if you prefer that, you just have to make sure that you have enough room and free PCI slots on the motherboard. You can also use the Ethernet port on the motherboard itself, but it depends on the driver and support for the device. I have had no problems using the typical Realtek PCI gigabit Ethernet controller that normally comes with many motherboards even though I recommend Intel over Realtek.</p>
<p>Of course you don't need to segment the network into several parts if you don't need that, and it will be very easy to change the things I setup in this tutorial, but I have decided to use this approach in order to show you how you can protect your children by segmenting their network into a separate LAN that not only gets ad and porn blocking using DNS blocking (all the segments gets that), but you can even whitelist the parts of the Internet you want them to have access to. The last part about whitelisting is difficult and generally not recommended unless your children only requires very limited access, but it is doable with some work, and I'm going to show you one way you can do that in part 3 of the tutorial.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the network we're going to setup:</p>
<pre><code>
                       Internet
                          |
                    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
                    ISP Modem (WAN)
                      10.24.0.23
                          |
                       OpenBSD
                      10.24.0.50
                  (router/firewall)
                          |
     -------------------------------------------
     |                    |                    |
    NIC1                 NIC2                 NIC3
192.168.1.1          192.168.2.1          192.168.3.1
LAN1 switch          LAN2 switch          LAN3 switch
     |                    |                    |
     -- 192.168.1.2       -- 192.168.2.2       -- 192.168.3.2
     |  Grown-up PC       |  Child PC1         |  Public web server
                          |
                          -- 192.168.2.3
                          |  Child PC2
</code></pre>
<p>The IP addresses that begins with 10 are whatever IP addresses your ISP router gives you, in my case it looks similar to the above. The IP addresses beginning with 192 are IP addresses that we're going to use in our local network.</p>
<p>I have not dealt with any kind of wireless connectivity in this setup. Wireless chip firmware is notoriously buggy and exploitable and I recommend you don't use any kind of wireless connections if you can do without. If you do require wireless connections I strongly recommend that you disable wireless access completely from the ISP modem or router (if possible), and then buy the best wireless router you can find and put it behind the firewall in an isolated segment instead. That way should your wireless device ever be compromised you can better control the outcome and limit the damage. You can further setup the wireless router such that any devices connected to it have their own IPs that pass directly through the wireless router, but at the same time block traffic directly originating from the wireless router itself. That way you can prevent the wireless router from "phoning home". You can also get a wireless adapter supported by OpenBSD and have your OpenBSD router run as the actual access point, however I much prefer to segment the wireless part to either a separate wireless router or another OpenBSD machine serving as a wireless access point behind the firewall itself. Also, as of writing (as far as I know) none of the OpenBSD wireless drivers are fully without problems.</p>

<h2 id="why-openbsd">Why OpenBSD?</h2>
<p>In truth, you can get a similar setup to the above running almost any kind of Linux flavor, but OpenBSD is specifically very well suited and designed for …</p></article></div>

<p>Many applications can be updated automatically and without any user interaction. This is commonly considered a good practice from the security point of view, since it allows for quick distribution of patches for critical vulnerabilities. However, automatic updates also carry an additional risk because they allow the software developers to push arbitrary code to users’ machines. Unfortunately, users often have no choice but to trust the developers that they will only use the update channel for its intended purpose and that they will protect it from malicious third parties.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll show that this trust might sometimes be misplaced. Specifically, we’ll show how one torrent client and three adblockers surreptitiously installed the FakeMBAM backdoor through automatic updates. We reverse engineered this backdoor and describe its inner workings in the second part of this post.</p>



<h2>An unexpected infection vector</h2>



<p>We recently <a href="https://blog.avast.com/fake-malwarebytes-installation-files-distributing-coinminer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on a fake Malwarebytes installer</a> that we detected on over 100,000 machines protected by Avast. This installer attempted to pass itself off as the legitimate Malwarebytes installer, mimicking it to a great extent – it was distributed under the same filename, it used the same icon and it created a Malwarebytes installation directory containing legitimate PE files digitally signed by Malwarebytes. However, that was all just a pretense, because the installer did not actually install Malwarebytes. In fact, the installer’s main purpose was to open a backdoor to attacker-controlled servers in order to give its operators the ability to push additional malicious payloads to the infected machines.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="829" height="509" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png 829w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-300x184.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px"><figcaption>A map illustrating the distribution of Avast users protected from the FakeMBAM backdoor. The backdoor is most active in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In our first report, we stated that we did not know how this fake installer was being distributed. Since then, we spent some time reverse engineering the malware and investigating its infection vector. We found that the fake installer was pushed to the victims’ machines through automatic updates of one torrent client (<code>download[.]studio</code>) and three adblockers (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>, <code>myadblock[.]com</code> and <code>netadblock[.]com</code>). Listed on the websites of these applications are three different companies that are supposedly behind these applications, “Sigma Software”, “GRAND MEDIA, TOV” and “Birmon Software”. However, based on high code similarities and shared infrastructure (and on the fact that they all distributed the very same piece of malware), we consider it very likely that there is one actor behind all four applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Download Studio</h3>



<p>To investigate the infection vector used to distribute the fake installer, we first turned to the metadata that was submitted to us when we detected the installer in the wild. This provided us with two important clues: The installers were supposed to be executed with the command line arguments <code>/SP- /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /NOCANCEL /NOICONS</code>, by a process named <code>dstudio-gui.exe</code>. The first clue suggested that the installer was not supposed to be spread through social engineering, because the above arguments instruct Inno Setup to install software silently in the background. The second clue hinted at the possible suspect: Download Studio.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="699" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-300x205.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-768x524.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website.png 1163w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of the Download Studio product page.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Download Studio is a free torrent client popular in Russia and Ukraine. It features an embedded library of torrent files, offering a wide selection of movies, software, video games, music and more. As is usually the case with torrent downloaders, there is a lot of copyrighted material that can be easily downloaded for free using this software, which seems to be the main reason why it is so widespread. Download Studio is detected by some anti-malware software as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or as riskware, because it encourages illegal behavior and puts its users at risk through downloading torrents of unknown origin.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="639" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-300x187.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-768x479.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot.png 1234w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of Download Studio’s movie library.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To clear up some potential confusion, let us state that there is also another piece of software named Download Studio: <a href="http://www.conceiva.com/products/downloadstudio/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a download manager developed by Conceiva</a>. Apart from the name, this software has nothing in common with the torrent client described in this blog post and there is therefore no reason to doubt its legitimacy. In the rest of this blog post, the name Download Studio will denote the torrent client described in the previous paragraph.</p>



<p>Since Download Studio can be used to download various software, it would make sense to think that the fake Malwarebytes installer was distributed through it as a regular torrent file (after all there were 609 results when we searched for “Malwarebytes” inside Download Studio). However, that would not explain the command line arguments that we observed in the wild. They simply indicated that running the installer was not a user-initiated action and that the user might not have been aware of the installer at all. Furthermore, the number of users that we protected from the fake installer matched our estimates of the number of Avast users running Download Studio, which made it look like Download Studio itself was somehow responsible. Therefore, we decided to reverse engineer it to see if it contained hidden malicious code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We immediately found some evident code similarities with the FakeMBAM backdoor. Both Download Studio and the backdoor were developed using the Qt framework and they both used the very same string obfuscation methods. One of the obfuscation methods was particularly interesting, because it was not very effective at, well, obfuscation. It consisted of XORing the obfuscated string twice with the same mask, so the plaintext was clearly visible in the disassembly.</p>

<p>Other code similarities were found in a piece of code that computed HMAC of custom HTTP headers or in a piece of code that created scheduled tasks using the <code>ITaskService </code>COM interface. We also found that Download Studio contained a string with the exact command line arguments that we mentioned earlier. These arguments were used to execute application updates silently in the background. By reverse engineering Download Studio, we also found that the application updates are supposed to be executed from a temporary directory the name of which can be described by the regular expression <code>ds-\d{7}\.tmp</code>, which further matched our metadata from detections of the fake installer.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EYMmgDsZBnHuIzdKo7GQt5DdYt6l7syDb4q3c1qFhXzhW4qMCp8SuY2yl0csbOzTBRbt-0p5zDqgY5X8BM4SdnQN1b1nSG7neF4-80rOm2-x9HK7ci-S7XagvX8tXUcUJQjwcmb-" alt=""><figcaption>Disassembled snippet of Download Studio, showing the code responsible for execution of automatic updates.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point, it seemed almost certain that the backdoor was distributed through the automatic updates of Download Studio. However, we wanted to be absolutely sure that this was the case, so we monitored the updates and logged the filename and hash of each observed update. This gave us the following list:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SHA-256</td><td>filename</td></tr><tr><td><code>16d0559067f3cc0ab19e22b935ac90d44897f09f3426f858498dfd7e667c4bda</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>1d77fdc7f1b1efc8bdb0938cacc713baa70a2549412ce0be18adf2ebd133cb70</code></td><td><code>updater-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>333dd34d3efc4ded71b36f5fc38bce67de71f80b7fab43358a36e8ba7d4df0f0</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>5822d2b9717cc2a87ba54173587a3808e17f5961f42f5b1702c4a75950ecd4f6</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>6754c5e7d3c03f4e2bf29b013b1a0d532b7f4e8e145da82e6973376785938f65</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>9c112b452ce839536a5cd4a3d8f4999adcb03dc3af5cbd86ca3a477c5b75127b</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b1acc87c7b010f4aafbe03cd70a6452679de07ef31bc2d5701de63d573654615</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b3359c92cd87bd39ecbf8159666f2c7e123903751654bb8aefd714e23f8e7f7f</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b4039b6a15af681d7c02d1ff798f41023a378668b32132761c8cdffd648a5a5d</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>c759c6fffe3d32424f8b29b58ee5cb11d68be5f27e50ba1d1a4755fb56602f7d</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>dfb1a78be311216cd0aa5cb78759875cd7a2eeb5cc04a8abc38ba340145f72b9</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>f2caa14fd11685ba28068ea79e58bf0b140379b65921896e227a0c7db30a0f2c</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Just based on the filenames alone, the last two entries immediately stand out. Indeed, while all the previous entries correspond to legitimate updates of Download Studio, the last two hashes are the fake Malwarebytes installers that we have been investigating. They were executed in the same way as all the other automatic updates, silently in the background and without the users’ awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that someone tried to infect all users of Download Studio with the FakeMBAM backdoor. While we do not know precisely what happened behind the scenes, there are three possible scenarios that come to mind. The first one would be that the developers of Download Studio wished to “monetize” their large install base in a very unethical way. Code reuse between Download Studio and the FakeMBAM backdoor would suggest that this could be the case. Another explanation is that the backdoor was spread by a group of rogue employees who acted without the knowledge of the rest of the company. Finally, it is also possible that some unknown attacker hacked Download Studio and carried out a successful supply chain attack.</p>



<p>We were looking for some answers and so we reached out to the developers of Download Studio, asking about the backdoor. They claimed that they detected a security incident on their continuous integration server in August 2020 and that they have since thoroughly investigated this incident and put additional security measures in place. They did not respond to our additional inquiries about how many of their users could be impacted by this incident and if they notified the impacted users.</p>



<h3>Adblockers</h3>



<p>Download Studio was not the only software that distributed the FakeMBAM backdoor. We also found three adblockers whose automatic updates were abused in the same fashion. These adblockers are NetShield Kit (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>), My AdBlock (<code>myadblock[.]com</code>) and …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>In 2020, we were happy to have talked to <strong>94</strong> (!) remote tool companies about what they are up to. With more than a dozen we talked a little closer and many of them we've shown you. However, amongst the sea of amazing new innovations in the remote work space, we still found gaps.</p>
<p>Struggles we've heard from remote teams that don't have a solution yet. Solutions that are missing that little something to make them amazing. These are our wishes for the next year.</p>

<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>Running an internationally distributed team has a lot of challenges to overcome, but the most rigid of them all are international regulations and specializations when it comes to running a multi-national organization.</p>
<p>The operations side of remote work is usually deemed pretty unsexy. It's all about working with regulators, shaking hands and most likely an expensive journey to expand in a lot of countries. Hard work, but one that wouldn't go unappreciated.</p>

<h3>1. Better payment gateways for remote teams</h3>
<p>For how far we've come with remote work, we really haven't made a ton of strides with cross-continental payments. In my first-ever remote job, I used to get paid from a regular US corporate bank account directly to my swiss bank account. Payments got routed wrongly here and there, the fees were sky-high and the payments often took a week to get to me.</p>
<p>Since then, we've made a stride or two. With something like <a href="https://bit.ly/3kzvDyo">TransferWise,</a> you can make the whole process a little bit speedier and cheaper. Transfers now only take 1-2 working days and are fairly transparent. Even better: Fees and availability aren't confined to one nation, TransferWise is almost available anywhere.</p>
<p>Then, there are online wallets like Venmo and PayPal. They are really handy to guarantee instant transfers at a cheap price and are very handy for folks that are unbanked. Skipping the dusty banking infrastructure? All for it!</p>
<p>And then, of course, there's cryptocurrency. Now, Bitcoin &amp; co. were never meant to become investment instruments. In the past year, I asked to get paid for something through crypto twice. The payments were instant, extremely cheap (<em>I paid around $0.001 in fees</em>) and my bank didn't ask me about that weird big-money-transfer from the US. Now, if it only was easier to access.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_online_payments_luau.png" alt="" width="600" height="370"></p>

<p>So, how does the payment gateway of the future look like? Well, first of all, it should be accessible. Too many financial services are confined to the US, Canada and the UK. It should also be internationally receivable. While a bank transfer almost goes anywhere, I've heard multiple times now that people would prefer not getting foreign direct-to-bank payments to accounts in India, for example. The remote payment stack accounts for that.</p>
<p>Finally, waiting for your pay stub and then the money a couple of days later really doesn't fit in the internet age anymore. <strong>Maybe you can leverage cryptocurrency and existing infrastructure to create something instant, simple and internationally accessible?</strong></p>

<h3>2. Making 401k international</h3>
<p>When it comes to retirement benefits, many remote companies don't take it 100% seriously just yet and according to the latest surveys, employees don't mind either. With work-life balance as a commonly cited benefit, being remote in itself is an amazing perk. People are happy to take a pay cut or even let go of their retirement benefits.</p>
<p>Even if a company is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#general-and-entity-benefits">open to having a 401k</a>, doing it the "right" away is almost impossible with every country having its own system. From the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensionskasse">Pensionskasse</a> in Germany to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_in_Japan">EPS</a> in Japan, countries run their own systems that are usually not accessible to foreign entities.</p>
<p>This might not seem important at first, but according to <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~vchern/papers/ch_401k.pdf">researchers at MIT</a> and multiple financial advisories, taking part in and maxing out 401k accounts (and subsequent alternatives in other countries) is a cornerstone to building life-changing wealth. For all personal finance lovers out there, not having that option may be a dealbreaker. Offering 401k and other retirement benefits is about to get a lot more important.</p>
<p>Our idea: <strong>What can a private company build within the regulations that allows for true, employer-matched and internationally available retirement accounts?</strong> Piggy-back off existing infrastructure and regulations? Sell gold bars and store them in a few storage units? Some sort of e-insurance? Again, cryptocurrency? We'd love to hear ideas.</p>

<h3>3. Benefits that are not only show</h3>
<p>For most remote companies, "perks" and "benefits" under the hood only mean a bit more money. In all remote jobs I've had so far, I've claimed my perk payouts as part of my regular salary payout. That means additional taxable income, not what perks are about.</p>
<p>Let me explain. A few years ago, my friend got hired at a very generous company local to us. He got a generous salary but was additionally able to lease a car through the company, set up a subscription for lunch delivery and for a while was even able to rent a room out of the company's real estate arm. The costs of that were deducted directly from his salary. As a result of that, he paid a few $1,000 less in taxes than in the previous years.</p>
<p>Many of those perks – from a company car to new Macbook – are much easier to reimburse in cash for remote companies, so no pre-tax perks at all. <strong>As a potential new service, what can you do to make this happen?</strong></p>
<p>One option is to hire through one of the many <a href="https://nohq.co/hire/">EOR services</a> that specialize in providing a full-service. For many companies that already have their payroll in order, that's not interesting though. You could save people multiple $1,000s in taxes here, so it's a service you don't have to sell for cheap.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Communication is still the king of all remote tools. Out of the many tools we've seen this year, probably 2/3 were in the communication and collaboration space of some sort. So, what gaps are supposed to still be there? Let's walk through it.</p>

<h3>4. All-hands meetings that work</h3>
<p>I believe meetings are largely figured out. This year, we've seen some iterations on the traditional meeting experience, but most of them are a minor improvement for teams that have an amazing product-fit. One thing that isn't solved yet is large, moderated all-hands meetings.</p>
<p>All-hands meetings are meetings that include all, or at least most of the company in the same meeting. The meeting experience is fundamentally different from your standard small group meeting: The speaker is in focus and other participants rarely speak.</p>
<p>The relationship between speaker and listener is quite clear – one speaker, many participants (often over 100) that should be able to speak when called to do so but not otherwise. The experience of such meetings has improved with new meeting software, compared to teams that had to make-do with Skype &amp; co., but it's still not seamless.</p>

<p><em>"At some point, to have everyone on a Skype call for an all-hands meeting, we would have two laptops set up next to each other and have one laptop call half the company and the other laptop call the other half of the company. That was nonsense ðŸ˜„"</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://nohq.co/blog/michael-fey-of-1password/">Michael Frey, VP Engineering at 1Password</a></strong></p>

<p>The last time I had an all-hands meeting on Zoom, things didn't go great. Some people called in and were unable to mute themselves. People tried to ask questions but got interrupted by either the speaker or another person in the audience.</p>
<p>With over 100 participants, latency was all over the place and the worst part – the meeting host had a disconnect at some point in the meeting and while the room was able to continue, the recording stopped there. A third of the team was not able to re-play the meeting.</p>
<p>I believe all-hands meetings warrant a new piece of tech that is rarely used – probably only for larger talks and announcements once a month – but works for that type of meeting every single time, including server-side recording, low latency, speaking requests and a larger range of moderation features.</p>

<h3>5. Communication &amp; Writing Training</h3>
<p>Communication and writing skills have been essential requirements for modern remote teams that largely rely on sparse and long-form communication. Many talented people struggle with that, are either not used or accommodated to typing a lot of simply prefer the face-to-face way of doing things.</p>
<p>Just like we build our knowledge worker's skills using education stipends, conferences, courses and books, we should also start looking into active communication training.</p>
<p>In the past, I have benefitted from coaching a lot in my career. Coaches have helped me push through some tough professional issues and have helped me build a small successful business. In the future, coaching will not only be interesting for hard skills but possibly even more soft skills. Getting continuous training in communication and writing will be popular with goal-getters and teams alike.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not necessarily advocating for plain and simple writing training. <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> has put an automated writing coach in many author's pockets, but what if you could push that further? Remind you that you didn't give a status update in a while? Notifying you if your text lacks some context or reads passive-aggressive. Grammarly works great, even as I am writing this post, but it's not an end-to-end communication coach, just an integral part of it. <strong>We'd love to see something new in that space.</strong></p>

<h3>6. Asynchronous Brainstorm</h3>
<p>A consistent piece of feedback we've gotten this year is that teams struggle to find a good way to brainstorm new innovations. Remote work is amazing to get into a deep state, collect some thoughts and find new ideas, but when it comes to collaboration and getting those thoughts out, it gets more difficult.</p>
<p>The way we've learned to brainstorm in the professional world is using visualizations. We like to draw mind maps or sketch graphs on a whiteboard. Filling out the blank space can indeed yield new ideas and has helped really innovative teams come up with amazing ideas.</p>

<h2 id="flyover-country">Flyover Country</h2>

<p>When I was younger and my family finally made it <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2014/05/upward-immigrant-toy-mobility-in-the-wild-1990s/">to the American middle class</a>, we went on vacations to Europe. Plane travel was a lot more boring in the days before cell phones, and I would spend a significant amount of any given flight tracking the progress of the tiny plane icon on the flickering screen. When Godthab, Greenland, and then the tiny dot labeled Reykjavik appeared on the legend, I knew we were close to our destination across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>For most traveling Americans, until very recently, Iceland was no more than a flyover destination. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932011_Icelandic_financial_crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>, the eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallajökull</a>, and the filming of Game of Thrones <a href="http://icelandmag.visir.is/article/thingvellir-featured-first-episode-season-4-game-thrones">there</a>, combined with aggressive marketing and low pricing by Iceland’s two airlines have drastically improved Iceland’s standing on the map.</p>

<p>Today, if you talk to any pour-over coffee drinker living within driving distance of an Ikea, there’s a seventy-six bajillion percent chance they’ve been. Since over <a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/18/13261804/iceland-tourism-on-the-rise">1.5 million tourists hit Iceland last year</a> it really seems like everyone I know has either been, or is headed north.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, Iceland is still not a country Americans really pay attention to. I mean, we don’t care about most things that aren’t Kardashian, but Iceland, nestled way up against the Arctic Circle with a population smaller than Cleveland, can be easy to overlook.  As such, I had no preconceived notions going in. But, almost immediately I was won over.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-iceland-heres-some-júníus-meyvant">Welcome to Iceland. Here’s some Júníus Meyvant</h2>

<p>What amazed me the most was that there is a USB charging port right next to the TV screen of my Icelandair flight. I’ve flown an average amount, and nowhere yet have I seen this feature in economy class on American planes.</p>

<p>At first glance, this, seems like a totally banal yuppie thing to get excited about. But if you are flying with a smartphone, it’s a HUGE relief not to have to worry about charging in the airport where you land, saving battery, and generally running around like crazy on what should be your vacation or business trip. You just plug in, and you’re ready to go. It’s a really small thing that makes a huge difference in peace of mind for travelers.</p>

<p>As we boarded, Icelandair also played <a href="https://soundcloud.com/recordrecords/junius-meyvant-neon-experience-1">soft mood music</a> from a <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/icelandair">Spotify playlist</a>. To someone who is used to traveling within the American flight culture, where you’re lucky if the flight attendants throwing $14 bags of peanuts at you hit in the general vicinity of your torso, it was all very new. And, of course, you could track the flight path on your phone free of charge.</p>

<p>It so happened that we went to Iceland because Mr. B was invited to a bachelor party there.  In my day, these parties were held at local dive bars where the floor was more Miller Lite than laminate, but that was before Instagram. I decided to tag along for a couple days before the party, because Iceland was so close, and because it’s been a while since I’ve travelled further than the distance between the crib and the couch.</p>

<p>We got in at six in the morning, but even in my red-eyed haze, I could see just how pristine everything at Keflavík Airport was. My freshly-charged phone immediately connected to Iceland’s Vodafone network without a glitch.  “We’re here. Everything is clean and smells like Ikea,” I texted my mom.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/airport.png" width="400"></p>

<p>I had already booked a ticket on <a href="https://www.re.is/flybus/">Flybus</a>, which goes from Keflavík to Reykjavik, online, so all we had to do was get on and wait. I’ve never been brave enough to take public transportation from the airport anywhere I’ve been, including even Israel, where I speak the language, but the website made it so easy. The bus, like the plane, had Wi-Fi, a feature we’d see being offered again and again on buses, in cafes, restaurants, and bookstores, like a lure to trap urban Americans wearing plaid button-downs.</p>

<h2 id="iceland-is-for-humans">Iceland is for humans</h2>

<p>From the get-go, there were a lot of things in Iceland that seemed like they were out of a fairy tale about what an ideal human life should look like, at least from the perspective of someone living in the United States.</p>

<p>For example, on our first day, our guide from <a href="http://www.iheartreykjavik.net/">I Heart Reykjavik</a>, took us on a walk through Reykjavik, stopping at a small building that looked like something out of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. “That’s the prime minister’s office,” she told us. “No guards, nothing. He just goes about his work here.” We walked on, towards another two-story building that looked like an office for a small-to-medium business.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/Althingi.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>It was the national Parliament, the Alþingi. “It’s made up of 48% women,” our guide said.  “We’re just short of 50%,” she continued ruefully. I have to admit, I had a sharp intake of breath. It sounded like an impossible miracle. But in Iceland, equality, and more importantly, humanity, shows itself in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>There is the USB charger so you don’t have to coddle your smartphone like an animal.  In the big picture, there is <a href="https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2017/05/05/poll-most-icelanders-support-equal-pay-law/">gender equality</a>. Not only do women make up a large percentage of the workforce, but childcare is heavily subsidized, costing something like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/28/iceland-women-feminist-paradise-gender-gap-pay">$180 a month per child</a> for eight hours of childcare, including food. Mr. B and I personally pay $800/month, and I know our daycare is on the cheaper end.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/woke.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>There is also a large <a href="https://grapevine.is/news/2017/05/03/only-3400-unemployed-in-iceland/">social safety net</a>, healthcare, and all the goodies that make Scandinavia – Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Additionally, I felt more like a treasured guest than a potential criminal when passing through Icelandic customs, more than I can say for my trip back to the country where I’m actually a citizen.</p>

<p>But there is a lot of humanity in the small things, too. For example, the tap water is not only potable, but delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/water.jpeg" width="400"></p>

<p>When we went to buy a bottle of water at the supermarket, the clerk looked at us like we were crazy. “You know it’s the same thing in the tap,” she said, motioning for us to put the bottle back. The shower water smells like sulfur, because all of Iceland gets its cold water from a glacier, and hot water from <a href="http://wakeupreykjavik.com/the-icelandic-water/">geothermal heating.</a></p>

<p>Then, there’s the matter of the prisons. The <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">old town prison in Reykjavik</a>, which had no wire fence around it, or even bars on the windows, grew too small (it can only house 16 prisoners) and is being reconsidered for repurpose as a cultural center.  The current prison population of Iceland is <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">153</a>, or less than one tenth of one percent of the population.</p>

<p>Oh, and everyone speaks nearly perfect English.</p>

<p>It seems very, very hard to find anything wrong with Iceland. Until you get to the financial crisis of 2008, when the three largest banks folded, the currency plummeted, and unparalleled levels of corruption were exposed in the government, leading to massive unemployment and genuine fear and panic.</p>

<p>But even as large and traumatic as that <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/iceland-financial-crisis-bankruptcy-and-economy-3306347">devastating moment of extremely poor judgement for the country</a>, was, Iceland now seems to have passed it, i<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35485876">f not with flying colors</a>, at least with more wisdom and grace than the U.S. could muster up during its own fall.  It’s true that the krona has fallen and Iceland experienced a brain drain after the crisis. But it’s also true that a restructuring of the economy has led to a significant decrease in unemployment. The bankers that caused the 2008 financial crisis <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-03-31/welcome-to-iceland-where-bad-bankers-go-to-prison">are also in prison</a>, where they “spend their days doing laundry, working out in the jailhouse gym, and browsing the Internet.” “Sometimes they go horseback riding,” our guide said.</p>

<p>The economy has been on the upswing since 2011, particularly with a lot of strength in the tourism sector, which the Icelandic government is heavily pushing - probably the reason all my friends have known about it. The low cost of the airfare to Iceland relative to Europe or even the West Coast in America, thanks to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/business/filling-a-trans-atlantic-air-niche.html?pagewanted=all">hub and spoke model</a> (Iceland is a huge place for flights from Europe and the United States to connect, thus maximizing capacity and optimizing costs for travelers), is huge.</p>

<h2 id="from-lice-to-nice">From lice to nice</h2>

<p>How did Iceland get to this point?  Originally settled in the 10th century by Vikings (and any <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/why-people-in-iceland-look-just-like-us-1.1104676">Irish slaves</a> they picked up on the way), the island was not a very hospitable place.  When the settlers first came, there were almost no native animal species, so they had to bring by boat all the livestock they could to survive. There were also few trees, meaning most houses were made of mud and turf. Life was simply miserable for the first thousand years of Iceland’s existence.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/thingvallir.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Also, the weather in Iceland is terrible. There are two seasons: rain, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laki">lava</a>. Exposed to both the Arctic wind and laid bare to all the vagaries of the Atlantic Ocean, it rains at least a little every day, in spurts. It was sunny for maybe 15 minutes that I was there. On a particularly windy day, we went <a href="http://eldhestar.is/">riding</a> on the <a href="http://www.visiticeland.com/things-to-do/activities/the-icelandic-horse">small, sturdy horses</a> that are descendants of the original horses the Vikings brought over (no imports are allowed to keep the purity of the breed), and all I could think about, instead of focusing on the beautiful, broody landscape of Hveragerði was about how many Vikings died of pneumonia and ear infections.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/us.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Things got marginally better over the centuries with more established trade routes, but as late as the the 1800s, men were climbing vertical cliffs plunging to the sea to steal sea bird eggs from ledges. Without these natural “pantries”, a large amount of Icelanders would likely have starved. If you weren’t killed by hunger, the climate, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Abductions">random Turkish raiding parties</a>,  there were always the eagles, one of the only native bird species to grace the island.</p>

<p>The economy really kicked into gear when exposed to the economic crosswinds of World War II, and, of course the British and the Americans. Once the economy took off, it’s been going. Iceland is now diversified away …</p></article></div></div>

<li><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-threat-modeling-machine-learning/">Attacks</a>: Some of the attacks I want to investigate, learn about, and try out</li>
</ul>
<p>A few weeks ago while preparing demos for my GrayHat 2020 - Red Team Village presentation I ran across “Image Scaling Attacks” in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-quiring.pdf">Adversarial Preprocessing: Understanding and Preventing Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning</a> by Erwin Quiring, et al.</p>
<p>I thought that was so cool!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-image-scaling-attack">What is an image scaling attack?</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to hide a smaller image inside a larger image (it should be about 5-10x the size). The attack is easy to explain actually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker crafts a malicious input image by hiding the desired target image inside a benign image</li>
<li>The image is loaded by the server</li>
<li>Pre-processing resizes the image</li>
<li>The server acts and makes decision based on a different image then intended</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was to hide a husky image inside another image:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>Here are the two images I used - before and after the modification:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the second image does have some strange dots all around. But this is not noticable when viewed in smaller version.</p>
<p>You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/EQuiw/2019-scalingattack">Github</a>. I used Google Colab to run it, and there were some errors initialy but it worked - let me know if interested and I can clean up and share the Notebook also.</p>
<h2 id="rescaling-and-magic-happens">Rescaling and magic happens!</h2>
<p>Now, look what happens when the image is loaded and resized with <code>OpenCV</code> using default settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see the original sized image, and on the left the same image downsized to 128x128 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>That’s amazing!</strong></p>
<p>The downsized image is an entirely different picture now! Of course I picked a husky, since I wanted to attack “Husky AI” and find another bypass.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This can have a set of implications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training process:</strong> Images that poisen the training data (as pre-processing rescales images)</li>
<li><strong>Model queries:</strong> The model might predict on a different image than the one the user uploaded</li>
<li><strong>Non ML related attacks:</strong> This can also be an issue in other, non machine learning areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess security never gets boring, there is always something new to learn.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>Turns out that Husky AI uses PIL and that was not vulnerable to this attack by default.</p>
<p>I got lucky, because initially Husky AI did use <code>OpenCV</code> and it’s default settings to resize images. But for some reason I changed that early on (not knowing it would also mitigate this attack).</p>
<p>If you use <code>OpenCV</code> the issue can be fixed by using the <code>interpolation</code> argument when calling the <code>resize</code> API to not have it use the default.</p>
<p>Hope that was useful and interesting.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Johann.</p>

<p>Firearms (guns) are one of the hot button issues in the United States and globally. I’m sure it is understandable why — pull the trigger and something dies. Killing is the primary purpose of a firearm. Naturally, this leads many to be fearful of firearms, but should people be fearful?</p>
<p>When I started writing this, I wanted to answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are firearms inherently unsafe?</p>
<p>Should firearms be banned, as many believe?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s quite ambitious. One may believe you can just find an answer on a website / paper somewhere or is obvious. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated and has turned this into my longest article to date.</p>
<p>It’s been said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. <em>– unknown</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many agree and many others strongly disagree. That divisiveness has made firearms a political issue, leading to a plethora of bias studies, inaccurate analysis, and more. Thus, to answer these questions I had to go through the data myself; I pulled <a href="#Data_Tooling">data from the CDC, FBI, RAND, Census and others</a> and completed my own analysis.</p>
<p>For those interested, a PDF version of this document you can download here: <a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-by-the-Numbers.pdf">Firearms by the Numbers</a>.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of this analysis, it is important to highlight some items upfront.</p>
<p>1. The United States is often the focus throughout the analysis. This is because the United States has an abundance of firearms, a relatively uniform society and the most available &amp; accurate records.</p>
<p>2. This analysis focuses on general trends. Specific situations vary wildly, even in the same region: country, state, county, city, and neighborhood situations vary. As such, I caution making detailed / specific inference, beyond what the data explicitly shows (in the general case).</p>
<p>3. Some important data is lacking, such as socioeconomic status associated with crimes. This makes it very difficult to isolate confounding factors and leads to confusion / lack of definitive answer(s).</p>
<p>The goal of this analysis was to analyze available (and unbiased) data as in-depth as enabled, with no particular outcome in mind. <em>If new data comes in that materially changes what can be inferred, I’ll attempt to update the analysis.</em> With that in mind, I want to highlight that I dive into demographic information and I found some surprises. Politics seems to stifle this topic and in fact the truth. Instead I went to the data, I hope you can find it as interesting as I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is not for all men, but only for those who seek it.<br>
– Ayn Rand</p></blockquote>
<p>If anything in this analysis was missed,<strong> please feel free to reach out or leave comments.</strong></p>


<p>Globally, firearms are highly controlled, particularly in the Europe and Asia. In contrast, the United States has more firearms held by it’s citizens than the rest of the world combined.<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w"></a>The real question — do the number of firearms really matter? From the graph above, it’s clear China, Russia and Iran have a high number of military firearms when compared civilian held firearms (and I suspect most civilian held firearms are former military, in countries such as China, Russia ,Iran, India, etc). In contrast, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free world</a>” has an order of magnitude more civilian firearms, when compared to military firearms.</p>
<p>Clearly, what matters to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second world</a>” is having a large military arsenal, when compared to civilian held firearms.</p>
<p>It can be argued an unarmed society allows the military to impose their will, allowing countries to maintain the status quo and avoiding violent revolutions overthrowing the government.</p>
<h2><span id="Homicides_Firearms_Globally"></span>Homicides &amp; Firearms Globally<span></span></h2>
<p>In the “free world,” the main concern surrounding firearms are homicides &amp; suicides, with homicides being the most concerning. Below is a comparison of homicides by firearm deaths per 100,000 people across the globe.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" alt="" width="1228" height="677" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w"></a>When we compare the world, a few things become clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>The America’s, Caribbean and Africa have a much higher firearm homicide rate</li>
<li>The United States has the highest firearm homicide rate of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first world</a>” country</li>
<li>Europe has the lowest firearm homicide rate globally</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s not clear, is whether or not firearms are really leading the increased firearm homicide rate.</p>
<p>Are homicides just naturally higher in these regions?</p>
<h2><span id="Firearm_Death_Rate_per_Firearm"></span>Firearm Death Rate per Firearm<span></span></h2>
<p>Below is an argument from the Amnesty International’s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>governments [with] poor regulation of the possession and use of <strong>guns lead to violence</strong> and that they must tackle this now through strict controls on guns and effective interventions in communities suffering high levels of gun violence.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key statement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns lead to violence</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement above implies a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gun volume and violence are correlated</li>
<li>As the number of guns increase, violence increases</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few ways to invalidate / validate this statement. The clearest method is to simply compare firearm deaths per firearm. If firearms lead to more violence, we should see the ratio of firearm deaths to firearms (firearm deaths / firearms) staying constant (or growing at a constant rate). This ratio should stay or grow at a constant rate because as the firearm count increases, the firearm homicides should increase (keeping the ratio constant). We could also assume a direct correlation if “guns lead to violence” as it would probably occur at some constant rate.</p>
<p>Below you can see the comparison between firearm deaths and firearms:</p>

In contrast, “First World” (Europe and the United States) has a much lower number of fatalities per firearm, the United States having only one death per ten thousand firearms.</p>
<h3><span id="Firearms_vs_Homicide_Rate"></span>Firearms vs Homicide Rate<span></span></h3>
<p>For further evidence firearms aren’t correlated with violence, it’s possible to directly compare the number of firearms vs homicides:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w"></a>Across the bottom of the chart you can see all the countries with high homicide rates. The United States stands out clearly, if firearms were correlated with homicides we’d expect the U.S. to have many more homicides than it currently does. It does not appear more firearms are correlated with more homicides, in fact the trend line shows the opposite to be true (more firearms are correlated to less homicides).</p>
<p>For a final validation, we can compare firearms against homicides and firearm homicides against total homicides. Both should have a similar growth rate, if there was a correlation.</p>

<p>It’s important to note the graph is a logarithmic comparison for homicides and homicides by firearm (firearms per 100k Inhabitants are not logarithmic). The trend line comparison of Total Homicides and Homicides by Firearm is linear, because the comparison is logarithmic, it appears exponential on the chart.</p>
<p>It is clear as homicides increase, homicides by firearm increase (blue data points). In contrast, when there are more firearms, homicides by firearm remain flat (purple data points), implying more firearms do not cause increase the number of homicides involving a firearm.</p>
<p>Further, you can see the blue star representing the United States homicide rate to homicide firearm deaths is right where it is expected. However, the purple star, representing the United States homicide rate to firearms per 100k inhabitants, is way outside the norm.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, as the firearm homicide rate increases, the total homicide rate increases; as the prevalence of firearms increase, the homicide rate <span>does not increase</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States is clearly the largest holder of firearms in the world, most states have more firearms than entire countries. Fun fact:</p>
<blockquote><p>Texans and the Chinese military have the same number of firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there’s a culture of gun ownership in the United States. When the United States was formed it had just fought a war of independence and regularly combated Native Americans, settling North America by force. Even today, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States National Guard</a> is one of the largest militias in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.<br>
–<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/"> Constitution of the United States</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Without diving into politics, the constitution &amp; culture has enabled the United States to be relatively unique. Firearms are regulated, but just barely. Generally, citizens can do everything from carrying a firearms in public to purchasing assault rifles, flamethrowers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniguns</a>, rocket launcher(s), etc. Often the only requirement is obtaining permit to own weapons, after that you can regularly purchase as many firearms as you’d like.</p>
<p>As seen in the previous section, the United States does have a higher (on average) number of firearm deaths. However, this doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. In the prior section, we focused on the homicide rate. In the following sections, the focus will expand as uniform data collection, similar social norms and a widespread framework for law makes comparisons much easier.</p>
<p>Some topics we will explore here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide vs homicide vs accidental rates</li>
<li>The type of weapons used in homicides</li>
<li>How demographics impact firearm fatalities</li>
<li>How firearm fatalities compare to other fatalities</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Suicides_Homicides_in_the_United_States"></span>Suicides &amp; Homicides in the United States<span></span></h2>
<p>First, it is also important to highlight just how small the number of firearm related homicides really are, when compared to all deaths. On average, the total (suicide, homicide &amp; accidental) number of firearm related fatalities account for about 1.33% of all deaths in the United States (firearm related homicides account for ~0.44% of all deaths) and it varies wildly between states.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important item to discuss is the “<em>firearm fatality rate</em>“, often conflated with the “<em>firearm homicide rate</em>” by political pundits. While all fatalities are unfortunate, most American’s would argue there is a different between <em>suicides</em> and <em>homicides</em>. Some states, such as Washington, support medically assisted suicides (for the terminally ill).</p></div></article></div>

</p>
<p>There’s a popular book called “JavaScript: The Good Parts.” And there’s a common meme around the relative size of that book versus “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is in my opinion a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it’s also an old language with some historical baggage. And in many ways it’s a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes… half-baked features. And due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it sometimes will break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>True mastery of Haskell comes down to knowing which things in core libraries should be avoided like the plague.</p><p>* foldl<br>* sum/product<br>* Data.Text.IO<br>* Control.Exception.bracket (use unliftio instead, handles interruptible correctly)</p><p>Just as some examples</p></div>— Michael Snoyman (@snoyberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1321049221697544193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments in that thread, I decided a longer form blog post was in order. I’m going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there’s more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you’d like me to address, input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2>What is a “bad part”</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing as a language feature, function, type, or library that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it’s still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a “bad part” of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely-useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There’s an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart’s content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I’m not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of “yes, but there’s this one corner case where it’s actually useful.”</p>
<h2>Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I’m a Haskeller and advocate of the language, you may be wondering: why am I attacking Haskell? I don’t see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues, and I think it’s a fair thing to say that the problems I’m listing are warts on the language. But every language has warts. I’m writing this because I’ve seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I’ve seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim that “if it compiles it works.” I’ve seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. And then, either we can fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I’m going to take a more jovial tone below. I personally find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2>foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It’s a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. Too many space leaks have been caused by this function. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn’t the fact that this function exists. It’s the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I’m sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can’t raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don’t, we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart which is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won’t. I’d rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn’t export a bad function, and does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I’m going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2>sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list’s <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. “Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?” Only if you’re folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of that terminology: “strict in both arguments” means “in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments.” I can’t evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn’t require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say. “What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!”</p>
<p>That’s true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter, GHC will optimize this away.” Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC’s optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we’ll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2>Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I’ve already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talk about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad, and I’ll reiterate why in a second. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse. The reason is that there’s pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We’re all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It’s possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I’ve encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don’t quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don’t care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically “just works.” Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That’s when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. “Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash.” But it’s worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can’t build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don’t let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!” Yeah, maybe. It’s also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That’s why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I’ve devoted a large percentage to my Haskell teaching career towards them. Async exceptions are a concept that don’t truly exist in most other languages. They require rewiring the way your brain works for …</p></div></div>

<p>Call me arrogant, but I’d rather optimize my indoor environment than try to spend more time in the capricious outdoors. I think it’s defeatism to give up on improving our indoor spaces and resign ourselves to the fickle weather and seasons. </p>
<p>If I was going to create an ideal environment for a human, I think there are several things I would include that we routinely fail to include in our homes and offices.</p>
<h3 id="lighting">Lighting</h3>
<p>Our indoor lighting situation usually sucks. The fact that “natural lighting” is a selling point in real estate shows how terrible a job we are doing in this department. We rely on the sun naturally providing us with sufficient light, and if it’s an overcast day or the days have grown shorter in the winter, then I guess we’re shit out of luck. </p>
<p>Usually, indoor areas are around 50-500 lux. This is hundreds of times dimmer than the sunlight. Clearly, we weren’t designed to thrive in such dim environments, and science does verify a connection between brighter light and alertness. If we don’t want to be sleepy like it’s nighttime, we shouldn’t light our rooms like it’s nighttime. For some, the effects of dim lighting go beyond simple lethargy and, especially in the winter, cause serious mood problems like seasonal affective disorder or the winter blues. This is common, but it’s not necessary. Bright light, particularly blue light, can also generally boost mood and may be a comparable stimulant to caffeine. (Those who are prone to mania should be careful, as intense light can trigger mania or hypomania in those predisposed.) Brighter lighting can also help circadian rhythm issues (which I, for example, have struggled with for years), both by entraining your circadian rhythm so your body better knows when it’s day, and by shortening it if it’s too long. </p>
<p>Lighting isn’t as expensive as it used to be, so we can do better than we have in the past. The cost of electricity for LED lighting is now negligible, and the only real factor is the cost of the bulbs themselves. Reaching for the full 100,000 lux of sunlight would still be prohibitively expensive, but going for at least 10,000 lux is doable with only a few hundred dollars. I won’t go into specifics here, but you can get more information on specific lighting setups <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator">here</a> or <a href="https://meaningness.com/metablog/sad-light-lumens">here</a>. In particular, get bulbs with a color temperature close to sunlight (5600k), but make sure the bulbs have a <span>good<span>good means 90+</span></span> Color Rendering Index (CRI), otherwise the light will feel harsh.</p>
<p>I recommend putting any bright lighting you buy for your home on electrical timers so you don’t accidentally leave them on during the evening and screw up your sleep. You may also want to set your phone/computer brightness on a timer, if you can. The goal is to mimic the natural day/night cycle of our evolutionary environment, but without all the pesky volatility of nature. You can get programs like f.lux too, which reduce the amount of blue light emitted by your device in the evening, but in my experience this isn’t good enough and reducing the actual brightness of the device at night is also important.</p>
<p>“But what about vitamin D? Just go outside!” This is terrible advice, and I hear it too often. Sunlight is a powerful carcinogen, and vitamin D supplements are not, and they’re cheap. </p>
<h3 id="carbon-dioxide">Carbon dioxide</h3>
<p>Carbon MON-oxide is the deadly one you probably already have a monitor for in your house. Carbon DI-oxide is the feeble cousin of carbon monoxide, but it still has a negative effect on human health: <span>high (but common)<span>1,000 ppm or higher</span></span> levels impairs our ability to think. Just what you don’t want in an office. High levels may also have a negative long-term impact in other areas of our health. </p>
<p>Hold your breath. When it sucks and you decide to start breathing again, it’s carbon dioxide buildup, not lack of oxygen, causing you to feel panic and the need to breath. Carbon dioxide is a toxin. And we breath it out into poorly ventilated rooms, where the levels can rise to double or triple what they are <span>outdoors<span>around 400 ppm</span></span>.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown significant (temporary) cognitive impairments due to carbon dioxide levels over 1,000 ppm, but such levels are <span>common<span>I recently bought a carbon dioxide meter and found such levels in my home.</span></span> in poorly ventilated shared spaces. Fortunately, the solution is simple: open a window. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work when it’s raining, or when it’s too hot outside, or when it’s too cold outside… In particular, I have to contend with Canadian winters, which means opening the window is a valid strategy for a minority of the year unless I buy an expensive heat recovery ventilator. I don’t have a good solution for mitigating carbon dioxide buildup in the winter. Let me know if you do.</p>
<p>And, by the way, plants won’t work. They won’t suck up nearly enough carbon dioxide. You would need hundreds of plants per person, or roughly a dozen full-size trees per person, to offset the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans in a room.</p>
<p>A fun fact: if we don’t stop pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, then in about a century, carbon dioxide <em>outdoors</em> may reach cognitively impairing levels. Then what do we do? </p>
<h3 id="temperature-and-humidity">Temperature and Humidity</h3>
<p>High/low humidity and high/low temperature both lead to discomfort and lower scores on concentration measures. People generally have temperature under control, or at least it’s something they’re aware of. Humidity is less common to measure, but a $10 hygrometer should help you get your indoor space to the ideal 30-50% humidity range if it isn’t already. Air conditioners also tend to reduce humidity as well as temperature, so air-condition in the summer and use a humidifier in the winter.</p>
<p>At night, drop the temperature a few degrees if you can; It’s easier to sleep in a cool room. I wonder how many hours of sleep have been reclaimed already due to the advent of smart thermostats.</p>
<h3 id="background-noise">Background Noise</h3>
<p>I imagine this factor is more subjective than the others, but too loud is distracting, even aggrivating; too quiet makes your sniffles and sighs painfully audible to others, and so is distracting. Uneven background noise like traffic is worse than the uniform background noise of white noise or trickling water. Bad background noise leads to poorer cognition and focus.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be bothered by noise and not realize it until the noise stops and a wave of relief finally makes you aware of how annoyed you were by the sound. Noise issues are happily easy to control: earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones will generally do the trick. It would be utopic to eliminate bothersome noise from the environment altogether, but it’s not necessary. </p>
<h3 id="segregation-of-activities">Segregation of Activities</h3>
<p>A heroin addict who normally takes their dose in their car decides one day to inject in their bathroom. They die of an overdose, even though they took the same amount they normally do. Why? Our brains maintain associations with different environments. If you normally inject heroin when you get in your car, then your body starts to prepare you for the drug as soon as you get in the car. Drug tolerance, then, is partly environmental. (This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196296/">actually happened</a> and happens regularly.) Your mind and body are affected by your environment due to Pavlovian conditioning. When the bell rings, the dog salivates. When the lunch bell rings, so do you. </p>
<p>One common piece of advice given by doctors to insomniacs is to only use your bed for sleeping and for sex, and it’s good advice. If you use your bed for reading, studying, and watching TV, then your mind will not form a strong association between the bed and sleep, and you will have a harder time falling asleep. </p>
<p>Likewise, if you do all your slacking off at the same desk you do your work at, you will probably have a harder time focusing. Even having your smartphone within your field of view while you work has been shown to reduce focus. So it wouldn’t hurt to have different areas for work and play, and to not eat at your desk. (And even different user accounts on your computer for work and non-work, if you don’t find that idea to be a pain in the ass like I do.)</p>
<p>We also form associations not just with space, but with time. Hence another piece of common sleep hygeine advice: go to sleep at the same time every night. Your body will learn to expect sleep at that time. Likewise, people who eat at the same time every day eat with their bodies prepared to receive food, and so are less likely to become obese. Studies have shown this. Unfortunately, setting every aspect of your life to a clock can make you feel like a robot, so I usually don’t tolerate such rigidity in my life. But it’s worth thinking about.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brighter lights for your poor eyes</li>
<li>Better ventilation for your poor lungs</li>
<li>Optimal temperature and humidity for your poor skin</li>
<li>Less distracting background noise for your poor ears</li>
<li>Activity-specific areas for your poor brain</li>
</ul>
<p>I also think the aesthetics of most of our indoor environments could use an upgrade, but I don’t have much to say on the subject besides simply saying so. (Though I would bet: green lush &gt; grey drab.)</p>
<p>We sometimes act like we are just <span>machines<span>caffeine in ⟶ code out</span></span>, but we are not. We’re mushy creatures with delicate bodies and delicate minds, too. And we evolved for one specific environment. There is no guarantee that the indoor environment which is cheapest to produce is going to be just as good for us as a bespoke imitation of our evolutionary environment, and in fact it is not. I think life would be more pleasant if people took these factors more serously when designing indoor environments, and our work would be more efficient and less prone to mistakes.</p>

<p>A recently published book in France warns about how digital devices are seriously affecting the neural development of children and young people.</p>
<p>The text is called <em>The digital cretin factory</em> and it was written by Michel Desmurget, director of research at the French National Institute of Health.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-54554333.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, the author of the work, which has become a bestseller in his country, assures that today’s young people are the first generation in history with a lower IQ than the previous one.</p>
<p>“Researchers have observed in many parts of the world that IQ increased from generation to generation.  This was called the ‘Flynn effect’, in reference to the American psychologist who described this phenomenon.  But recently, this trend began to be reversed in several countries ”, says the researcher.</p>
<p>“In those countries, digital natives are the first children to have a lower IQ than their parents.  It is a trend that has been documented in Norway, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, France, etc. ”.</p>
<p>Although the specific factors involved in this phenomenon have not yet been determined, it has been proven that the time a child spends in front of a screen would have an important effect on their IQ.</p>
<p>Thus, according to the author, when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development tend to decrease.</p>
<p>This would directly affect the main foundations of our intelligence, such as language, concentration, memory and culture in general, which would end up causing a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>
<p>According to Desmurget, dependence on screens and digital devices is associated with a decrease in the quality and quantity of family interactions, as well as a decrease in the time spent on other activities that can be more enriching.</p>
<p>Sleep disruption, overestimation of attention, intellectual under-stimulation (the brain cannot unfold its full potential) and the adoption of an excessively sedentary lifestyle are also involved.</p>
<p>Michel Desmurget, with studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of California, criticizes the enormous amount of time that today’s children spend in front of digital devices.</p>
<p>“On average, almost three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds and more than seven hours for adolescents,” he explains.</p>
<p>“This means that before reaching the age of 18, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!  It is simply crazy and irresponsible ”.</p>

<h2><a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, 28 October 2020</h2>


</header>

<p>There’s a proposal to add <em>Software Transactional Memory</em>, or <em>STM</em>, to the Ruby programming language. This is part of a wider effort to add better support for concurrency and parallelism in Ruby, and in particular the idea of <em>ractors</em>. A concept has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652">implemented</a> by Koichi Sasada.</p>

<figcaption>An animation of the algorithm we're going to use as an example of STM - we'll explain this later on</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This article gives some context on what STM is, how you use it, and why you might want to use it. We’ll show an application which is well-suited to STM and we’ll use this to talk about the benefits, issues, and some open questions.</p>

<p>We’ll finish by setting a challenge for STM in Ruby.</p>

<p>I wrote the first half of my PhD on STM, and the second half on Ruby, so I’ve got quite a bit of experience with both and the idea of their combination is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="why-might-we-want-an-stm">Why might we want an STM?</h2>

<p>Let’s say we’re a bank managing many bank accounts. Each account has a total. We get a never-ending stream of requests to move a sum of money <code>m</code> from an account <code>a</code> to account <code>b</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something not everyone may know about Ruby is that <code>x += y</code> is equivalent to writing <code>t = x; x = t + y</code>. We’ll write that out in full to make that clear to ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>a_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>a_balance</span> <span>-</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>b_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>b_balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve got a lot of transfers to run through, so we’ll have multiple threads processing these transfers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>a_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
      <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>a_balance</span> <span>-</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>b_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span>
      <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>b_balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve got a few problems here now. With all these threads running at the same time, what happens if two threads are putting money into your account concurrently?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>

<span># thread 1                        # thread 2</span>
<span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span># balance = 100</span>
                                  <span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
                                    <span># balance = 100</span>
<span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
  <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
                                  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
                                    <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two transfers have run, but your balance is 110. The other 10 has been lost - this is called a <em>lost update</em>, meaning it’s as if the update was never made.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens if the thread crashes after taking money from <code>a</code> but before putting it into <code>b</code>? The transfer would be applied partially and again we’d lose money.</p>

<p>We need to use some kind of <em>synchronization</em> on our accounts. Ruby has <em>mutual exclusion locks</em> or <em>mutexes</em>, so we can try using those.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Does this work? What if we process a transfer from account 1001 to account 1002 on one thread at the same time as processing a transfer from account 1002 to 1001, so the other way around, at the same time?</p>

<p>The first thread will try to lock 1001 and then 1002. The second thread will try to lock 1002 and then 1001. If the first thread gets as far as locking 1001, and the second as far as locking 1002, then both will be waiting for the opposite lock and will never release the lock they already have. We will be in <em>deadlock</em>.</p>

<p>If we always acquired locks in the same order, by collecting them up first and sorting them, we could fix this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>].</span><span>sort</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>y</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in both transfers account 1001 is locked first and 1002 is locked second. That will work.</p>

<p>We have to make up a somewhat artificial requirement to explain the next issue, but consider if for some good reason we wanted to transfer to one account if we had a lot of money, and a different account if we only had a little money. Maybe if we’re rich this month we donate to charity, otherwise we unfortunately need to save for ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if account balance &gt; 1000
  transfer 10 to charity
else
  transfer 10 to savings
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll talk about accounts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, now, and a threshold of money <code>t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>

<p>It’s starting to get very complicated. And this locks more than it needs to - it locks both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> but then only uses one of them. If you use <code>b</code> in the end, ideally another thread could be serving a transfer to <code>c</code> at the same time, but you’ve locked it and it can’t. Imagine if instead of two potential accounts it was thousands and you had to lock them all. Imagine if you couldn’t work out at all which account you’d be transferring to until you started the transfer - then you’d never be able to process two transfers at the same time.</p>

<p>At this point as well we’re likely to start to make errors trying to do all this locking and ordering of locks and things.</p>

<p>Stepping back and taking it all in, we can draw up some requirements for what we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>atomicity</em> - that all writes in the transfer are applied or none are applied</li>
  <li><em>consistency</em> - meaning that our data structures are always valid - the total sum of money never changes</li>
  <li><em>isolation</em> - meaning one transfer does not interfere with another</li>
  <li><em>durability</em> - meaning that when applied the transfer is available to all subsequent transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally a library or the language could do this all for us. We’d like to be able to write almost what we originally wrote, but with just an annotation to make the code inside a block atomic, consistent, isolated, and the result durable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what a <em>transactional</em> memory can let us do. It will automatically monitor what you read and write inside the <code>atomically</code> block, which is a <em>transaction</em>, and will make sure it is either applied fully or not, that the balance of the whole system is always consistent, that transactions do not see the result of each other partially applied, and that writes appear and stay.</p>

<p>It may be implemented using the code we eventually arrived at ourselves, or it could do something else instead. In practice how it is often implemented is that
reads and writes are stored in a log, then at the end the transaction works out if anyone else has written locations that you’ve read. If they have then the values you read are no longer valid, so your transaction <em>conflicts</em> with another, is <em>aborted</em> and retries, reading the locations again. When it eventually does not conflict with any other transactions it is <em>committed</em> and succeeds. This means you don’t need to lock everything up-front, which means you avoid the problem of what happens if you may potentially need every account. Locking everything up-front is called <em>pessimistic locking</em>. We’re moving to <em>optimistic locking</em></p>

<h2 id="the-proposed-stm">The proposed STM</h2>

<p>Koichi’s <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> STM for Ruby, in combination with his proposed <em>ractors</em> (similar to <em>actors</em>) would look like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span> <span>=</span> <span>9999</span><span>.</span><span>times</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>Thread</span><span>::</span><span>TVar</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>*</span><span>accounts</span> <span>do</span> <span>|*</span><span>accounts</span><span>|</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>value</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>He’s using a <code>Ractor</code> but you can think of it as a thread for the purposes of this article. Instead of an array of account balances, we now have an array of <code>TVar</code> objects that contain values. A <code>TVar</code> is a <em>transactional variable</em>. Only these variables are transactional - not any other Ruby value you read or write. His design requires that the <code>TVar</code> objects you’re going to use are passed into the <code>Ractor</code>, due to rules about sharing that aren’t relevant for this article.</p>

<p>This looks good, doesn’t it!</p>

<h2 id="a-more-complex-application">A more complex application</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a larger application, in order to illustrate further and to talk about some issues and open questions. The <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/ruby-stm-lee-demo">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s our job to lay out the wires on a circuit board. We get a board with <em>pads</em> (connections to components mounted on the board) and a list of <em>routes</em> that we need to draw between these pads. There are a great many pads and routes, there isn’t much space on the tiny board, and another catch is that it’s very expensive to have wires crossing each other. Let’s say it’s exponentially more expensive for more deeply stacked wires.</p>

<img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/ruby-stm/minimal.svg" width="25%">
<figcaption>A minimal board and a solution</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this minimal example we we can see two routes, and how they have to cross each other.</p>

<p>This example is a processor module and shows what kind of scale we might want to be working at. This board has many longer routes which are more likely to conflict.</p>

<p>This example is a memory module. It has many shorter routes which we may expect to conflict less.</p>

<p>We’ll use this test board, which is somewhere between all these extremes.</p>

<p>There’s an algorithm to lay each routes, and it actually produces an optimal solution for an individual route, but not for all routes. It’s called <em>Lee’s algorithm</em> and was published back in 1960. We’ll …</p></article></div>

    <p>Perhaps you've read posts like <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</a>

<p>Addressing is a fertile ground for incorrect assumptions, because everyone's used to dealing with addresses and 99% of the time they seem so simple.
Below are some incorrect assumptions I've seen made, or made myself, or had reported to me.
(If you want to look up an address for a UK postcode or vice-versa to confirm what I'm telling you, try the <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/postcode-finder/">Royal Mail Postcode Finder</a>)</p>

<!-- Composition of building numbers -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>An address will start with, or at least include, a building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there is a building number, it will be all-numeric.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p>

<p>4-5 Bonhill Street, London, EC2A 4BX</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No buildings are numbered zero</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at the very least no buildings have negative numbers</strong></p>

<p>Guy Chisholm provided this counterexample: Minusone Priory Road, Newbury, RG14 7QS</p>

<p>(none of the databases I've checked render this as -1)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We can put those funny numbers into the building name field, as no buildings have both a name and a funny number</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Idas Court, 4-6 Princes Road, Hull, HU5 2RD</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a building name, there won't be a building number (or vice-versa)</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building number will only be used once per street</strong></p>

<p>The difference between 50 Ammanford Road, Tycroes, Ammanford, SA18 3QJ and 50 Ammanford Road, Llandybie, Ammanford, SA18 3YF is about 4 miles (<a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=SA18+3QJ+to+SA18+3YF">Google Maps</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's line with a number in an address, it's the building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 18, Da Vinci House, 44 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8FH, United Kingdom</p>

<p>You also get suite numbers, floor numbers, unit numbers, and organisations with numbers in their names.</p>

<p>Adrien Piérard contributes an address from Japan with fifteen digits in six separate numbers (five if you count the zip code as a single number). The format is: 980-0804 (zip code), Miyagi-ken (prefecture) Sendai-shi (city) Aoba-ku (ward) Kokubuncho (district) 4-10-20 (sub-district-number block-number lot-number) Sendai (building name) 401 (flat number).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, the first line starting with a number then</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 3 Store, 311-318 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building will only have one number</strong></p>

<p>Benton Lam offers this address from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - it has both a number on its road (14) and in its group of buildings (3): 15/F, Cityplaza 3, 14 TaiKoo Wan Road, Island East, HKSAR</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The number of buildings is the difference between the highest and lowest building numbers</strong></p>

<p>Tibor Schütz points out building numbers may be skipped - for example, on a street where even-numbered buildings are on one side, odd numbers on the other; multiple buildings sharing the same number (such as where a new house has been built) and buildings with more than one number.</p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov and Sami Lehtinen tell me in Antibes, France and rural Finland some buildings are numbered based on the distance from the start of the road - such as Longroad 65 for the building 750m from the start of longroad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If the addresses on the left of the road are even, the addresses on the right must be odd</strong></p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov points out that in places, <a href="https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=48.857415,2.467167">Boulevard Théophile Sueur, Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France</a> has evens-only on both sides. The two sides are also in different cities and Départements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building name won't also be a number</strong></p>

<p>Ben Tilly reports on Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA - which is not, reportedly, the same as 10 Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at least you can omit leading zeros</strong></p>

<p>Shaun Crampton reports living at 101 Alma St, Apartment 001, Palo Alto - where apartments 1 and 001 were on different floors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A street with a building A will not also have a building Alpha</strong></p>

<p>Douglas Perreault reports he lived in a block within a condo association; it was a large association, with blocks A through Z then Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta. Mail and deliveries were often misrouted from block Alpha to block A and vice-versa. His address at the time was: 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Composition of street names -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A street name won't include a number</strong></p>

<p>8 Seven Gardens Burgh, WOODBRIDGE, IP13 6SU (pointed out by Raphael Mankin)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but numbers in street names are expressed as words, not digits</strong></p>

<p>Jan Jongboom reports streets can be numbered in the Netherlands - for example, Plein 1944 in Nijmegen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a numbered street and a house number, there will be a separator between them</strong></p>

<p>Another from Jan Jongboom: Gondel 2695, Lelystad, means area Gondel, street 26, number 95</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names always end in descriptors like 'street', 'avenue', 'drive', 'square', 'hill' or 'view'</strong></p>

<p>They don't always - for example: Piccadilly, London, W1J 9PN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor there will only be one</strong></p>

<p>A street name can be entirely descriptors: 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Road">Avenue Road, Toronto, Ontario</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor it will be at the end</strong></p>

<p>French addresses use prefix descriptors like 'rue', 'avenue', 'place' and 'allee'.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but if there's a descriptor it'll be at the start or end of the street name.</strong></p>

<p>Or the middle, like 3 Bishops Square Business Park, Hatfield, AL10 9NA</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but at the very least you wouldn't name a town Street</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Street,+Somerset">Actually there's a town called Street in Somerset, UK</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street numbers (and building numbers) don't contain fractions</strong></p>

<p>Dan, Fred Kroon, David Underwood and Daniel Dickison submitted examples of fractional street numbers like <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=43rd%20%C2%BD%20st,%20Pittsburgh,%20PA">43rd ½ St, Pittsburgh, PA</a>, and of fractional building numbers. These can be written in unicode (43rd ½ St), as a fraction with a slash (43 1/2) or as a decimal (43.5)</p>

<p>Gene Wirchenko reports a fractional building number: 1313 1/2 Railroad Ave Bellingham WA 98225-4729</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names don't recurr in the same city</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=from:W3+6LJ+to:W5+5DB+to:N8+7PB+to:SE25+6EP+to:E13+0AJ+to:E17+7LD+to:NW10+4LX+to:N1+9TR+to:E1+6PG+to:NW1+0JH+to:W14+8NL+to:SE13+6AD+to:SW19+5DX+to:E11+2AJ+to:SW19+2AE+to:E6+2HJ+&amp;saddr=W3+6LJ&amp;daddr=W5+5DB+to:N8+7PB+to:SE25+6EP+to:E13+0AJ+to:E17+7LD+to:NW10+4LX+to:N1+9TR+to:E1+6PG+to:NW1+0JH+to:W14+8NL+to:SE13+6AD+to:SW19+5DX+to:E11+2AJ+to:SW19+2AE+to:E6+2HJ">Here's a map of the following addresses:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>High Street, London, W3 6LJ</li>
<li>High Street, London, W5 5DB</li>
<li>High Street, London, N8 7PB</li>

<li>High Street Colliers Wood, London, SW19 2AE</li>
<li>High Street North, London, E6 2HJ </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>But street names don't recurr in close proximity</strong></p>

<p>Julian Fleischer provides an example from Bocholt in Germany showing several roads in close proximity all called <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.853945,6.615334">Up de Welle</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An address will be comprised of road names</strong></p>

<p>Kirk Kerekes spent several years using an address of the form "2 mi N then 3 mi W of Jennings, OK 74038" which regularly got successful deliveries. Mike Riley used to mail the Very Large Array radio telescope at "50 miles (80 km) West of Socorro, New Mexico, USA"</p>

<p>Sam pointed me to <a href="http://www.menomoneefallsnow.com/news/99857214.html">Menomonee Falls</a> where houses are addressed using Milwaukee County's grid system instead of house numbers - giving addresses like N88 W16541 Foobar St.</p>

<p>Andy Monat sent the following address example, from a <a href="http://ciapa.tulane.edu/uploads/1_EE_2012_Acceptance_Packet_INFORMATION-1340749206.pdf">semester abroad program at Tulane University </a>: CIAPA, 50 meters north of the Hypermas/Walmart of Curridabat, San Jose, Costa Rica. Adrien Piérard and Luke Allardyce point out street names are seldom used in Japan - instead, districts and blocks and lot numbers are used (more info on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">Wikipedia entry for the Japanese addressing system</a>).  A <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/592.cfm">2002 World Press Review report</a> gave this sample address: From where the Chinese restaurant used to be, two blocks down, half a block toward the lake, next door to the house where the yellow car is parked, Managua, Nicaragua. Shaun Crampton sent <a href="https://vianica.com/nicaragua/practical-info/14-addresses.html">an article with more details and examples of the Nicaraguan system</a>. Stig Brautaset pointed out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14806350">a BBC article about post in Kabul</a> gives this example: "Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace". Nathan Fellman reports similar addressing is used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Paul Puschmann and Tibor Schütz pointed out the city of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratestadt">Mannheim in Germany is sometimes called Quadratestadt (City of Squares)</a> as the city centre is arranged in a grid, with blocks assigned a letter (along the north-south axis) and a number (along the east-west axis) then buildings numbered by block number. So an example address at numbers 6 to 13 on block R 5 would be: Institut für Deutsche Sprache, R 5, 6-13, D-68161 Mannheim </p>

<p>Leoni Lubbinge gives an example of a South African address: Part 84, Strydfontein 306 JR, Pretoria which means the 84th plot of the farm Strydfontein 306 JR.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A road will have a name</strong></p>

<p>Plenty of roads like driveways, onramps and the aisles of carparks don't have names. Some roads in Japan also don't have names, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">the prevalent addressing system works on districts, subdistricts, blocks, lots and lot numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Peter Kenway points out in America some homes are addressed as Rural Routes, where numbers are allocated to boxes on a route covering multiple roads. For example: Box 1234, R.R. 1, Winthrop, ME 04364.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A road will only have one name</strong></p>

<p>Many different roads, from Goswell Road in London to Regent Road in Edinburgh, make up the 410 mile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_road_%28Great_Britain%29">A1</a>. And while there may only be one "1 Goswell Road" and only one "1 Regent Road" there are multiple buildings numbered 1 on the road designated A1.</p>

<p>Roads may also be named in multiple languages. For example, in Ireland roads may be named in both English and Irish</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Addresses will only have one street</strong></p>

<p>The Royal Mail have what they call a 'dependent street' - for example: 6 Elm Avenue, Runcorn Road, Birmingham, B12 8QX, United Kingdom (Runcorn Road is the street, Elm Avenue is the stubby 'dependent street' and isn't unique within the city. <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=B12+8QX">Google Maps</a> )</p>

<p>Another counterexample: Rogue Hair, 1 Hopton Parade, Streatham High Road, London, SW16 …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p><span>Written: 28 Oct 2020 by <i>Jeremy Howard</i></span></p><blockquote>
<p><em>Update Oct 20, 2020</em>: NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.org/blog/jeremy-howard-apology">has apologized</a> to me. I accept their apology. I do not accept their assertion that “At the time of the interview, the committee had not determined that there was a violation of the code of conduct, only that there were two complaints filed and being examined.” The email to set up the call said “We would like to schedule a meeting so that we can discuss the results of our investigation with you” - nothing further. During the call, the committee stated the list of violations, and said “that is what the reporters stated, and what we found”. I asked why they didn’t take a statement from me before that finding, and they said “we all watched the video, so we could see for ourselves the violation”. The committee offered in their apology email to me to have a follow-up discussion, and I declined the offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: NumFOCUS found I violated their Code of Conduct (CoC) at JupyterCon because my talk was not “kind”, because I said Joel Grus was “wrong” regarding his opinion that Jupyter Notebook is not a good software development environment. Joel (who I greatly respect, and consider an asset to the data science community) was not involved in NumFOCUS’s action, was not told about it, and did not support it. NumFOCUS did not follow their own enforcement procedure and violated their own CoC, left me hanging for over a week not even knowing what I was accused of, and did not give me an opportunity to provide input before concluding their investigation. I repeatedly told their committee that my emotional resilience was low at the moment due to medical issues, which they laughed about and ignored, as I tried (unsuccessfully) to hold back tears. The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In my recent JupyterCon keynote, “I Like Jupyter Notebooks” (re-recording provided at the bottom of this post, if you’re interested in seeing it for yourself), I sought to offer a rebuttal to Joel Grus’ highly influential JupyterCon presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a>”. Joel claimed in his talk that Jupyter is a poor choice for software development and teaching, and I claimed in my talk that it is a good choice. The NumFOCUS committee found me guilty of violating their code of conduct for having not been “kind” in my disagreement with Joel, and for “insulting” him. The specific reasons given were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I said that Joel Grus was “wrong”</li>
<li>I used some of his slides (properly attributed) and a brief clip from one of his videos to explain why I thought he was wrong</li>
<li>That I made “a negative reference” to his prior talk</li>
<li>I was also told that “as a keynote speaker” I would “be held to a higher standard than others” (although this was not communicated to me prior to my talk, nor what that higher standard is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Code of Conducts can be a useful tool, when thoughtfully created and thoughtfully enforced, to address sexism, racism, and harassment, all of which have been problems at tech conferences. Given the <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996">diversity issues in the tech industry</a>, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds. Having a code of conduct with explicit rules against violent threats, unwelcome sexual attention, repeated harassment, sexually explicit pictures, and other harmful behavior is the first step towards addressing and stopping those behaviors. The JupyterCon code provides the following examples of unacceptable behavior, none of which are at all similar to what I did (i.e. saying that someone was wrong on a technical topic, and explaining how and why):</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience with the NumFOCUS code of conduct raises a few key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CoC enforcement process involved conflicting &amp; changing information, no opportunity for me to give input, the stress of a long wait of unknown duration with no information about what I was accused of or what would happen next, and the committee members violated their own CoC during the process</li>
<li>There were two totally different Codes of Conduct with different requirements linked in different places</li>
<li>I was held to a different, undocumented and uncommunicated standard</li>
<li>The existence of, or details about, the CoC were not communicated prior to confirmation of the engagement</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend avoiding requirements of politeness or other forms of “proper” behavior, but should focus on a specific list of unacceptable behaviors. The JupyterCon CoC, however, is nearly entirely a list of “proper” behaviors (such as “Be welcoming”, “Be considerate”, and “Be friendly”) that are vaguely defined</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend using a CoC that focuses on a list of unacceptable behaviors. Both the codes linked to JupyterCon have such a link, and none of the unacceptable behavior examples are in any way related or close to what happened in this case. But NumFOCUS nonetheless found me in violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not have to write this post at all. However I know that people will ask about why my talk isn’t available on the JupyterCon site, so I felt that I should explain exactly what happened. In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”). Finally, I found that being on the “other side” of a code of conduct issue gave me additional insights into the process, and that it’s important that I should share those insights to help the community in the future.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The rest of this post is a fairly detailed account of what happened, for those that are interested.</p>
<h3 id="my-talk-at-jupytercon">My talk at JupyterCon</h3>
<p>I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://jupytercon.com/">JupyterCon</a>. My partner Rachel gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frc7FgheUj4">talk at JupyterCon</a> a couple of years ago, and had a wonderful experience, and I’m a huge fan of Jupyter, so I wanted to support the project. The conference used to be organized by O’Reilly, who have always done a wonderful job of conferences I’ve attended, but this year the conference was instead handled by <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.</p>
<p>For my talk, I decided to focus on Jupyter as a literate and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">exploratory programming environment</a>, using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>. One challenge, however, is that two years earlier Joel Grus had given a brilliant presentation called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a> which had been so compelling that I have found it nearly impossible to talk about programming in Jupyter without being told “you should watch this talk which explains why programming in Jupyter is a terrible idea”.</p>
<p>Joel opened and closed his presentation with some light-hearted digs at me, since I’d asked him ahead of time <em>not</em> to do such a presentation. So I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone, and take the opportunity to respond directly to him. Not only was his presentation brilliant, but his slides were hilarious, so I decided to directly parody his talk by using (with full credit of course) some of his slides directly. That way people that hadn’t seen his talk could both get to enjoy the fantastic content, and also understand just what I was responding to. For instance, here’s how Joel illustrated the challenge of running cells in the right order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png">
</figure>
<p>I showed that slide, explaining that it’s Joel’s take on the issue, and then followed up with a slide showing how easy it actually is to run all cells in order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png">
</figure>
<p>Every slide included a snippet from Joel’s title slide, which, I explained, showed which slides were directly taken from his presentation. I was careful to ensure I did not modify any of his slides in any way. When first introducing his presentation, I described Joel as “a brilliant communicator, really funny, and wrong”. I didn’t make any other comments about Joel (although, for the record, I think he’s awesome, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130">his book</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-of-conduct-violation-notice">The Code of Conduct violation notice</h3>
<p>A week later, I received an email telling me that two CoC reports were filed regarding my JupyterCon keynote presentation. I was told that “The Code of Conduct Enforcement Team is meeting tomorrow to review the incident and will be contacting you to inform you of the nature of the report and to understand your perspective”.</p>
<p>The CoC wasn’t mentioned at all until after I’d been invited to speak, had accepted, and had completed the online registration. I had reviewed it at that time, and had been a bit confused. The email I received linked to a <a href="https://jupytercon.com/codeofconduct/">JupyterCon Code of Conduct</a>, but that in turn didn’t provide much detail about what is and isn’t OK, and that in turn linked to a different <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>. A link was also provided to <a href="https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT">report violations</a>, which also linked to and named the NumFOCUS CoC.</p>
<p>I was concerned that I had done something which might be viewed as a violation, and looked forward to hearing about the nature of the report and having a chance to share my perspective. I was heartened that JupyterCon documented that they follow the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct/response-and-enforcement-events-meetups">NumFOCUS Enforcement Manual</a>. I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3 id="smart-code-splitting">Smart code splitting</h3><p>No matter which page your user lands on, the total footprint of a Remix app is about 50kb over the network (including dependencies). It doesn't matter how large your application gets, each page only downloads what it needs, which is actually pretty uncommon in the React ecosystem.</p><p>React apps are typically built two ways: bundle everything into one enormous file (yikes!) or code split into multiple bundles to load on demand. The apps that code split usually send down a very large build manifest, listing every asset you could possibly need. That means as you add files and pages to your site, the footprint of <em>every page</em> grows.</p><p>Remix never loads more code than the page the user is looking at. You can have 10 or 10,000 routes, the footprint for each remains constant. Just because you added some routes to the photo viewer doesn't mean the contact page gets bigger over the network.</p><h3 id="beyond-heavy-javascript-in-the-browser">Beyond heavy JavaScript in the browser</h3><p>Do you ever look at some of the pages on your website and think "why does this need to download any JavaScript at all?". We do too. Go ahead and open the dev tools on this page you're reading right now.</p><p>Yeah, you, open the dev tools.</p><p>That's right, no JavaScript! This is a marketing page with nothing interactive but links. There's no reason to load JavaScript here. You might think "but wouldn't you be able to speed up the transitions if you loaded in a client side router?" Great question. The answer is, not always.</p><p>Open the devtools again. You'll note in the network tab that we've already loaded in the "/buy" page with a link response header. When you click "buy" (please click buy), the browser already has the page and will navigate there immediately. It can't get faster than that.</p><p>With Remix, you have full control of how your app is delivered at every route. Load a bunch of JavaScript for a really interactive page, or skip it for a static page. Preload a page you think they'll navigate to, or only load that page when they navigate to it. It's all up to you.</p><h3 id="closing-the-gap-between-production-and-development-builds">Closing the gap between production and development builds</h3><p>Remember that one time you were implementing dark mode and put a <code>window.matchMedia</code> in state? Remember how everything was awesome until you deployed and then suddenly the production server was crashing? That's right, there is no window on the server and you weren't server rendering in dev!</p><p>Remember when you pushed some new CSS to production and your elements started bouncing around because your CSS lib was moving style tags around in production but not dev?</p><p>Remember when the requests for code split resources in development seemed fine but in production they were widly different and included way more in them than expected?</p><p>Production bugs live in the delta between development and production environments. Remix closes that gap.</p><p>Remix server renders the same in development as production, loads CSS the same (<code>&lt;link/&gt;</code>, ofc) and code splits the same. How can we do this? We only build the page you're looking at in development, so we can build it like production in a few milliseconds.</p><h3 id="a-refreshing-take-on-css">A refreshing take on CSS</h3><p>Remix lets you use the CSS skills you already have.

        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<p>2020-10-26</p>

<p>For some weeks now I've been fantasizing about creating this blog. I've thought about creating an HTTP server from scratch just to serve it on a Linode instance, writing a static blog engine to generate the HTML from Markdown, besides every other kinds of over-engineering just for fun.</p>

<p>I've also compiled a list with a dozen blogs I enjoy the most. Then I've tried to distill what are their qualities that makes me enjoy them, and how I may achieve those in my own blog.</p>

<p>Well, as you may see, this is my first post. Doing all of the above lead me to not start any blog at all.</p>

<p>This may be called "analysis paralysis", "over-engineering" or "perfect is the enemy of the good". Whatever it may be, I'm done with it now.</p>

<p>The most valuable thing is to produce something and put it out in the world. All the planning, engineering, thinking exists just to support that. With no realization, no "getting started", ultimately there's no value to be generated at all.</p>

<p>This is obvious in hindsight, but it's very easy to forget this lesson.</p>

<p>So, what have <em>you</em> been putting off through planning and fantasizing? What is keeping you from just <em>doing</em> what you want to do? Can't you get started right now or are you avoiding it by doing easier things? And by doing what you are doing, are you generating any value for yourself or for anyone?</p>

<p>2020-10-26</p>

<p>The <em>Growth Mindset</em> research is one of the most impacting developments of cognitive psychology. Spearheaded by the decades of research of the psychologist Carol Dweck, it reveals how our <em>beliefs</em> about intelligence and skill shape our performance.</p>

<p>This research brilliantly sidesteps the long debate of "nature vs nurture", or how much are our intelligence, talent or skill brought up by our intrinsic genes or by our extrinsic environment and actions. The focus is on the <em>belief</em> itself that the individual holds.</p>

<p>Dweck has shown that individuals with a <em>Growth Mindset</em>, that believe that intelligence can be developed and skill is acquired through effortful practice, end up being more successful. This happens because such individuals tend to embrace challenges, push out of their zone of comfort and accept negative feedback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, individuals with a <em>Fixed Mindset</em>, that believe that intelligence is bestowed upon birth and not developed thereafter, end up being less successful. They tend to deal worse with setbacks, seeing failures as permanent testaments of their limitations. Because of this, they tend to avoid new situations and challenges above their level of skill. As a self-fulfilling prophecy, they end up not further developing their skills.</p>

<p>Dweck has also shown that we are strongly biased towards a Fixed Mindset, but with conscious effort it is possible to rewire ourselves to be more oriented towards a Growth Mindset. The psychologist has urged parents and teachers to instill in kids a Growth Mindset by praising the effort they put in instead of seemingly natural intelligence or talent.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FCKPHG/">"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"</a> is a great read and goes into details of how the Growth Mindset was studied and how one can become more growth-oriented.</p>

<p>To see it in action, we declare an enum of all possible actions.
Of course, these can be way more complicated in the real world use-case.</p>

chain<span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>actions<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then generate a few actions.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>for</span> action <span>in</span> chain<span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>take</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"## New session ##"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> action<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which gives us the following output.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span><span data-user="root" data-host="localhost"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span>cargo run --example traffic

DeleteTodo

SignIn
ListTodos
CreateTodo
CreateTodo
CreateTodo
DeleteTodo</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how after each <code>SignIn</code> there's a <code>ListTodos</code>, which means <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>I</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(ListTodos|SignIn)=1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Built model can represent inherent rules of our application.
Some series of actions will not be generated, those having probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which is a lot better than uniformly generated random data.</p>
<p>Some combination of actions might not be possible, because they'd break business rules.
Those can be filtered out, or left in to test invalid requests.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>For founders, this question comes up a lot:</p><blockquote>“I have too many startup ideas. I don’t know which idea to focus on.”</blockquote><p>It certainly did for me. </p><p>I have been building SaaS products for the last few years, with bad to mediocre results. Each one taught me something new. Each one revealed one or two factors about the idea that I wish I knew BEFORE working on it.</p><p>For example, if there is a HUGE population with the problem I'm solving, then there's a better chance of me surviving despite incumbents and competitors. Larger pie, more slices to go round.</p><p>If I had known how to evaluate these ideas beforehand, I would have saved a lot of time. It won't be a guarantee of success, but it would have helped increase my odds.</p><p>I wanted to know what else I should know before starting work on an idea, so I researched articles, podcasts and videos with successful founders to find out how they evaluate ideas.</p><p>The result is a <strong>30-point checklist</strong>, curated from over 40 founders, that I want to share with you below. </p><p>Having a list makes it easy, and even fun, to evaluate your ideas in a structured and repeatable way. Think of it as <strong>due diligence</strong> you're doing before investing your time in your idea.</p><h2 id="but-ideas-don-t-matter-execution-does-">"But ideas don't matter. Execution does!"</h2><p>The intention of this advice is good, but, I feel this is misleading.</p><p>Given two ideas, executing on the one that has a better chance of succeeding will yield better results. Executing on a bad idea wastes time, money, and motivation.</p><p>Would you not want to know if an idea is a "good idea" before you spend lots of time and money trying to validate it?</p><p>If you think evaluating an idea before investing time and money in it isn't practical, then tell that to angel investors. They have to - they can't afford to give away money based on hunches. In their world, it's called due diligence.</p><blockquote>"Ideas mean everything and nothing at the same time. They mean everything, because you can 10x your odds of success by simply picking a better one. They mean nothing, because with bad execution you'll achieve nothing, no matter how good the idea." — Alex West, <a href="http://cyberleads.co/">cyberleads.co</a></blockquote><h2 id="the-saas-idea-evaluation-checklist">The SaaS idea evaluation checklist</h2><p>So here's the list I'm using. I have grouped them into 3 groups:</p><ul><li>Must-haves: Don't even start without having all of these.</li><li>Should-haves: The more you have of these, the better your chances.</li><li>Nice-to-haves: Not essential, but really helps if you do have them.</li></ul><h3 id="must-haves">Must-haves</h3><p>1. <strong>Solves a very specific problem</strong>. What's the specific problem you are aiming to solve?</p><p>2. <strong>Targets a very specific niche</strong>. Which specific group of people has that problem?</p><p>3. <strong>Has a large enough market</strong>. How big is this market? Is it enough to meet your business goal? A large market also means there's room for competitors.</p><p>4. <strong>Will generate profit</strong>. How much will it cost to run this business, and will you be able to turn a profit? Obvious, but a surprising number of founders don't work this out until much later!</p><p>5. <strong>Can operate profitably without the founder</strong>. Can this business grow profitably without you?</p><h3 id="should-haves">Should-haves</h3><p>6. <strong>Solves my own problem</strong>. Are you building this for yourself? Great start if you are!</p><p>7. <strong>"Hair on fire" problem</strong>. Will your customers need your solution urgently? Or is it not that important?</p><p>8. <strong>Frequently occurring problem</strong>. How often does someone have this problem? Hourly, daily, or at most weekly, would be best.</p><p>9. <strong>Growing market with this problem</strong>. More and more people are having this problem every day. More and more people will want your solution.</p><p>10. <strong>This is a mandatory problem</strong>. For example, this there's been a change in law and your customers need a solution. Like GDPR.</p><p>11. <strong>Customers are small businesses</strong>. These are the best customers to have because they have money, are motivated to spend, and has short lead times.</p><p>12. <strong>Founder has built an audience in target group</strong>. Do you already have followers or subscribers that have this problem.</p><p>13. <strong>Can be launched quickly</strong>. The faster you can launch, the quicker you can learn, and the quicker you get to revenue.</p><p>14. <strong>Clear customer acquisition channel</strong>. You can think of at least one obvious way to reach your target customers and offer your solution.</p><p>15. <strong>Founder - market fit</strong>. Do you know this market well?</p><p>16. <strong>Founder - product fit</strong>. Are you the right person to create this solution? Do you need to build a team?</p><p>17. <strong>Founder unfair advantage</strong>. Are you one of only a handful of people who can build on this idea? E.g. you own a patent.</p><p>18. <strong>You love serving this market</strong>. Will you enjoy talking to and serving this group of customers day in and day out?
