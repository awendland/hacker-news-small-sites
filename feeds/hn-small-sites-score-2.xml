                <p><strong>LONDON –</strong> Britain today became the first Western country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for general use as it announced a rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech's drug from next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for use," the Health Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week," the statement said. Priority groups will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>After months of "rigorous" clinical trials and thorough analysis of the data, the MHRA "concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness", the statement added.</p>

<p>"To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS (National Health Service) to do its work without being overwhelmed."</p>

<p>Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said it was a "historic moment in the fight against Covid-19".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK," he said.</p>

<p>Pfizer and BioNTech added that they expected further regulatory decisions from other countries "in the coming days and weeks".</p>

<p>The announcement came as England exited a month-long coronavirus lockdown, but most of the country remained under restrictions as a new regional system for cutting infection rates kicked in.</p>

<p>The four-week lockdown, which began last month, was imposed to stop surging rates of infection, ease pressure on health services, and to allow families to gather for Christmas.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Covid survivor, succeeded in winning a vote on the measures in parliament late yesterday, despite significant opposition within his own Conservative ranks.</p>

<p>"All we need to do now is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp and indeed being injected into our arms," he told lawmakers before the vote.</p>

<p>Until then "we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter", he warned. – AFP, December 2, 2020</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <div>
      
            
      <p>Our mission to secure the world’s connected devices got a timely boost when the US Senate passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr1668/BILLS-116hr1668eh.pdf" target="_blank">Internet of Things (“IoT”) Cybersecurity Improvement Act (H.R. 1668)</a> into law. This is the brainchild of Congresswoman Robin Kelly from Illinois.
The legislation provides for the establishment of a minimum set of cybersecurity standards for government purchased, internet connected devices.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been directed through the legislation to provide standards and guidelines for the  federal government agencies to comply with in order to better  manage the security of their IOT devices. These standards and guidelines are designed to provide a high level of continuity and more progress on the work already done by these agencies to address considerations around vulnerability detection, identity management, patching and the configuration of their IOT devices. </p>
<p><em>Don’t comply, Fed won’t buy</em></p>
<p>There is also a procurement dimension to the legislation and the law will require federal purchasers to apply restrictions on the purchase of devices from vendors who do not meet the NIST standards and guidelines. There are waivers in certain instances such as national security or research purposes, but the general rule will apply greater discipline to the treatment of security in product design and sale. This is obviously going to have a very big impact on manufacturers in the private sector who will need to meet these requirements to sell into federal government departments. There is likely to be an overspill effect into broader industrial and consumer electronics markets as the government starts to stand up and take IoT device security at all levels very seriously.</p>
<p><em>Get out of the kitchen if you can’t take the heat</em></p>
<p>It’s timely that in a <a href="https://mender.io/blog/good-news-the-u-s-house-passes-the-iot-cybersecurity-bill" target="_blank">recent blog post</a> our CEO Thomas Ryd noted that with these new IOT cybersecurity regulations being introduced, vendors who have not placed security at the center of their product development strategies will have to take a serious look at what they are doing, if they want to stay relevant and competitive in the market. </p>
<p>The <strong>Triangle of Trust</strong> is the strategic framework that guides product strategy and development at Northern.tech and Mender. We educate our customers to put this principle at the centre of their connected device management strategy. </p>
<p>Only <strong> authorised people</strong> can deploy <strong>authorised software</strong> to <strong>authorised devices</strong>. </p>
<p>Which leads to</p>
<p>Only the <strong> right people</strong> deploying the <strong>right software</strong> to the <strong>right devices</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Security in action in our IOT</em></p>
<p>We have developed the security features and strategic partnerships to translate this principle into operational reality for our customers. This puts us at the forefront of the market. For example, we work with NXP to support hardware encryption on their iMx gateway processors. This means that a device is highly secure from tampering with and malicious take over attempts. We also support Mutual TLS handshakes and PKP certificates and align to enterprise security standards and policies. We also consider less complex gateway devices and support elliptic curve cryptography for resource-efficient security and protection. </p>
<p>We thank Congresswoman Kelly for progressing and enacting this important legislation with fellow legislators in the US Senate. We believe that we are a provider that has prepared for this day, and have anticipated the requirements knowing that it was in the best interests of the customers we serve to make sure their devices avoid malicious attacks. </p>

    <p>It's 2020. Quarantines are everywhere – and here I'm writing about one, too.
But this quarantine is of a different kind.</p>

<p>In this article I'll describe the <strong>Linux Kernel Heap Quarantine</strong> that I developed
for mitigating kernel use-after-free exploitation. I will also summarize
the discussion about the prototype of this security feature on the Linux Kernel
Mailing List (LKML).</p>



<p>Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are very popular for
exploitation. There are many exploit examples, some of them include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/607">CVE-2016-8655</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/26/2">CVE-2017-6074</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">CVE-2017-2636</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-linux-kernel-af_packet-use-after-free/">CVE-2017-15649</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2020/02/15/CVE-2019-18683.html">CVE-2019-18683</a></li>
</ul>

<p>UAF exploits usually involve <strong>heap spraying</strong>.
Generally speaking, this technique aims to put attacker-controlled bytes at a defined memory
location on the heap. Heap spraying for exploiting UAF in the
Linux kernel relies on the fact that when <code>kmalloc()</code> is called, the slab
allocator returns the address of memory that was recently freed:</p>

<p>So allocating a kernel object with the same size and attacker-controlled
contents allows overwriting the vulnerable freed object:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png" width="70%"></a></center>


<p>Note: Heap spraying for out-of-bounds exploitation is a separate technique.</p>



<p>In July 2020, I got an idea of how to break this heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation. In August I found some time to try it out. I extracted the slab
freelist quarantine from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html">KASAN</a> functionality and called it <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>.</p>

<p>If this feature is enabled, freed allocations are stored in the quarantine
queue, where they wait to be actually freed. So there should be no way for them
to be instantly reallocated and overwritten by UAF exploits.
In other words, with <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>, the kernel allocator behaves like so:</p>

<p>On August 13, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/08/13/7">I sent</a> the first early PoC to LKML and started deeper research of
its security properties.</p>



<p>For researching the security properties of the kernel heap quarantine, I developed
two <code>lkdtm</code> tests (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/7">code is available here</a>).</p>

<p>The first test is called <code>lkdtm_HEAP_SPRAY</code>. It allocates and frees an object
from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then allocates 400,000 similar objects.
In other words, this test attempts an original heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation:</p>

        <span>...</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"FAIL: attempt %lu: freed object is reallocated</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is disabled, the freed object is instantly
reallocated and overwritten:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000002b5b3ad4 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: FAIL: attempt 0: freed object is reallocated
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is enabled, 400,000 new allocations don't overwrite
the freed object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000009909e777 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That happens because pushing an object through the quarantine requires <strong>both
allocating and freeing memory</strong>. Objects are released from the quarantine as
new memory is allocated, but only when the quarantine size is over the limit.
And the quarantine size grows when more memory is freed up.</p>

<p>That's why I created the second test, called <code>lkdtm_PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE</code>.
It allocates and frees an object from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then performs
<code>kmem_cache_alloc()+kmem_cache_free()</code> for that cache 400,000 times.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>push_addr</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is reallocated at attempt %lu</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This test effectively pushes the object through the heap quarantine and
reallocates it after it returns back to the allocator freelist:</p>

<p>As you can see, the number of the allocations needed for overwriting
the vulnerable object is almost the same. That would be good for stable
UAF exploitation and should not be allowed.
That's why I developed <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6"><strong>quarantine randomization</strong></a>. This randomization
required very small hackish changes to the heap quarantine mechanism.</p>

<p>The heap quarantine stores objects in batches. On startup, all
quarantine batches are filled by objects. When the quarantine shrinks,
I randomly choose and free half of objects from a randomly chosen batch.
The randomized quarantine then releases the freed object at an unpredictable moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 107884
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 265641
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 100030
   lkdtm: Target object is NOT reallocated in 400000 attempts
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 204731
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 359333
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 289349
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 119893
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 225202
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 87343
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this randomization alone would not stop the attacker:
the quarantine stores the attacker's data (the payload) in the sprayed objects!
This means the reallocated and overwritten vulnerable object contains the payload
until the next reallocation (very bad!).</p>

<p>This makes it important to <strong>erase heap objects before placing them in the heap quarantine</strong>.
Moreover, filling them with zeros gives a chance to detect UAF
accesses to non-zero data for as long as an object stays in the quarantine (nice!).
That functionality already exists in the kernel, it's called <code>init_on_free</code>.
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/5">I integrated it</a> with <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> as well.</p>

<p>During that work I found a bug: in <code>CONFIG_SLAB</code>, <code>init_on_free</code> happens too
late. Heap objects go to the KASAN quarantine while still "dirty." I provided the fix
in a <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/4">separate patch</a>.</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding of the heap quarantine's inner workings, I provided an <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/8">additional
patch</a>, which contains verbose debugging (not for merge).
It's very helpful, see the output example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 123, whole sz 65118872, batch sz 508854
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 494552, REDUCE head batch 0 by 415392, leave 396304
   quarantine: data level in batches:
     0 - 77%
     1 - 108%
     2 - 83%
     3 - 21%
   ...
     125 - 75%
     126 - 12%
     127 - 108%
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 79160, REDUCE head batch 12 by 14160, leave 17608
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 65000, REDUCE head batch 75 by 218328, leave 195232
   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 124, whole sz 64979984, batch sz 508854
   ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The heap quarantine <code>PUT</code> operation you see in this output happens during kernel memory freeing.
The heap quarantine <code>REDUCE</code> operation happens during kernel memory allocation, if the quarantine
size limit is exceeded. The kernel objects released from the heap quarantine return to the allocator
freelist – they are actually freed.
In this output, you can also see that on <code>REDUCE</code>, the quarantine releases some part of
a randomly chosen object batch (see the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6">randomization patch</a> for more details).</p>



<p>I made <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/10/01/7">brief performance tests</a> of the quarantine PoC on real hardware and in virtual machines:</p>
<ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/compilers/1.png" alt="Compilers security report"></p><p>Online compilers are a handy tool to save time and resources for coders, and are freely available for a variety of programming languages. They are useful for learning a new language and developing simple programs, such as the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">“Hello World”</a> exercise. I often use online compilers when I am out, so that I don’t have to worry about locating and downloading all of the resources myself.</p><p>Since these online tools are essentially remote compilers with a web interface, I realized that I might be able to take remote control of the machines through command injection. My research identified a common weakness in many compilers: inadequate sanitization of user-submitted code prior to execution. My analysis revealed that this lack of input filtration enables exploits that an hacker can use to take control of the machine or deliberately cause it to crash.</p><p>A clever attacker can exploit built-in C functions and POSIX libraries to gain control over the computer hosting the online compiler. Commands like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/execl">execl()</a>, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system()</a>, and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getenv">GetEnv()</a> can be used to probe the target machine operating system and run any command on its built-in shell.</p><p>I wanted to write this article to remind how sandboxed environment are important when shipping an application such as this!</p><h2 id="vulnerability-description">Vulnerability description</h2><p>In this section, I will introduce the reader to the vulnerability explaining both theory and practice processes.</p><h3 id="gaining-access">Gaining access</h3><p>In several of the C/C++ compilers that I analyzed, the GetEnv(), system(), functions allow an attacker to study and execute any command on the remote machine. The GetEnv() function allows a hacker to learn information about the machine that is otherwise concealed from the web interface, such as the username and OS version.</p><p>Once this information is revealed, the attacker can begin testing various exploits to achieve privilege escalation and gain access to a root shell. For example, the system() command can be used to execute malicious code and access sensitive data such as logs, website files, etc.</p><p>Since the exploit I discovered involves inserting hostile commands to gain control of an unwitting machine, this attack vector is classified as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection">code injection</a> vulnerability.</p><h3 id="maintaining-control">Maintaining control</h3><p>If hacker tries to run the online compiler every time they want to send a new command, the attack would leave an obvious trace, and the resource use might draw attention to the suspicious activity. These obstacles can be conveniently sidestepped by using the execl() function, which allows the user to specify any arbitrary program to replace the current process. An attacker can gain access to the machine’s built-in shell by invoking the execl() function to replace the current process with <code>/bin/sh</code>, with catastrophic implications.</p><p>Many compilers allow input from the browser, in which case the hacker can craft a program to relay input commands to the shell of the compromised machine. Once the hacker uses <code>execl()</code> to open a shell via browser, they can simply operate the remote machine using <code>system()</code> to inject various instructions. This avoids the need to run the compiler each time the attacker wishes to explore or exploit the compromised machine.</p><h3 id="implications">Implications</h3><p>A hacker that obtains shell access in this way gains access to files and services typically protected from outside users. The attacker now has many options at their disposal for exploiting the machine and/or wreaking havoc; how they proceed will depend on their tools and motives.</p><p>If the attacker wishes to crash the target machine, they can achieve this by (mis)using the fork() function, which creates <a href="https://serhack.me/articles/introduction-to-monerov-and-its-inherent-risks/"><del>a new cryptocurrency</del></a> clone of the current process. A fork() function placed within a while (true) loop will execute indefinitely, repeatedly cloning the process to greedily consumed precious RAM memory. This rapid uncontrolled use of resources will overwhelm the machine, causing a self-DOS (denial of service attack).</p><p>Instead of maliciously crashing a machine, an attacker may wish to monetize their illicit access. This can be accomplished by injecting a cryptocurrency miner, which will generate funds for the attacker at the expense of the victim’s computational resources and electric bill. My analysis showed that this maneuver allows useful exploitation of online compilers that successfully stymied other attacks by sandboxing the environment or adopting more advanced techniques to limit file access.</p><h3 id="theory">Theory</h3><p>This section documents the commands used to gain and maintain access to the online compiler.

Access to protected files and services can be prevented by creating a secure sandbox for the application.

In order to avoid these “mining” attacks, the sandbox should have limited resources and it should be able to reboot itself every 10 minutes.</p><p>To eliminate the underlying weakness, the libraries could be recompiled without the particular exploitable functions. An attacker cannot gain a foothold if the execl() and system() are removed or disabled by recompiling libraries.</p><p>In addition to this, tools such as <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> might be used to create a sandboxed environment. A sandbox is a mechanism to run applications in a limited space. It usually provides a restricted and controlled set of resources to the program that needs to be tested, such as a restricted area of memory or a set of limited system calls; normally, network access, the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices, are disabled or highly restricted.</p><p>At the time of my search, I found at least two compilers with a non-sandboxed environment. I contacted the managers and they resolved in less than a week. For others I verified that they were actually under a sandboxed environment. Injected scripts were immediately identified and the “malicious” user was banned.</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for my articles?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Firestore is Google’s serverless document database offering.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-serverless-mean">What does serverless mean?</h2>

<p>Serverless means that we don’t have to worry about managing the servers on which the database runs. All the management is done automatically by Google. The database will scale up or down depending on the demand.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-document-database">What’s a document database?</h2>

<p>A document database is a non-relational database that stores data in a semi-structured format. A common format used by many document databases is JSON.</p>

<p>In a relational database, we usually create tables with a defined structure (columns and types). In a document database, it’s not necessary to specify the different columns.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>There are two concepts we need to be familiar with to model our Firestore database: <code>documents</code> and <code>collections</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> is similar to a JSON object. Each top level attribute is called a <code>field</code>. A document can’t be bigger than 1MB.</p>

<p>A <code>collection</code> is a group of documents. We can think of it as a table without a schema, just a name.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> can point to a <code>collection</code>, and <code>documents</code> in that <code>collection</code> can point to other <code>collections</code>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-database">Creating a database</h2>

<p>When we talk about creating a database, we are referring to making it possible to create <code>collections</code> and <code>documents</code> in Google Cloud. At the time of this writing, Firestore databases come in 2 flavors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Native mode</code> - Recommended for mobile apps or browsers</li>
  <li><code>Datastore mode</code> - Recommended for back-end servers</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently there is no way to create a database in <code>datastore mode</code> using <code>gcloud</code> cli, so we need to do it from the cloud console. If we want to create a database in native mode we can use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud firestore databases create
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command triggers some initial setup that might take a few minutes.</p>

<p>Once we choose the mode for a Google Cloud project, it can’t be changed. If we want to change it, we would need to create a new project and create another database there.</p>

<h2 id="writing-data">Writing data</h2>

<p>In relational databases we need to define our tables and schemas in advance. That’s not the case on Firebase. Documents are created in collections. If a collection doesn’t exist, it will be created on the fly.</p>

<p>Clients exist for various programming languages. We’re going to use Golang in this article.</p>

<p>Note that <code>GcpCredentialsFile</code> must be a valid service account key with permissions for Firestore (roles/datastore.user), and <code>ProjectId</code> should be the id of the project where the database lives.</p>

<p>We can run our program with:</p>



<p>The <code>Set</code> operation creates a new record or replaces an existing one. The <code>Doc("1")</code> part of the command tells firestore to use <code>1</code> as a document identifier. There can’t be two documents with the same identifier in a collection.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to tell firestore to <code>merge</code> an existing document instead of replacing it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<h2 id="indexes">Indexes</h2>

<p>A very brief note about indexes, because they work differently than in other databases. There are two types of indexes in firestore, <code>single-field indexes</code> and <code>composite indexes</code>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, <code>single-field indexes</code> are indexes made of a single field. Firestore automatically creates <code>single-field indexes</code> for all the fields in a document, so we don’t have to worry about creating these ourselves.</p>

<p>As opposed to <code>single-field indexes</code>, <code>composite indexes</code> are not created automatically. These are indexes formed by more than one field and need to be defined before they can be used.</p>



<p>This article scratched the surface of what can be done with <code>Firestore</code>. There are many things about querying that I didn’t cover, as well as other interesting topics like transactions and arrays. I’m planning on using it in a project, so hopefully I’ll be writing about these topics in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Integrating security as a part of application development is desirable, but it's often forgotten or dismissed in practice. Dependabot is a Github feature that will help you keep all your dependencies invulnerable and up-to-date, and you can enable it in just a few clicks!</p>
</section><article><section><p>I've often been told that integrating security as a role and shared responsibility in application development is important. Yet, in my experience, security is frequently given a low priority by developers. Progress is primarily estimated by looking at an application's new features, and security measures are considered invasive and complicating to our day-to-day-work. Luckily, there are tools that requires little effort to increase our focus on security, such as Github's Dependabot  </p>
<h2>What is Dependabot?</h2>
<p>Simply put, Dependabot is a tool designated to keep dependencies secure and up-to-date. How it works can be summarized in the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dependabot scans your dependency files for outdated or insecure dependencies.</li>
<li>Dependabot creates pull requests for dependencies that need an update.</li>
<li>You review, test and merge Dependabot’s changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following Github's acquisition of Dependabot in May 2019, the feature was added natively to Github. With only a few clicks, Dependabot can easily be enabled from the Github dashboard, and help you keep your application’s dependencies up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Enough background information, let us talk about how to get started. Github's security settings can be configured for an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization">entire organization</a>, applying to all of the organization’s repositories, or it can be configured <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository">per repository</a>. Which is the better option depends on your context. If you are the owner of your organization and it is desirable to enable the security features across all of its repositories, obviously it would be less time consuming to configure this on the organization level, rather than for each repository individually. However, if you are a part of a large organization with lots of teams and projects, enabling Dependabot on the repository level might be the only option.</p>
<p>In this example, we will enable Dependabot on a single repository. In your repository, there should be a button titled “Security”. Note that the security option is only visible to administrators, hence it will not be visible if you don't have the admin role in the repository. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kScW0pN/screenshot-2020-11-21-at-18-06-01-1.png" alt="To enable Dependabot, click on the &quot;Security&quot; button."></p>
<p>In the security overview, there is a row titled “Dependabot alerts”. If not already activated, there should be a button to “Enable Dependabot alerts”. Click it. You should now have three options that you can enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency graph</li>
<li>Dependabot alerts</li>
<li>Dependabot security updates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependency graph</h3>
<p>The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository. Enabling this feature is a prerequisite for the other options, as Dependabot requires access to the dependency graph in order to create alerts and updates.</p>
<h3>Dependabot alerts</h3>
<p>The alerts allows Dependabot to notify you when it finds a weakness. This is probably the key feature that you are here for. When activated, the number of unresolved alerts is highlighted in the "Security" button that we previously clicked. On the security tab, the alerts highlighting currently outdated dependencies are listed. By clicking on an alert, you will find more details on it, such as a description of the vulnerability and in what version of the dependency it was patched.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VMrM5Kh/screenshot-2020-11-16-at-19-59-16.png" alt="Security: Dependabot alerts" title="Unresolved Dependabot alerts are listed in the repository."></p>
<h3>Dependabot security updates</h3>
<p>By enabling the third option, the security updates, whenever a vulnerable dependency is discovered, Dependabot will try to fix it. If it is possible to upgrade the vulnerable dependency without disrupting the dependency graph of the repository, Dependabot will generate a pull request bringing the dependency up-to-date. The pull request is given a compatibility score indicating whether the update could cause breaking changes. The number is based on the percentage of tests in public repositories that passed when performing the same update.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2vr3GBb/dependabot-pull-request.png" alt="Example pull request generated by Dependabot" title="A pull request generated by Dependabot"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in my experience working with Dependabot, more often than not, it is unable to generate pull requests. This is often because the source of the vulnerability is an indirect or transitive dependency. The Dependabot documentation states that <em>“(...) security updates are triggered only for dependencies that are specified in a manifest or lock file. Dependabot is unable to update an indirect or transitive dependency that is not explicitly defined.”.</em> This means that even though Dependabot is able to perform some automatic updates, you should expect to perform most of the updates yourself - for now.</p>
<p>Even though Dependabot is unable to perform automated dependency updates most of the time, I would recommend enabling the feature. Occasionally it <em>will</em> be able to create the pull request for you, and you'll have saved yourself a couple of minutes that you can spend on something else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xXLhGLr/dependabot-pr-error.png" alt="Error message: Dependabot cannot update to the required version" title="More often than not, Dependabot is unable to generate a pull request"></p>
<p>If you already have established an effective process to update your project's dependencies, Dependabot might not be able to help you. Otherwise, you should definitely give it a try. It's free, it takes minimal effort to set up and - no matter how you use it - it's a better option than not monitoring your dependencies in any way.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p>Reggie Fowler, the former NFL minority owner linked to missing Tether and Bitfinex funds, owes his defense team more than $600,000, according to a new<a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/106df130-d8cc-418e-bbc0-8e46715e7b0a.pdf"> court filing</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fowler’s lawyers <a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/12/reginald-fowlers-lawyers-want-to-quit-did-he-neglect-to-pay-them/">want to drop out of the case</a> due to nonpayment, but they need to get permission from the court first.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/24/reggie-fowler-hoodwinks-his-own-defense-team/">Last we left off</a>, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter ordered attorneys at law firm Hogan Lovells—also representing defense lawyer Scott Rosenblum at Rosenblum Schwartz &amp; Fry—to file three versions of a sealed letter dated Nov. 18.</p>



<p>The public version—redacting what should not be revealed to the government or the public—discloses more details on the lawyers’ frustrations with a client who perpetually strings them along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hogan Lovells attorneys James McGovern and Michael Hefter initially asked for a $25,000 retainer in late 2018 when they first met with their client. Fowler only ever paid the retainer, and two years later, he now owes them $600,000.</p>



<p>His defense team believed all the stories he told them that he was swimming in money, so they weren’t too concerned—at first.</p>



<p>“From the very inception of this matter, we have been led to believe that Mr. Fowler is a high net worth individual with substantial assets, which would allow him to pay his legal bills with little hardship,” the lawyers said in their letter to the judge. </p>



<p>Hogan Lovells started working with Fowler on October 18, 2018. They had their first meeting with him on Nov. 8, 2018, around the time Fowler was initially contacted by the FBI. </p>



<p>“When we agreed to represent Mr. Fowler, it was our understanding that he had been targeted by cryptocurrency businessmen seeking to take advantage of Mr. Fowler’s personal balance sheet as a means of transacting cryptocurrency transactions without drawing the attention of bank compliance officers or regulators,” they said. </p>



<p>Fowler was later arrested in Chandler, Arizona, on<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services"> </a>April 30, 2019. (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services">DoJ press release and indictment</a>.)</p>



<p>After his release in May <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/11/reginald-fowler-man-at-center-of-cryptocurrency-scheme-out-on-5-million-bail/">on $5 million bail</a>, Fowler hired Scott Rosenblum to join the defense team. Rosenblum asked for a $275,000 retainer and an additional $85,000 per week retainer, if the case went to trial.&nbsp;Rosenblum received a partial retainer of $100,000, which Hogan Lovells notes that Fowler paid “while he had several unpaid, overdue invoices for legal services issued by Hogan Lovells.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Fowler paid another lawyer (unnamed) in Portugal in full for her services. He also paid international law firm Reed Smith LLP for&nbsp;services rendered in 2018.</p>



<p>“The fact that other attorneys had received payments from Mr. Fowler for their services led us reasonably to believe that Mr. Fowler’s representations to us that he would pay our bills was truthful,” the lawyers said.</p>



<p>In the second half of 2019, the lawyers were diligent about contacting Fowler for money. Each time they reached out, he told them payment was imminent and that “transactions or business deals that would fund the payment of our fees were in process”—but he never paid him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, following a plea bargain that went awry and a superseding indictment, the defense team realized the case would likely go to trial, requiring a substantial amount of work, and still no check from their client. </p>



<p>Fowler has ample funds, they said, including “$10 million in real estate that is unencumbered and could have been liquidated or monetized at any point during the past two years.” His refusal to pay, the lawyers added, has “led to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”</p>



<p>The government has till Dec. 8 to respond and replies are due Dec. 11.</p>

You will probably disagree with at least some of it, and that is completely fine. The important part is the thought process – don’t just read through it and agree or disagree, think about <em>what</em> you agree or disagree with and <em>why</em>. Becoming aware of these things is valuable: once you become aware of why you dislike something, you can start doing something about it.</p>
</section><article><section><p>Over the years, I have noticed there is a small set of features I value more than others in programming languages. These features allow me to express myself in a concise and clear manner, makes my code more readable, and minimizes the amounts of errors I make. They are not "magical" in any way. Far from it. Rather, they are more.. fundamental aspects of the progamming language itself. Let’s dive in!</p>
<h2>Expressive type system</h2>
<p>Types help me reason. Explicitly typed code communicates intent better, and is easier to navigate without losing context completely. Type systems comes in a variety of flavors, ranging from the most simple ones to more advanced systems with gradual typing, dependent types, type classes, and so on. Although I personally prefer more advanced ones, I believe this is more of a subjective topic. And of less importance, really. The main benefit of type systems exists in even the simplest ones: increased safety and readability. Remember: the compiler is your friend – the more it can verify, the better!</p>
<h2>Type inference</h2>
<p>I was a bit unsure if this point had its place in this blog post. On one hand, I feel its more of a convenience feature than strictly neccessary. On the other, an overly chatty and boilerplaty type system can cause more harm than good –&nbsp;if your business logic drowns in types, it’s too far in the wrong direction. Java, around the 1.5 era, is an example of this. In addition, type inference itself is a a double-egded sword. If the compiler inferes a different type than what you would have thought, it can be quite hard to spot where the actual error is. This is the reason some languages and communities define best practices around type inference, like being explicit in function signatures. Anyway. When I find that perfect spot between explicit types and inferred types, it just makes me really happy.</p>
<h2>Algebraic data types</h2>
<p>I remember the first time I enountered sum types. My first response was «but.. Isn’t this just some kind of enums?». I can kind of see why I thought that, but I feel this is a limiting way of approaching them. Where enums helps me limit valid values, algebraic data types is so much more. It enables me to model my domain and state in a precise and correct manner, and makes illegal states «impossible». This didn’t really become clear to me until I went back to Java. I find modelling without them cumbersome and hard, and sometimes even end up in situations where I can’t avoid impossible states. Few things are more confusing than finding the comment «this can’t happen» in a branch of someones code.</p>
<h2>First class functions</h2>
<p>I don’t even understand why this is subject to discussion anymore, but functions should be treated just like any other value <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> in a programming language. Returning functions and accepting functions as parameters is a fundamental feature to create abstractions and solve problems with composition. This just isn’t up for debate – I would take first class functions over any other feature any day of the week!</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> – I use the term "value" loosely here. I don’t mean to debate value types, reference types, and pass by value or reference. Those are implementation details. The point is to see what advantages you get when a language treats simple values and functions the same. </p>
<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Functional programming taught me to value these features. Sure, you will find imperative languages with these features as well, but they never feel like a core feature of the language. Even Java comes with some sort of primitive type inference these days, but it mostly feels tacked onto the language.</p>
<p>With some notable exceptions (looking at you, LISP), these are core features in all functional programming languages I use. They make my day better, so I would think hard before adopting a language without them these days.</p>
<p>Which feature do you miss or disagree with the most?</p></section></article></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<p>
As an archaeologist, Florian Huber is in the truest sense of the word with all waters. He searched for ancient Mayan antiquities in the flooded caves of the Yucatán, and dived to the bottom of fjords and deep alpine lakes. Again and again, however, the Kiel underwater researcher was drawn to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, where he tracked down wrecks or examined flora and fauna together with biologists.
</p>
<p>
It was here, of all places, that the well-traveled researcher made his most exciting discovery. Huber was actually working with two colleagues in the Geltinger Bucht, not far from Flensburg, in the service of environmental protection. The divers looked for ghost nets, abandoned fishing nets that become deadly traps for marine animals at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
From on board the “Mola Mola”, a nearly eight-meter-long motor catamaran, the researchers systematically scanned the sea floor with sonar. If the system detects a disused network or another object on the ground, the tracking device receives conspicuous sound pulses. The divers then slip into their suits, strap on their compressed air cylinders and drop backwards from the ship’s railing into the cold water to check.

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been spending an unreasonable amount of time trying to understanding performance jitters in a C++ application I’m working on. I have been measuring the time taken to execute a physics update as part of a graphics loop, something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Need to analyze performance of this function:
</span><span></span>    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m interested in optimizing the physics step, so I instrument it using <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono"><code>std::chrono</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>chrono</span><span>;</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>
    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>
    <span>duration</span><span>&lt;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>elapsed</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>;</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>physics_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>elapsed</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s what time taken looks like:</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://karthikkaranth.me/img/blog/performance-benchmarking-beware-frequency-scaling/time_jitter.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>That’s a terrifying amount of jitter! Many dead ends and experiments later, I noticed that the performance stabilized when I started <em>drawing more things</em> to understand the problem. Turns out, the jitters were a result of <em>not doing enough work</em> in the draw call!</p>

<p>Operating systems typically employ some form of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling">CPU frequency scaling</a> to save power when the system isn’t doing much work. The default governor on my system would keep the CPU at a low-power low-frequency mode, and dynamically increase it when the system load increases.</p>

<p>My application ran at 60FPS(about 16.67ms per frame). Since the update took much less than that overall, the process would sleep till the next frame. The default CPU governor <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors">powersave</a> would keep the CPU at a lower frequency because it sees the process mostly sleeping! During the update function however, the frequency would be scaled. This caused massive fluctuations in the recorded benchmarks!</p>

<p>Also, I should note that this was a symptom of improper benchmarking: I knew that the performance was stable if I simply ran the physics updates and didn’t draw anything. :( This entire ordeal was an attempt to understand why drawing would cause such massive differences in performance!</p>

<p>To verify this, I <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/855744">switched the governor</a> to performance:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span>F</span></span>irst broadcast in November 1995, <em>This American Life</em> is the most influential precursor to narrative podcasting as it exists today. Over the last 25 years, the show founded and led by Ira Glass has built a vast network of producers and writers who have set standards across all genres of audio production. Two of the biggest names in the podcasting boom — <em>Serial</em>’s Sarah Koenig and Gimlet Media’s Alex Blumberg — were deeply involved with the show’s golden age. Many other producers from that period: Starlee Kine, Brian Reed, Hillary Frank, Scott Carrier, Jonathan Goldstein, and former intern PJ Vogt, to name just a few, have gone on to create acclaimed podcasts of their own.</p><p>What makes a good <em>This American Life</em> story? The show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/submissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submissions page</a> narrows it down to two principles: “There are characters in some situation, and a conflict,” and “[the] stories raise some bigger question or issue, some universal thing to think about.” But I would argue that the key ingredient is the contributor. The variety of styles on display in <em>This American Life </em>has separated the program from a traditional newsmagazine, whether that be <em>60 Minutes</em> or one found in print. And so, to make a list of the best episodes of <em>This American Life,</em> is to spotlight the work of the many staff and producers who make the show.</p><p>Surveying the following list, two things become apparent. First, episodes 300 to 400 (released from roughly 2006 to 2010) indeed constituted a kind of “golden age” for the show. During this period, production of <em>This American Life</em> moved from Chicago to New York (on account of the show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/node/43664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief experimentation with television</a>), and the program became a force beyond itself. While much of the show’s first 10 years turned around the show’s home base of Chicago, once in New York, the show went global. It might be that no one takes you seriously until you’ve been at work for a decade, or it might just be that this was the moment Gen X became a silent majority of the culture industry. There was a political dimension to this: as the Bush administration tripped over itself in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the follies of the Iraq and Afghan Wars became ever more apparent, <em>This American Life</em> was perfectly positioned to reach into the heart of these major stories and record the shifting ground under life in these United States.</p><p>The second fact is that we like long episodes. During that same five-year period, <em>This American Life</em> began to earn its reputation for blockbuster, hour-long narratives that would carry it into the 2010s. Some of these episodes — “The Giant Pool of Money,” “#1 Party School” among them — are so legendary that one can now forget that the show’s bread and butter has always been its act-based structure. The power of this method, one which many podcasts, due to their niche focuses, can never quite live up to, is to find disperse stories on a theme and situate them together in a way that makes them resonate in new ways.</p><p>This resonance gives these stories, some of them goofy, nerdy, or downright silly, the power to reshape one’s feelings. While on the surface <em>This American Life</em> can fall prey to the kind of neoliberal ephemera people lambast public radio for, underneath there is a radical current that infuses many of the episodes that we’ve chosen here. The program can be a one-hour chapter of <em>The People’s History</em> delivered to radio each week. It puts the faults and frailties of the U.S. on naked display, stripped of the power, prestige, and distance that older and more traditional mediators dress them in. It is for this reason, and the ones listed below, that we find <em>This American Life</em> to be one of the greatest American journalism projects. <em>– Brendan Mattox</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/15/dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15: Dawn</a></strong></p><p>An early highlight of <em>This American Life</em> is “Dawn,” the episode first to give the entire hour over to a single contributor. Master storyteller and magazine journalist Jack Hitt’s work holds a strong influence over the first decade of the program. “Dawn” follows Hitt as he interviews old friends and family in Charlotte about a mysterious neighbor. Fans of the podcast <em>S-Town</em> will find much to love here, as the Faulkneresque story of the end of The Old South yields to a story about sexuality, gender, and the way that media inserts itself into the stories of our lives.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/61/fiasco-1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">61: Fiasco!</a></strong></p><p>One of <em>This American Life</em>’s most rerun episodes, “Fiasco!” is a collection of masterful debacles. Everything goes wrong, at least once in a while. When it does, you can only hope someone is there to record the wreckage. A community theater’s attempt to dazzle in their production of <em>Peter Pan </em>shatters the fourth wall and a rookie cop succumbs to a devious foe (a squirrel). Each of the episode’s four acts investigates a doomed, hilarious series of errors.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/80/running-after-antelope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80: Running After Antelope</a></strong></p><p>The legend about TAL contributor Scott Carrier (later explored in Carrier’s own podcast <em><a href="https://homebrave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home of the Brave</a></em>) is that he started making radio by hitchhiking, cross-country, from his home in Utah to the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Arriving on a Saturday, he asked the first <em>Weekend Edition</em> producer who would listen to teach him how to make radio. Carrier is fiercely partisan, an outsider in every possible sense, and keenly unafraid to burn bridges. He writes like Hemingway, with brief language, quick movement, and constant grappling with the more toxic angles of masculinity. He can sound, at times, both dangerous and uniquely tuned to an unknown rhythm. All of these traits are on display in “Running After Antelope,” a 40-minute narrative of a decade-long attempt to chase down an antelope on foot, and how his desire to be “primitive” conflicted with the inexorable movement of time. Carrier would later get a full episode of <em>This American Life</em> dedicated to his work (<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/181/the-friendly-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">181: The Friendly Man</a>).</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/109/notes-on-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">109: Notes on Camp</a></strong></p><p>This episode is yet another example of <em>This American Life</em>’s ability to turn a mundane topic — in this case, stories from summer camp — into a meaningful exploration of our values. The camp stories are funny and awkward, as we all were during our early adolescent summers. The scary stories, first kisses, and halting efforts at adulthood that appear throughout the episode answer at least some of the questions they pose about community and the importance of being together.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/172/24-hours-at-the-golden-apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">172: 24 Hours at the Golden Apple</a></strong></p><p>One of the hallmarks of <em>This American Life</em> is its commitment to telling stories of everyday life, eschewing the need for every episode to be relevant to the news. “24 Hours at the Golden Apple,” an episode with a rather literal title, shows this approach can be revelatory. In this episode, Glass and a few other producers spend the day at a local Chicago diner, from early morning until late into the night. We meet a regular who plays harmonica as the sun rises, a waitress who’s been working the night shift for the past 26 years, a pair of teen girls trying to corral friends to come join them at the diner, and many, many others.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/199/house-on-loon-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">199: House on Loon Lake</a></strong></p><p>In this engrossing episode, producer Adam Beckman tells the story of how, when he was eleven years old, he and two friends came across an abandoned house in the small town of Freedom, New Hampshire. The three boys dare each other to venture inside, and what they find — a crumbling newspaper, decaying clothes, old letters, and much more — hints that the home had been untouched for decades. From there, “a sort of real-life Hardy Boys mystery” commences, as Beckman and his friends work to uncover who lived in the house and the circumstances under which they had to leave.</p><p><strong><em>Want to receive our latest podcast reviews and episode recommendations via email? <a href="https://podcastreview.org/newsletter">Sign up here</a> for our weekly newsletter.</em></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/205/plan-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">205: Plan B</a></strong></p><p>“Plan B”&nbsp;features stories from two of <em>This American Life</em>’s former contributors, John Hodgman and Jonathan Goldstein. In one sense, John Hodgman’s story, It’s Another Tequila Sunrise, is about Cuervo Man, Jose Cuervo’s Princeton-educated brand ambassador who seemingly exists to balance tequila shots on his head and be the life of the party. In another, it’s about fear and acceptance of who we are. Jonathan Goldstein faces similar considerations as he deals with his unexpected success as a telemarketer. Both segments wrap the discomfort of self-examination in the humor of Hodgman and Goldstein’s small absurdities.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">220: Testosterone</a></strong></p><p>The episode in which every <em>This American Life</em> crew member decides to measure their testosterone levels competition-style begins with Alex Blumberg’s quest to find out how much the hormone has shaped his life. Two excellent, extended interviews give this 2002 show its verve: one with a journalist whose body briefly stopped producing testosterone, one with a transgender man who noticed a series of astounding changes to his own thought patterns when he began testosterone injections. The episode doesn’t seek to prove anything, but hearing these two men, plus every TAL producer, try to understand how hormones inform their character is funny and fascinating.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/241/20-acts-in-60-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">241: 20 Acts in 60 Minutes</a></strong></p><p>The entire cast of characters briefly guest star in the 2003 episode that abandoned the regular act-based structure for 20 mini-stories. Jonathan Goldstein tells a long joke. David Rakoff reveals his bad instincts. Starlee Kine finds the perfect punch line about low-level celebrity. David Sedaris finds out he’s been duped for years. Ira Glass discovers the mystery of Vienna Beef. The ultimate highlights of the experiment, Acts 6 and 20, tell two stories from separate juvenile detention centers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/266/im-from-the-private-sector-and-im-here-to-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">266: I’m from the Private Sector and I’m Here to Help</a></strong></p><p>If one wants to pinpoint the shift of <em>This American Life</em> towards its current reputation for intensely original reporting, a strong contender is this 2004 report on the employees of Custer Battles, one of the many private security contractors to flood Iraq in the wake of the United States contentious (and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3661134.stm">illegal</a>) invasion in 2003.

              <h2>Youâ€™ve launched your new productâ€¦ Now what? Time to Get Selling! Hereâ€™s how...</h2>

<p>While the transition from initial product development to sales sounds easy enough, the shift is actually one of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs and startups. After months of long, hard work developing your product, the actual launch feels like the finish line. In fact, the race has just begun. You finally have something to offer, so now itâ€™s time to get selling. Make it rain.</p>

<p>But, you have no idea how to make a light drizzle, let alone a rainstorm. You need to find people who want your product and are willing to pay for it. Beyond friends and family, how do you find people interested in what you offer? You need leads and there are tools that can help you find them.</p>

<p>Lead generation <em>(or lead gen, as many entrepreneurs call it)</em> is the process of locating prospects that might be interested in your product so that you can reach out, introduce your product and start to get people interested. It helps you to start selling, which you need to create revenues, keep the lights on, and, ultimately, grow.</p>

<p>Of course, lead-gen is the start of the selling process. The sales cycle can be quite involved, including lead nurturing and conversion, but letâ€™s focus on lead-gen for now.</p>

<h2>How Do You Generate Leads?</h2>

<p>It all starts with understanding your target customer. Who actually needs the product you offer? Who is experiencing the problem your product solves? Is this a solution for large corporations, medium-sized companies, or small, emerging businesses? Or perhaps it appeals to individuals, to families, to retired homeowners or bicycle commuters or Parkour-practicing pet owners. To be successful, start with one target. You can expand with other campaigns to broaden your revenue streams down the road, but for now, focus on one.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s the decision-maker for this solution within the organization. If you are offering accounting software, for example, you might want to target the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the financial team. For office cleaning products, youâ€™d want to reach office managers, and if itâ€™s an employee training program, youâ€™d target the HR team.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the sales team would seek out lists from organizations that reach the target audience -- often magazines or trade organizations. A list of CFO Magazine readers, for example, was the best way to reach leads who worked in finance. The rise of social media has changed this, providing new ways to interact with a target audience. Today, businesses need a better way to sell than simply making cold calls downs on a static list. You need dynamic solutions that find qualified leads and provide information that helps you sell better.</p>

<p>Fortunately, lead-gen has become automated and highly targeted. Drawing on lists, but also social information and data, lead-gen can provide a more detailed context to help you sell. Beyond finding CFOs who might want your product, look for a solution that helps you understand the preferences of each lead. What are the CFOâ€™s preferred social media channels? Is she active on LinkedIn? How long has she been the CFO? Does she belong to a professional organization? Is she quoted in business news articles?</p>

<p>To take advantage of these new techniques, look for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions that can generate leads, provide rich information on each customer, and help you manage the experience throughout the entire customer lifecycle. While some stand-alone lead-gen applications can help, the integrated CRM approach will help you not only generate leads but convert them to loyal customers that can fuel your growth for years to come.</p>

<p>There are mM=any CRM solutions to choose from. The market leaders are effective for large, enterprise customers but are costly and can be overkill for small, emerging businesses. Seek out a CRM solution designed for start-ups and high-growth companies. You want a solution that will generate leads, help you start selling, and successfully move from pure product development to sales that will allow your company to survive and thrive â€” without the high cost or high-pressure upsell from the CRM provider.</p>

<p>Tapdesk is a CRM platform designed for companies as small as one solopreneur and is extremely effective for businesses with up to 250 users. Itâ€™s a solution designed to help startups get started, generate revenue, and begin to grow. It was built to make lead gen easy and straightforward, to help your company get selling.</p>

We are quickly embracing digital alternatives because they are more efficient and easy to use.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Holiday greetings are being written on WhatsApp or email because itâ€™s fast, grocery lists are written in a to-do app because itâ€™s convenient, and documents are being written in the cloud because itâ€™s collaborative. But the convenience has a downside.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>People are gradually forgetting how to write.</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>Especially those whose languages depend on strokes and symbols like Chinese and Japanese. A </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxHskrqMqII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by a popular YouTube channel, Asian Boss has showed that all of their Chinese interviewees have â€” to a certain extent â€” forgotten how to write certain words. A similar </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJNxPRBvRQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by That Japanese Man Yuta on YouTube reported the same outcome with native Japanese people. The main reason? Keyboards.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span><span>But is this a bad thing? Yes and no.</span></span></strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>Yes, because writing will be a lost art but most importantly, there are evidences that suggest writing have certain cognitive benefits.</span></span></p><p><span><span>However, as a language-learner, this speeds up the process of learning. Rather than learning how to write complex characters, learners will only need to learn how to recognize them. Vocabulary flashcards and reading exercises are sufficient and more practical to learn characters.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Since the world is becoming less reliant on pen and paper, there is no need for casual â€” or even serious â€” language learners to learn how to write. Take the Japanese language proficiency exams for instance. There is no written exam at all, from beginner to advanced tests. All you need to know is how to read and comprehend conversations.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I personally havenâ€™t used a pen for serious writing in years. I am also learning various languages, like Mandarin and Arabic, by reading and typing instead of writing. Am I declining cognitively? I donâ€™t think so. I exercise every day, eat moderately, and read abundantly. Surely, thatâ€™s enough.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How do you feel about this?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we are going to get AirDrop running on a Raspberry Pi 3 (not B+, unfortunately) running Rasbian Stretch.
While AirDrop itself implements a HTTP-based protocol (see <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OpenDrop</a>), it uses a dedicated Wi-Fi based link layer called Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL). In order to use AirDrop, we’ll enable AWDL capabilities on the Raspberry Pi using <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OWL</a>, our open AWDL implementation. OWL is implemented as user space program and requires a Wi-Fi card with working monitor mode and frame injection.</p>

<h2 id="enable-monitor-mode-with-frame-injection">Enable monitor mode with frame injection</h2>

<p>Since the BCM43430A1 Wi-Fi chip in the RPi3 does not support monitor mode out-of-the-box, we’ll use <a href="https://nexmon.org/">Nexmon</a> to patch the firmware.
The following steps are adapted from the project’s <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<p>First, we need to install some dependencies.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> apt upgrade
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>raspberrypi-kernel-headers git <span>\</span>
                 libgmp3-dev gawk qpdf bison flex make
<span>sudo </span>apt remove wpasupplicant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we prepare Nexmon…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon.git
<span>cd </span>nexmon
<span>touch </span>DISABLE_STATISTICS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and compile required libraries and tools.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>su
<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>!</span> <span>-f</span> /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd </span>buildtools/isl-0.10/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./configure <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>ln</span> <span>-s</span> /usr/local/lib/libisl.so <span>\</span>
         /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd</span> ../../ <span>;</span> <span>fi
</span><span>source </span>setup_env.sh
make
<span>cd </span>utilities/nexutil/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> ../../
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are now ready to build and install the monitor mode firmware patch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cd </span>patches/bcm43430a1/7_45_41_46/nexmon/
make
make backup-firmware
make install-firmware
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the above step is only necessary for Wi-Fi chips/drivers where monitor mode and frame injection support is missing. Other chips using the ath9k driver such as the Atheros AR9280 work out-of-the-box. Since Nexmon does not offer frame injection for the BCM43455C0 chip yet, you currently cannot use OWL on a 3B+ model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="install-owl">Install OWL</h2>

<p>Next, we are installing <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl">OWL</a>, our AWDL implementation. First, we need some libraries (libpcap, libev, and libnl).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>libpcap-dev libev-dev libnl-3-dev <span>\</span>
                 libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, it should be as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl.git
<span>cd </span>owl
git submodule update <span>--init</span>
<span>mkdir </span>build
<span>cd </span>build
cmake ..
make
<span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-opendrop">Install OpenDrop</h2>

<p>In the last step, we’ll install our AirDrop-compatible <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop">OpenDrop</a> client and server.
Again, we need some dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>python3 python3-pip libjpeg-dev libopenjp2-7-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we can clone and install the software.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop.git
<span>sudo </span>pip3 <span>install</span> ./opendrop
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
		<img title="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" alt="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" src="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
	</a></p><p>Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop</p>
</div>

<h2 id="receive-files-via-airdrop">Receive files via AirDrop</h2>

<p>Now that all tools are installed, we can start a test run and use the Raspberry Pi to receive files via AirDrop.</p>

<p>Since we use Nexmon to enable monitor mode, we need to manually enable monitor mode and set the correct Wi-Fi channel (the RPi3 only supports the 2.4 GHz band, so we’ll use channel 6).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>iw phy <span>`</span>iw dev wlan0 info | gawk <span>'/wiphy/ {printf "phy" $2}'</span><span>`</span> interface add mon0 <span>type </span>monitor
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig mon0 up
<span>sudo </span>nexutil <span>-k6</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we start <code>owl</code> to enable frame reception via AWDL (option <code>-N</code> tells <code>owl</code> that the interface is already in monitor mode, you can add <code>-v</code> to increase the logging output).</p>



<p>In a second shell, we can start the <code>opendrop</code> receiver.</p>



<p>Now, when opening the sharing pane on an iOS device, a new receiver appears after a short delay and we can send files!</p>

But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.

              <p>This is my own journey on getting a CS degree and why I think you should or shouldn't major in Computer Science.</p><p>If you google right now, what are the best majors to study in college, it's a guarantee that Computer Science (CS) will be on almost every list. There are so many statistics about how much <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/06/12/computer-science-graduates-earnings/">CS graduates make</a>. At some big companies the likes of FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), fresh CS graduates can easily command six figures salaries, including benefits and cool perks. The total compensation in these companies is hardly less than six figures ($100,000)!</p><p>Computer Science is considered one of the top majors as far as ROI (Return on Investment) is concerned. Just year one out of school and into the workforce a CS grad will be making higher compared to grads from other majors. Even when someone isn't lucky enough to land one of the positions in big tech companies (FAANG), still they can easily make 55k fresh from school. <em>It should also be noted that the writer of this article is based in the US, so the figures here might not be so representative of other regions in the world.</em></p><p>So looking at the job prospects and earning potential, you can see why there is such a flux of students wanting to do CS in college.</p><p>And here is the question, should you major in Computer Science? </p><p>This post is about my journey on deciding to major in CS and why I would advise someone to major or not to major in CS. </p><p>...</p><p>December 2014, I got the news that I will be going to a small college in the Midwest of the United States for my college education. I was 23 by the time and at that point in my life, I had made some big life mistakes already (like quitting high school to become a professional athlete). As you might have guessed that didn't end well. 2 years and a half taught me a lot about life, dreams, aspirations. and most importantly it taught me about family...that will be a blog post for some other time. But there I was reading the email that in about 8 months I would be in school again for my bachelor's. Before quitting high school, I used to say to myself... "if I go to college I would study Psychology and Philosophy"...because the two fields really dug my intellectual curiosity. But when people asked me what would I do with Psychology or Philosophy...I didn't know what to tell them...I only knew I wanted to learn more about the two fields. I wasn't interested in a professional career in any of the two fields...just wanted to study them. Did that ever happen to you?</p><p>So I didn't want to make the same mistakes I did during high school years...I intentionally made a choice of choosing a major field of study that will be lucrative and pretty much guarantee me success. There I was googling the best majors to study in college.</p><p>Here is a short snippet of that research:</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png" alt="Majors That Pay You Back" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Majors That Pay You Back</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png" alt="Major vs Salary Potential" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Major vs Salary Potential</figcaption></figure><p>Armored with that research plus a lot of other information I got from friends who were already studying CS and those who graduated with good jobs, I narrowed to Computer Science.</p><p>...</p><p>Fall 2015, my first year in college:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2015 (Left) &amp; Spring 2016(Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>Sophomore year, Fall 2016</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2016 (Left) &amp; Spring 2017 (Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>By the end of Spring semester 2017, I had completed<strong> 22 credits of the 46 credits</strong> required by the CS program at my school.</p><p>In the fall of 2017, I didn't return back to campus...I had an opportunity to study abroad in London where for the whole semester I didn't take any Computer Science class.

But for easy of following through I just listed in the order of the first time I took them. In addition, I took one elective from another school which was <strong>CS 428</strong> <strong>Network Programming, </strong>and also I took <strong>EN 300C,</strong> an <strong>Advanced Writing</strong> class from another department in my school which substituted for my <strong>Technical Writing</strong> class in my CS major. And one more <strong>Math class</strong> was required to satisfy the requirements for the CS major.</p><p>So in a nutshell, that was my major. 4.5 or 5 years later, <strong>46 CS credits</strong> bagged and I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science.</p><p>The reason I listed all those classes above is to give you kinda a full picture of what a CS degree is about. When you just hear the words 'Computer Science', you might not really know what it's about...So the subjects above will at least shade some light. However, if you really wanna dive deep, I would suggest not just to look at the subjects offered in the program BUT make sure you read the syllabus too if you're able to get one. Syllabi will list topic by topic and week by week of exactly what the specific CS subjects will cover, there will be no surprises!</p><p>...</p><p>Now comes the meat of my blog post...Should you major in Computer Science?</p><p>Taking the money component out - we already know that a CS major can result in higher earning potential overall. What other reasons are there for you to major in see? Are you even interested in the field itself?</p><p>Most people when they hear about the Tech fields or Silicon Valley or working at Google or Microsoft, they mostly think about Computers and they might think about Computer Science as a way to get there, though they might not really know much about the Computer Science field itself.</p><p>I don't blame them, I was in the same situation...Initially I thought Computer Science will be learning about how to create these beautiful websites that I see on the Internet. Or maybe by studying Computer Science I will be able to make the next Facebook, Instagram and so forth. That was what initially clouded my mind.</p><p>Some of you might be surprised to know that a career in tech especially the one involving Computer Science or Programming for that matter...might not necessarily constitute you making products from scratch. There will be a lot of trying to understand, fix and maintain past code base. It might not be as alluring as some of the TV shows might make you believe. The technologies you work with might not be the ones of your interest. For example, I have never liked C# as a programming language or .NET frameworks as a web dev platform but there I was at my first job...using Windows, Visual Studio and .NET framework. You can imagine how excited I was.</p><p>...</p><p>As someone who has traveled this journey though not for so long, I can't emphasize enough on the importance of knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into. After all, college is a big investment both in terms of money and time, so pick both your majors and career carefully. One way of getting a good feel for what you're getting yourself into, either it's Computer Science or any other field is to make sure you get some internships while in college. Get an internship in something you're either majoring in or considering a career in. That will give you real-world experience of what your profession will look like once you graduate. It will give you time to think about the work culture, the work hours, the pressure, the work itself, etc. ...I had a friend in college who after doing an internship for about 4 months or so...he found out a career in Computer Science or programming wasn't for him. And he went ahead and changed his major from Computer Science to Economics, on the way he secured a minor in Computer Science.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png" alt="Do you like your job?" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Do you like your job?</figcaption></figure><p>One of the things that will make you like your job is by first enjoying studying the field that you're in. Do you enjoy the field you're majoring in?</p><p>Look at the classes I listed above, do they interest you in any way? If they do then congrats! A CS program might be a good fit. But don't just end there like I said in the beginning...I would like you to go and check the syllabus for all those classes and see what you will study week in and week out. </p><p>Let me tell you something... as someone who was more interested in web development...I didn't enjoy most if not all of my CS classes. Had I used that time to learn more about web design and development...learning specific languages used for the job I would have benefited more and enjoyed my time in college. Here web development technologies like JavaScript, PHP and their frameworks together with WordPress, SASS, the JAM stack, etc.</p><p>So what am I trying to say here..? If the reason you decided to get into a CS program is because you love to design and develop websites...then you might be in the wrong place...a CS class in Computational modeling will be pretty much a bore to you. You would appreciate that time instead if you were learning first hand the tools and languages you will be working with in the real world.</p><p>Walk this process backward...ask yourself...who do you want to become...a web developer? a software engineer? a UI/UX engineer? a database administrator..? a network engineer? Then once you know whom you want to become...look for resources that will allow you to do that...these might involve a major in college, maybe a minor, books, online courses, tools used in the industry, etc.</p><p> If you pick a major, don't be blinded by a bracket name like a 'Computer Science'. Understand exactly what that entails...go and look at the syllabus of each course you will take in that major. Don't just assume a CS major will grant you those mobile or web development skills etc. The job market can be very specific...They might look for a Java developer, a PHP developer, a Python developer, an iOS developer etc. While knowledge of one language might help you easily pick up another one...it's a good thing if you can focus on what you're interested in early on. </p><p>...Being a mobile developer is different from being a web …</p></div></div>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<p>‘<a href="https://perl.org/">Perl</a> is dead’, is a meme that’s just plain wrong. <a href="https://www.perl.org/about.html">Perl isn’t dead</a>. It’s just dead to some programmers. Complicated regexes? Sigils? There’s more than one way to do it (<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#TMTOWTDI">TMTOWTDI</a>)? Sometimes when programmers encounter Perl in the wild they react with fear. “WTF!?”, they cry! But fear needn’t be a Perl killer. If you take the time to see past Perl’s imperfections and <a href="https://www.perl.org/learn.html">walk the learning curve</a>, there are rich rewards: Perl is an imperfect but pragmatic and expressive language that for 30+ years has helped programmers get the job done.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> <a href="https://design.raku.org/">designed</a> <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>, with the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/mu/blob/master/AUTHORS">help of the Perl community,</a> he fixed most of Perl’s imperfections and doubled down on Perl’s DNA. Perl values pragmatism, expressivity, and whipupitude and Raku does too! Why stop at sigils ($@%) when you can have twice the fun with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Twigils">twigils</a> ($!, %!, @! etc)?</p>



<p>For some programmers, however, the mere sight of a twigil can induce fear. Like Perl, Raku’s expressive power is a double-edged sword – potentially stopping other programmers in their tracks. A Raku programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#DWIM">DWIM</a>” (do what I mean) can be another programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#WAT">WAT</a>!?”</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/nige123/2b7b384dfe2c6e732ecb1c62b3ce6c52#fear-free-code-that-flows"></a></h2>



<h2>Fear-free code that <em>flows</em></h2>



<p>We write programs for two audiences: humans and the computer. It’s the humans that should come first. If I can’t understand my own code in a week’s time, what hope do my colleagues have? Fortunately we can help ourselves, and each other, to have a smooth ride up the Raku learning curve.</p>

<p>Learning Raku is never boring but when did you last encounter a bump while learning Raku? That’s a chance for you to help yourself and others. You could leave an empathic comment in your code, contribute some documentation, write a blog post, give a talk, ask and answer a question on StackOverflow etc.</p>



<p>The joy of programming is <em><a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/perl-6-christmas-have-an-appropriate-amount-of-fun/">finding flow</a> </em>for ourselves and each other while getting things done. No Raku-riffing-rockstars required.</p>

<h2>Surfing the learning curve</h2>



<p>Maybe you haven’t started learning Raku yet? Now is the perfect time to add Raku to your toolbox. Here are some of the learning resources I’ve found useful and I hope you do too.</p>



<p>Firstly, there is the pithy and concise <a href="https://raku.guide/">introduction to Raku</a> that includes instructions on how to install Raku. The Raku interpreter itself is very helpful. If your Raku program contains errors <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/19/fixing-flow/">Raku often suggests ways to fix them</a>.</p>



<p>For programmers coming from other language(s), <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Raku">RosettaCode</a> showcases coding solutions in different languages side-by-side. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the expressive power of Raku’s operators. Raku’s expressivity typically results in <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Last_Friday_of_each_month#Raku">less lines of code</a> (LLOC).</p>



<p>An idea for your first Raku program is to translate a progam you know well from a different language. Here are some helpful guides for translating from other languages to Raku: <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell">Perl</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/py-nutshell">Python</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/rb-nutshell">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/haskell-to-p6">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/js-nutshell">Javascript</a>.</p>



<p>There’s a growing list of books on Raku and a <a href="https://perl6book.com/">flowchart for choosing one</a>. Here’s a selection:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learningraku.com/">Learning Raku</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484261088">Raku Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484262573">Raku Recipes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484232279">Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars</a></li></ul>



<p>Searching for Raku-related problems will often point to the official documentation at <a href="https://docs.raku.org/">docs.raku.org</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/raku">Raku answers on StackOverflow</a>.</p>



<p>When you want to learn more about a specific sub-topic or dive into the deeper design philosophy of Raku check out <a href="https://www.jnthn.net/slides.html">Jonathan Worthington’s clear presentations and explanations</a>.</p>



<p>Finally if you’re stuck on something, or just want to share in the –<a href="https://www.raku.org/fun/">Ofun</a> of learning Raku the <a href="https://www.raku.org/community/irc">#raku IRC channel on freenode</a> is friendly and welcoming.</p>



<p>Both Perl and Raku are useful tools in any programmer’s toolbox: no fear needed, just remember to help the code <em>flow</em>!</p>



<p>Long live Perl and Raku.</p>



<p>Happy Christmas!</p>

<p>Labels: Syntax</p>

<h3 id="indentation-defined-program-structure">Indentation-defined program structure</h3>

<p>I’ve planned for a long while to make Tuplex program structure indentation-defined like in e.g. Python.
Dispensing with curly braces and semicolons makes the code easier on the eye, and easier to type.
However this required a complete rewrite of the lexical scanner - the first compilation pass that scans the source text -
so I had been putting it off. Now it’s done!</p>

<h3 id="syntax-summary">Syntax summary</h3>

<p>The scanner will produce tokens INDENT and DEDENT upon increases and decreases in the indent level.
These have the same semantic meaning regarding scope structure as { and } did previously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a decrease doesn’t match an earlier indent level an <em>inconsistent indentation</em> error is generated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A sub-scope is preceded by a header, which ends with a colon and a newline, and is demarcated using an increased indent.
(A missing INDENT after COLON NEWLINE is an error.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if i &gt; 0:
    do_this()
    do_that()
else:
    do_other_stuff()
do_in_any_case()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Semicolons are now optional. A newline is in most cases sufficient statement terminator.</p>

<p>One-liners are written like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if flag: v = 128; else: v = 256
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>

<p>Most programming languages do not use significant whitespace. Instead they use explicit printable tokens,
such as begin/end or { }. This makes it easier to implement parsers,
easier to programmatically generate source code (or embed source code within other files and programs),
and reduces risks of ambiguities in the grammar.</p>

<p>Explicit scope / suite enclosure also makes it easier to format statement lines and blocks as the
programmer sees fit. One can distribute a long statement across several lines,
or list several short statements as a concise one-liner. It separates source formatting from program logic.</p>

<p>If indentation is significant it means the tabs-or-spaces question is no longer entirely facetious.
In any given source text one or the other must be chosen. Although the parser can count both tab and space
characters just fine, it is debatable how many spaces shall correspond to a tab,
and above all they are not visually distinguishable.
Mixing tabs and spaces leads to ambiguity for the programmer, and is therefore disallowed.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-curly-braces">Good-bye curly braces</h3>

<p>Python popularized the indentation-defined syntax and showed it can be combined with a largely elegant and
unambiguous grammar if the whole language syntax is designed with this approach in mind.</p>

<p>Curly braces are clear in meaning and stand out visually. But above all they are for the benefit of the parser,
not the programmer. Braces (or begin/end keywords) make it significantly easier to parse blocks and program structure.</p>

<p>A good programmer will indent the code consistently anyway. Braces only rarely convey meaning to a human reader
that isn’t already apparent from the indentation, which means they are typically redundant to the human.
If they are redundant they add noise that the programmer must look past, and if they also stand out visually
more attention must be spent on it.</p>

<p>In short, braces are for parsers and indentation is for programmers. Tuplex strives to impose a minimum of syntactic
and grammatical artefacts, and eliminate redundancy and boilerplate as much as possible. Thus the choice to 
reduce visual friction rather than make parser implementation easier.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-semicolons">Good-bye semicolons</h3>

<p>Semicolons are optional, for much the same reasons as braces. The newline is in most cases a very natural statement
terminator. Semicolons may still be specified, for example to denote the empty (no-op) statement, or to separate
multiple statements on the same line.</p>

<p>Some statements get very long, for example long argument lists and complex long condition expressions are not that uncommon.
To facilitate this, a line that ends with a comma will have its linebreak ignored.
And in order to write a long expression across multiple lines it can be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p>Generally, any source text enclosed in (parentheses), [brackets], or {braces} will ignore line breaks.</p>

<h3 id="attempts-at-supporting-both-indentation-defined-and-brace-defined-syntax">Attempts at supporting both indentation-defined and brace-defined syntax</h3>

<p>With the existing grammar parser (built using Bison) there are still some limitations on how smart it can be
parsing the indentation- and newline-defined syntax. This causes some extended one-liner constructs to still
require braces, or an occasional extra semicolon at the end.</p>

<p>I explored a grammar design that would allow for both worlds, both brace-enclosed and
indentation-defined blocks, used and mixed as the programmer sees fit.
However this leads to a bunch of edge cases, and the biggest
problem is that resolving them requires ad-hoc rules for the grammar - there is
no intuitive “obviously correct way” when mixing them.</p>

<p>Consider for example, if allowing brace-enclosed and indentation-defined blocks within each other,
what a consistent treatment of these blocks would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: {
        brace-enclosed body  ## note - INDENT
    }  ## note - DEDENT...
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }

if condition:
    ## can an if-true-body now consist of several brace-enclosed blocks because they have similar indentation?
    {
        body part 1 with its own var-scope
    }
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }
else:
    something_else()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the end, I enabled support for brace-enclosed scopes but disallowed mixing them with indentation-defined ones.
Within braces, INDENT, DEDENT, and NEWLINE are simply ignored (same as between parentheses and brackets).</p>

<h4 id="consistent-rules">Consistent rules</h4>

<p>A couple of specific rules needed to be defined to avoid ambiguities.</p>

<p>A. Within braces, all statements must be terminated with semicolon. (This makes the syntax similar to C et al.)</p>

<p>B. The colon must be on the same line as the preceding statement in order to prevents this sort of ambiguity:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition
    :            ## INDENT
    something()  ## no INDENT...

if condition
    : something()   ## INDENT
      other()       ## inconsistent INDENT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C. One-liner syntax can’t be mixed with indentation body syntax. This is an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: do_this()
    do_that()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>D. Brace-enclosure is needed to support single-line statement suites:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if cond1: do_a(); else: if cond2: { do_b(); do_c(); } else: do_d()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>E. For lambda expressions within statements, an extra semicolon can be necessary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>localFunc := ( a : Int )-&gt;Int : return a * 2; ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Without a custom context-sensitive grammar / recursive descent parser the last semicolon above is hard to
avoid. In the current Tuplex grammar it is necessary.
The first semicolon terminates the lambda body’s statement; the second terminates the assignment statement.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-a-custom-scanner">Implementing a custom scanner</h3>

<p>The lexical scanner needs to understand both line structure, scope structure and token syntax. This
was difficult to implement with the Flex scanner Tuplex was originally built with.
So I built a custom scanner from scratch.</p>

<p>It was quite fun, and ended up being fairly efficient. I did manage to avoid writing an entire
regexp-engine while allowing for a decent amount of flexibility in evolving the lexemes and tokens
of Tuplex. Some benefits of the custom implementation include better support for edge cases in
string formatting syntax and in floating point literals.</p>

<p>One thing it doesn’t quite support at this stage is unicode. Tuplex shall support proper UTF-8 eventually,
but at that point the scanner will need some tweaking to not assume single-byte characters.</p>

<p>Since Bison expects a Lex/Flex interface I also wrote a facade for the scanner to translate between their
handling of line/positions and semantic values of literals. Also, since the previous Flex scanner
handled file reading, I had to write a file-to-memory reader to replace it.</p>

<p>Long-term I will probably replace the Bison-generated parser with a custom one as well, but I’m putting it
off as long as I can. Bison can handle almost everything Tuplex needs. There are some edge cases around
NEWLINE interpretation (e.g. the extra semicolon requirement above),
but I think Tuplex can live with that for the time being!</p>

				<p>Let’s imagine a two person startup where each co-founder is equal and there are no roles.</p>

<p>Now suddenly any number of corporate trappings of software development fall away:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no ‘management’ - neither co-founder can fire the other or set their salary</li>
  <li>There are no dedicated roles like program managers, product managers, marketing, sales - anyone can be
assigned anything</li>
</ul>

<p>One might imagine that in such an environment all <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/project-management-surefire-way-kill-your-software-product">project management</a>
falls away and the startup is a developer utopia. <em>That’s not what happens.</em></p>

<p>Instead all of the pressure to deliver on intermediate milestones remains and <em>we</em> are the bad old boss who get’s blamed when things don’t get done.
So how do we influence productivity in a manager-free environment?</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge theory</a>, influencing behaviour without coercion,
comes to the forefront - maybe it’s really the most important in more corporate settings also but there are
too many distractions to realize.</p>

<p>In startups, things that appear to be gospel truth frequently turn out to just be nudges.
This early paper on <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">lean startup</a>
gives the example of Blue River Technology that very quickly learned that robotic lawn mowers for golf courses
were not a viable market and an automated way to kill weeds without chemicals was.</p>

<p>With the advantage of seven years hindsight two things are obvious:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.husqvarna.com/us/lawn-and-garden/professional/professional-robotic-mowers/automower-for-golf-courses">Robotic lawn mowers for golf courses</a>
are a market.</li>
  <li><a href="http://smartmachines.bluerivertechnology.com/">Blue River Technology</a> builds targeted automation to kill weeds
<strong>with chemicals</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the nudge theory point of view software developers are surrounded by nudges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Language selection - ultimately one can do anything equally in Java and Python with enough effort. However a
language with a HotSpot compiler is going to nudge towards larger, more permanent servers.</li>
  <li>CI/CD tools are a nudge towards quicker deliver cycles.</li>
  <li>Remote technologies are a nudge towards potentially more productive work style options</li>
  <li>Available marketing channels are a nudge towards whatever can be sold via those channels</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-nudges-are-the-result-of-mostly-external-factors-but-some-involve-making-choices-about-our-environment">Some nudges are the result of mostly external factors but some involve making choices about our environment.</h3>

<p>Since tools are a nudge under our control everyone in software development should pay extra attention to them.</p>

    <p>One of the most hotly requested features for years has been to have multi-touch gestures in elementary OS, and with 6.0 I’m excited to say that we will deliver. Like the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/dark-style-progress/">dark style preference</a>, delivering a great multi-touch experience is a little more complicated than it seems on the surface. There have been some 3rd party tools to detect touchpad gestures and then trigger actions after-the-fact, but it wasn’t until recently that we’ve had the technical ability to provide smooth, responsive animations that track 1:1 with your finger movement across a touchpad or touch screen.</p>

<h2 id="window-manager-gestures">Window Manager Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve had the great pleasure of working with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">José Expósito</a>, the author of Touchégg, on our window manager gestures. In elementary OS 6, we use Touchégg Daemon behind the scenes to capture input events and communicate them to Gala, our window manager.</p>

  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for Multitasking View</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the moment, we’re reviewing two proposals: one for the multitasking view and another for switching workspaces directly. Both of these use 1:1 responsive, finger-tracking gestures that can be peeked or canceled at any time. When special animations aren’t available in the window manager, such as when tiling, we fall back to animations built in to Touchégg.</p>

<p>We’re still discussing exactly what the default configuration should be, but work is already underway on System Settings so that you can choose whichever gestures feel most comfortable for you—or choose none at all.</p>

<p>If you’d like to support José’s work on multi-touch gestures for elementary OS 6—and other Linux-based operating systems—you can do so with as little as $2/mo on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>



<h2 id="app-gestures">App Gestures</h2>

<p>In order to make gestures work globally, previous solutions have opted to emulate keyboard shortcuts after a gesture was completed. This is effective, but animations—if they’re provided at all—don’t feel connected to users’ input. Instead, in elementary OS 6 we’re making use of Handy, a library originally developed for <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> and their Open Source phone platform. This means that each app and desktop component must be updated to support gestures individually, which is ultimately a lot more work but a vastly superior experience.</p>

<h3 id="paging">Paging</h3>

  <figcaption>Paging screenshots in AppCenter</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In elementary OS 5, we used Handy to add gestures for switching pages to the applications menu and during onboarding. So far, in elementary OS 6 this has been extended to the Date &amp; Time indicator to switch months in the calendar view and to AppCenter to switch between screenshots. This makes use of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Carousel.html">Handy Carousel</a> widget which also provides a smooth transition between page indicator dots when needed. Our plan is to provide gestures any time pages are used and we’re already tracking issues for Calendar and more.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Another place we’ve implemented gestures is while navigating between panes or views. This is using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Deck.html">Handy Deck</a> widget which contains a concept of next and previous views and shows views in a neat stack. Swipe-to-go-back is now implemented in elementary OS 6 in Feedback, in the Installer and Initial Setup views for configuring locale variants, and in Systems Settings → Keyboard when adding new layouts. Gestures are also now available natively in WebkitGtk and therefore Epiphany also provides swipe navigation for both back and forward.</p>

  <figcaption>Navigating when adding keyboard layouts in System Settings → Keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some more complex navigation situations are in progress such as when navigating between views in System Settings itself and in AppCenter. There are also open issues for navigating in Files and Photos, but development hasn’t yet started there. Working with Handy Deck in these situations has exposed some inefficiencies in the way navigation was implemented previously so not only are we implementing a new feature, but the underlying code is being made more robust and optimized.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>We’re also looking into other uses for gestures as popularized in mobile operating systems, such as swipe to dismiss. In elementary OS 6, you can now dismiss notification bubbles from the desktop with a swipe, and remove them from the notifications indicator by swiping in either direction as well. We haven’t implemented swipe-to-dismiss in other types of lists yet, but we’re open to suggestions! You can follow along with our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/61">progress and plans on GitHub</a>, as well as file feature requests.</p>

  <figcaption>Notification bubbles being swiped away in the new Notification Center</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A quick note about pinch-to-zoom and rotate, at the moment we don’t yet have a way to implement these more complex gestures. We may have to wait until we can provide GTK4 in a Flatpak or for elementary OS 7 before it becomes possible to provide gestures for transforms.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexm_gnome">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> for being available for questions and feature requests as we implement Handy in our apps. He’s been an essential resource and very open to improving Handy for our use cases.</p>

<h2 id="get-early-access">Get Early Access</h2>

<p>If you’re excited by what you read here and want to get your hands on the developer preview of elementary OS 6, you can! GitHub sponsors at the $10/mo or above tier get access to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">daily builds server</a> where you can test the latest and greatest experimental builds, including builds for Pinebook Pro. Subscribing helps us fund the development of elementary OS and brings us that much closer to delivering the final product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Lately I have been analyzing some embedded devices such as routers, and want to share how to emulate, extract, and modify firmware.</p>
<p>We may want to do this for several reasons, such as enabling SSH/telnet to debug a service remotely, adding new features and looking for security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>If you want to dump the firmware from a physical device, you will want to use something such as the CH341A, but it won’t be covered here.</p>

<p>We will need some tools to analyze and emulate firmware, but thankfully the nice folks at Attify have made a specialized VM for analyzing embedded devices.</p>
<p>It comes with <a href="https://github.com/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firmware Analysis Toolkit</a> which we will use to emulate the Netgear WNAP320 firmware, since it works well, and this way buying the hardware is not required to follow along.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.attify.com/attifyos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AttifyOS</a></p>

<p>Now that you have the VM downloaded, and running, open Terminator:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~$ mkdir WNAP320 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> WNAP320
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ wget http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/WNAP320/WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip
</code></pre></div><p>Now we want to run the firmware, and for that we will use Firmware Analysis Toolkit. From their GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firmware Analysis Toolkit (FAT henceforth) is based on Firmadyne with some changes. Firmadyne uses a PostgreSQL database to store information about the emulated images. However just for the core functionality i.e. emulating firmware, PostgreSQL is not really needed. Hence FAT doesn’t use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ <span>cd</span> ~/tools/firmware-analysis-toolkit/
iot@attifyos:~/tools/firmware-analysis-toolkit$ ./fat.py ~/WNAP320/WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip

</code></pre></div><p>Press ENTER and wait a bit, then visit 192.168.0.100 on your browser to make sure everything worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://sophielemos.com/posts/2020-11-21-105833_1918x902_scrot.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For this firmware, it seems the interesting stuff are inside a tar archive. It’s usually not that simple.</p>
<p>Let’s extract it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ unzip WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip 
Archive:  WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip
  inflating: wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware.tar  
  inflating: wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware_Release_Notes.html  
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ mkdir firmware
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ tar -xvf wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware.tar -C firmware
vmlinux.gz.uImage
rootfs.squashfs
enc_dec.config
root_fs.md5
kernel.md5
</code></pre></div><p>The files ending in .md5 are not important, they are hashes of the files to check their integrity:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ cat root_fs.md5 
55e71f05c4dfdcf1ea1a611f05ca371b  -
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ md5sum rootfs.squashfs 
55e71f05c4dfdcf1ea1a611f05ca371b  rootfs.squashfs
</code></pre></div><p>The two files of interest here are: rootfs.squashfs and vmlinux.gz.uImage.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter a file format that we’re unsure about, we can use binwalk.</p>
<p>binwalk will scan the unknown file or archive for file signatures, and is often able to extract it by itself:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ binwalk rootfs.squashfs 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</code></pre></div><p>Great, it is simply a squashfs filesystem. This is a compressed read-only filesystem often used in embedded systems. We will extract it later.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ binwalk vmlinux.gz.uImage 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</code></pre></div><p>It seems this firmware uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-Boot</a> as a boot loader, which is very common in embedded devices. We also have the Linux kernel there. We also can see it’s meant to run on MIPS devices. Most embedded devices run either on ARM or MIPS architectures, as they are more energy efficient.</p>

<p>This is a very easy task, we can either use unsquashfs or binwalk to extract it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# unsquashfs rootfs.squashfs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span>0</span>             0x0             Squashfs filesystem, big endian, lzma signature, version 3.1, size: <span>6329666</span> bytes, <span>1417</span> inodes, blocksize: <span>65536</span> bytes, created: 2018-10-25 08:11:35

bin  dev  etc  home  lib  linuxrc  proc  root  rw  sbin  tmp  usr  var

</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have access to the filesystem, we can do several things such as look for security vulnerabilities or modify the firmware.</p>
<p>This particular firmware has ssh enabled, and I don’t know what the default password for root is, so I will add another user:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# openssl passwd -1 -salt salt super_secret_password
<span>$1$salt$GmyU7Z0gGyVy6JmSUPqHy1</span>
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# chmod <span>777</span> passwd
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# vim passwd
sophie:<span>$1$salt$GmyU7Z0gGyVy6JmSUPqHy1</span>:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# chmod <span>444</span> passwd
</code></pre></div><p>The reason I didn’t change the password of the root user directly, is because firmadyne appears to change the password.</p>
<p>Now that we finished our modification, we need to create a squashfs archive again.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# mkdir firmware_modified
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# mv squashfs-root/ firmware_modified/

                                <h3>Finding your old Geocities Page</h3><p>
                                Unfortunately <b>not every page</b> was able to be archived and therefore there may be a very strong chance that your page has been lost to history :(</p><p>
                                
                                Having said that, the easiest way to find if your <b>Geocities Page</b> has been archived is to use the <b>two search boxes</b> to the top right of this page.
                                </p><ol>
                                    <li>
                                        The Google Search is a powerful search but <b>only returns pages that have been indexed by Google</b> and unfortunately, not every page has been indexed by Google.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The second text box uses our <b>internal search engine</b>, and while not as powerful as the Google Search it does <b>search every page</b> within the <a href="https://www.geocitiesarchive.org/">Geocities Archive</a> website.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                Good luck :)
                                </p><hr>
                                <h3>About Geocities:</h3>
                                <p><b>Geocities</b> was acquired by Yahoo in January 1999 for $3.57 billion in Yahoo stock. Unfortunately the new terms and conditions introduced by Yahoo proved less than popular with the large majority of users as Yahoo stated that it now owned all content within <b>Geocities</b>.
                                After trying to provide a more premium service by offering vanity urls rumors began to surface during 2001 that <b>Geocities</b> would be closing.
                                </p>

And Front was, at first, popular mostly with support teams and other teams that deal with a high volume of customer inquiries. But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.
</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--front-is-worth--1-3b">Valuation: Front is worth $1.3B</h2><p>Today, based on our model, we estimate Front is worth about $1.3B, with a fair share price of $9.5 to $11.</p><p>That’s up 40% from Front’s Series C, which valued the company at about $7.7 per share or $920M post-money. At the time, Front was at $26M ARR growing 5% CMGR6 for a 35x multiple.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we project Front is at about $38M ARR or $3.1M MRR, growing 3% CMGR6.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/731caebc-6ce9-4c26-8451-56f39d4618df_image13.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Applying the 35x multiple from Front’s last round to their current $38M revenue run rate gives us a valuation of $1.3B and an implicit per share price of $11. <a href="https://sacra.com/research/front-initiating-coverage-research-report/access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get the full data set.</em></p><p>Slack, for reference, was growing at 12% CMGR6 at the same ARR. According to our model, Front hasn’t grown at more than 10% CMGR6 since the summer of 2017, with growth hanging steady around 5% CMGR between April 2019 and early 2020, then declining slightly with the onset of COVID-19 in March.&nbsp;</p>

Gartner estimates 1 billion knowledge workers worldwide. A 20% paid conversion rate with $100 - $300 contract value per year per user suggests $20 – 60 billion TAM.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking towards the future, Front’s bear, base, and bull cases hinge largely on whether the company’s growth will re-accelerate or whether it will continue to decline, and if so, how quickly it will do so:</p><ul><li>Our 5-year bull case has Front growing at 70% CAGR and reaching a $19B valuation ($600M ARR at a 30x multiple).</li><li>Our base case has them slowing to a steady 30% growth rate and being valued at a more modest $3.8B ($139M ARR on a 25x multiple).&nbsp;</li><li>In our bear case, Front’s growth slows even further, with the company reaching a …</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

                    <p>For nearly 200 years, the United States continually admitted new states to the Union. But after Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959, expansion halted. Along with America’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691175802/">broader stagnation</a>, population growth has slowed.</p><p>In the 20th century, America defeated fascism and communism. Her hegemony, while marred by myriad missteps, ushered in an era of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and liberty. But if America is to defend her hegemony, she must grow again. Scale is essential for innovation and economic growth and underpins America’s military strength. 330 million Americans simply won’t be able to compete against 1.4 billion Chinese. Globalization and free trade aren’t a substitute for scale either, for they deprive the nation of its autonomy in world affairs.</p><p>The solution is for Canada and Mexico to join the Union—i.e., for Canada and Mexico, or their constituent states, to be voluntarily admitted into the United States. America and her institutions are uniquely suited to accommodating this larger and more heterogenous Union and to forging a common political community. The example of German reunification demonstrates that economic convergence is possible too, as I will explain. In addition to reenergizing America, propelling economic growth, and making Americans better off, this would have extraordinary benefits for Canadians and Mexicans too. In particular, tens of millions of Mexicans could be lifted out of poverty.</p><p>In his excellent recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/"><em>One Billion Americans</em></a>, Matthew Yglesias argues for massive population growth as well, though he proposes achieving this through subsidizing fertility and increasing immigration. In practice, these proposals may not rise to the challenge. If the choice America faces is between decadent decline or renewed growth, an expanded Union may be our best bet for the latter.</p><p>To be clear, I realize that this is a somewhat crazy idea. So don’t take take this essay as a wholesale endorsement of the proposal. But I do think it is an idea worth exploring—if only for the sake of expanding our conception of the possible. I invite you to explore it with me.</p><h2 id="bigger-is-better">Bigger is Better</h2><p>A central concept in growth economics is that of “increasing returns to scale”: essentially, bigger is better. A larger population and a larger market benefits all.</p><p>A larger population enables more innovation. More people means there are more creative minds with new ideas and inventions. In turn, more people means more customers, so a new invention is more profitable, incentivizing firms to invest in research and development. This drives economic growth.</p><p>A larger market also enables more specialization. One city can focus on developing software, another on manufacturing cars, a third on financial services. This specialization makes firms and workers more productive, again driving economic growth.</p><p>Think of it this way. A small country would struggle to support an ambitious space program; the cost would be too high. But a large country <em>can</em> support an ambitious space program; distributed over a large population, the cost per person is manageable. The same principle applies to things like medical research, technological development, and military investment.</p><p>This logic of increasing returns to scale underpinned much of the economic case for globalization. The free exchange of goods and people would make us all better off, the high priests of economics told us. And they were right! We can all enjoy Silicon Valley’s software and Germany’s cars. A German-American pharmaceutical collaboration, headed by Turkish and Greek immigrants, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/biontech-covid-vaccine.html">recently created</a> the first vaccine shown to be effective against Covid-19. The gains to scale through globalization have been extraordinary.</p><p>So, then, the solution to the quest for scale is globalization? We don’t need a larger America after all—free trade agreements like NAFTA are enough?</p><p>The problem with globalization is that it deprives the political community of its autonomy—particularly in that most essential realm of war and peace. The nation can no longer determine its own destiny, but rather becomes dependent and vulnerable and subject to whim of others.</p><p>For instance, as the American establishment has become clearer-eyed about the rise of authoritarian China, they have suddenly realized that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, outsourcing much of America’s manufacturing there was a bad idea. If the Chinese acted on their expansionist ambitions, would America be able to push back—or would we be cowed by the cutoff of the supply of new iPhones and a tanking stock market?</p><p>Even trade with allies who purport to share our values is questionable in this regard. If push came to shove and a general war broke out, could America <em>really</em> rely on the German industrial base to start mass producing weapons? Honestly—probably not. America prevailed in WWII because she could mobilize her epic industrial might to produce an “arsenal of democracy.” If America were once again to find herself in an existential struggle, I fear she would not be able to pull off that same feat again.</p><p>This deprival of the political community’s autonomy is what so many Europeans despise about the European Union. While the cosmopolitan elite may identify as “European,” first and foremost most Germans still think of themselves as German, most French people still as French, and most Britons still as British. Their political community is their nation, not the EU. So when an EU technocrat—someone they didn’t elect, much less identify with—tells them how to live their lives, they rebel.</p><p>This has led to an instinct of retrenchment and a push to reverse globalization, most famously Trump’s trade wars. What this gets right is how interdependence has undermined America’s independence. If America can’t defend her core interests and values because she is entirely dependent on others, her hegemony becomes a farce.</p><p>What this gets wrong is that America, alone, with its puny 330 million people, will not be able to compete. America’s hegemony rests on her economic might, sustained by her roaring engine of innovation. America’s economy in turn supports her dominant military. But without the benefits of scale, America will not be able to sustain her economic primacy. 1.4 billion Chinese will be able to outpace and out-innovate 330 million Americans if they try go it alone.</p><p>Without scale, America will decline; her hegemony will wither. But increased scale through globalization robs America of her freedom to act; her hegemony become toothless. How, then, to square the circle?</p><p>There is one possibility. Rather than enmeshing America with foreign countries, make America itself bigger! Enlargen the political community! A bigger nation can enjoy the innovation and specialization made possible by scale. But it also retains its autonomy. Though larger, the nation is still a coherent political community that can determine its own fate.</p><p>Arguably, this is what America has always done. It expanded from one coast to another and rapidly grew its population. That’s how America became the hegemon in the first place, replacing the smaller British. But America now stagnates: her territory fixed, her population growing ever-more slowly, ultimately unable to keep pace with the world’s rising powers. If America wants to preserve her hegemony, she must grow again.</p><h2 id="growing-america">Growing America</h2><p>A bigger America is exactly what Matthew Yglesias argues for in his excellent recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/"><em>One Billion Americans</em></a>. Yglesias envisions this growth occurring through increased fertility and immigration—with the goal of, as the title indicates, a population of 1 billion. Directionally, this is sound. But, realistically, Yglesias’s proposals won’t get us anywhere close to the massive population growth he imagines.</p><p>America’s birth rate is already substantially below the replacement level. We could count ourselves lucky if Yglesias’s suite of proposed pro-natalist policies even got us back to replacement. Extensive family benefits like the ones he proposes have been tried in Europe, and they <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/taking-one-billion-americans-seriously/">haven’t yielded</a> a massive baby boom.</p><p>Similarly, America could definitely accommodate—and benefit from—significantly increased immigration. But I think Yglesias underestimates the political challenge of bringing in the requisite number—hundreds of millions—of immigrants. Sure, theoretically, we could raze our cities and build a sea of skyscrapers in their stead to accommodate the newcomers. But the forces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYism</a> in America are already so strong as to block nearly all new construction in our powerhouse metropolises. Sure, theoretically, we could remake the cultural and ethnic mix of our communities with new arrivals of all colors and creeds. But the forces of nativism in America are already so strong as to barely tolerate the current level of multiculturalism. In his wonderful optimism about America, Yglesias forgets the deep sclerosis that has beset the country. Practically speaking, immigration could yield a few tens of millions more Americans, not <em>One Billion Americans</em>. That is very much worth doing, but it is not enough.</p><p>We need a different proposal. We need a proposal that can rise to the magnitude of the challenge, achieving massive growth rapidly, while also being practically possible. We need Canada and Mexico to join the Union.</p><p>This is not some “globalist” project; this is not an attempt to erect some supranational “North American Union” like the EU. The goal would not be to have Canadians, Mexicans, and Americans somehow coexist in a supercharged version of NAFTA. Rather, it would be to make Canadians and Mexicans Americans—to make them part of the political community. It would be an affirmation of the nation; a reinvigoration of the age-old project of the United States; a fulfillment of the American destiny.</p><p>Accepting Canada and Mexico into the Union would inject the nation with new lifeblood: young men and women eager to work hard, entrepreneurial minds with …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/index.html">Java Language Specification</a> specifies in minute
detail the grammar and semantics of the Java Programming Language. It also includes platform features
like the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.2">loading of classes and interfaces</a>,
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.7.4">service provisioning</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7">annotations</a>
that can provide runtime and compile-time information for meta-programming.</p>

<p>With all these features, I think it’s fair to consider <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html">Java Standard Edition</a>,
or Java SE, as a framework in its own right.</p>

<p>It is not to be confused with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javaee-8-sdk-downloads.html">Java EE</a>, or
Java Enterprise Edition <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> (recently rebranded as <a href="https://jakarta.ee/">Jakarta EE</a>), which adds <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/">loads and loads of APIs</a>
against which Java programmers can create huge enterprisey things on top of
<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/pages/3.0/jakarta-server-pages-spec-3.0.html">JSPs</a> and <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html">Servlets</a>,
for example.</p>

<p>Java EE was all the rage in the early 2000’s, but these days
you’re more likely to find Java software based on things like <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> and its more
streamlined version <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>, or even trendier things like
<a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a> and <a href="https://quarkus.io/">RedHat’s Quarkus</a> (I know it must be very cool because its slogan is
<em>SUPERSONIC SUBATOMIC JAVA</em>), both of which promise to make Java more Kubernetes/Cloud/Microservice friendly <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>What you’re very unlikely to see is Vanilla Java being used in the real world.</p>

<p>By Vanilla Java, I mean just Java SE, without any frameworks, making use of only small libraries, where it makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term “Vanilla Java”, as I am using here, was inspired by our JS friends who coined <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JS</a>
for the “framework” included in every browser since the 1990’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As most people who have had to create complex applications on top of multiple frameworks can attest, frameworks do not
bring only upsides. They bring a lot of downsides too.</p>

<p>If you’re unlucky enough to need something fundamental that is not supported by the framework (or even that is just not
easily found in the documentation), you may need to employ horrible hacks to get things done. Over the years, the number of
hacks might grow so much that you might realize you’ve implemented a second framework on top of your framework to work
around its (perceived or real) limitations.</p>

<p>This is the number one cause of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">big balls of mud</a> appearing in long-lived,
not-so-loved code bases, in my opinion.</p>

<p>What if I told you that you can write applications in Java using just the tools the SE platform provides?
What if in doing so, you did not significantly increase the amount of boilerplate code you have to write by a
significant margin when compared with the size of the application you have to write?</p>
<div>

    <img src="https://renato.athaydes.com/images/java-se-framework/electric-light-bulb_1f4a1.png" alt="Light bulb moment">
    </figure>
</div>
<p>Suddenly, there’s nothing to be worked around. Everything you need, you can go and write or change yourself using the
language you know, with the help of whatever library you need (and Java has a library for everything). Searching for
information on your “platform” is a breeze.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I want to show you features of Java SE that you may not have realized are available to you as well,
not only to framework authors.</p>

<p>I will show you how you can create an application that <strong>hot-reloads when you re-compile it</strong> (because yes, that has
been a feature of Java all along, not of any particular framework, though they would like you to think so).
Then, I’ll show how you can create your own annotations and use them to magically generate code to do what you want,
so you can still avoid having to write tedious code that sinks productivity.
Finally, I will show how you can write and run tests without any framework, using JUnit as a library and CLI.</p>

<p>We will do all this while using <strong>no build system</strong> at all, just a few helper libraries, because after all, we are not
savages: we do want to benefit from the free work of others to get our shit done quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each section of this blog post will have a link to the relevant branch of the <a href="https://github.com/renatoathaydes/raw-jse">raw-jse</a>
repository I’ve created to accompany it. The links look like the one shown below, with a checkered flag representing
each <em>checkpoint</em> we’ve accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<h2>Hot Reloading a Java SE App</h2>

<p>🔄</p>

<p>The first thing we need to stay productive while writing a new application is hot-reloading.</p>

<p>If you haven’t had hot-reloading before, you might think this is a minor improvement over whatever your current situation
is and as such it’s not a must-have. You would be mistaken.</p>

<p>It’s huge to be able to re-compile your application and immediately see the results in front
of you. It’s better than a REPL because it’s your actual code running, not just some snippet you’re playing around with!</p>

<p>To get hot reloading in Java is not hard. You just need to split up your application into a kind of loader application
which never changes, and a dynamic part which you can hot swap at will.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, there’s no way to hot swap ALL of your code unless you attach a debugger to it
(which allows only very limited hot swapping) or use black magic related to <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-management-extensions">JMX</a>
(which I think is what JRebel used to do).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a blog post years ago about <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/4freewaystohot-swapcodeonthejvm">4 different ways to hot-reload code</a>
on the JVM. The method I will show here is fundamentally different, though, as it will work without a debugger,
without enabling JMX and is almost certain to work with any Java version, even with Java 16-EA, because we’re only
using the SE platform, nothing else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To demonstrate hot reloading, I’ll create a simple application class that implements <code>Runnable</code>. Every time we
re-compile the application, it will re-run the application class (this re-compilation itself can also be automated
easily via a small bash script or your IDE).</p>

<p>In a real app, this would be something like a HTTP request handler, or <code>Controller</code> as people like to call it,
but to start with, this example should do.</p>

<p>Here’s our super complex first implementation:</p>
<pre><span>public</span> <span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Starter</span> <span>implements</span> Runnable <span>{</span>
    @Override
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        System<span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span> <span>"Starter running!"</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>If we just ran this from <code>main</code>, we couldn’t re-compile it and expect the JVM to let us re-define the class later.
Even if we could do that, we would eventually run into trouble when we kept state somewhere (think of a cache for
example) and then re-defined the classes that state depended upon.</p>

<p>We need to, as I said in the introduction, split up our application classes that we want to be able to reload from
the application engine, which will be static.</p>

<p>Let’s call our application engine <code>framework</code> because that’s what it is replacing for us. You may think that writing
our own framework is no better than using an existing framework, but the point is that this is not a generic framework,
it’s a framework we’re writing to do exactly what our particular application needs to do. As you’ll see, it’s going to
stay simple because it has a hugely simpler job than a generic framework that needs to be able to do everything, a
patently impossible goal that we’re staying well clear of.</p>

<p>We should keep the <em>framework</em> classes and the <em>app</em> classes in separate compilation units (or modules).</p>

<p>The framework will need two things, a <code>Main</code> class to bootstrap the app and hot reload it, and a <code>WatchDir</code> class
to monitor the app compilation directory for changes, so it can automatically reload the classes when they change.</p>

<p>The final result should look something like this in your file system:</p>
<pre>.
├── app
│   ├── app.iml
│   └── src
│       └── Starter.java
├── framework
│ ├── framework.iml
│ └── src
│     ├── Main.java
│     └── WatchDir.java
└── raw-jse.iml
</pre>
<p>The <code>.iml</code> files are created by IntelliJ because even though I dislike heavy frameworks, I like IDEs very much.</p>

<p>If you’re curious how to create the above structure in IntelliJ, just create a simple Java project without build tools or
libraries, then do <code>File &gt; New &gt; Module...</code> for <code>app</code> and <code>framework</code>, then create the Java classes.</p>

<p>The <code>WatchDir</code> class uses Java’s <code>FileWatcher</code> as shown in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/examples/WatchDir.java">Oracle Tutorial</a>,
which I basically copied, then simplified to call a lambda a couple of seconds after changes were detected, but only if no
more changes occurred in the previous couple of seconds (so the compiler can keep writing class files and we’ll only load
them once the compiler stops doing work).</p>

<p>This is what <code>Main.java</code>’s <code>main</code> function looks like:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Main</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>final</span> AtomicReference<span>&lt;</span>AppRuntime<span>&gt;</span> appRef <span>=</span> <span>new</span> AtomicReference<span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>final</span> String appClassName<span>;</span>

    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span> String<span>[</span><span>]</span> args <span>)</span> <span>throws</span> IOException <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span> args<span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>!</span><span>=</span> 2 <span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            System<span>.</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span> <span>"Usage: java Main &lt;classpath-dir&gt; &lt;runnable-class&gt;"</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>
            System<span>.</span><span>exit</span><span>(</span> 1 <span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
        var classPathDir <span>=</span> <span>new</span> File<span>(</span> args<span>[</span> 0 <span>]</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>
        var appClassName <span>=</span> args<span>[</span> 1 <span>]</span><span>;</span>
        <span>new</span> Main<span>(</span> classPathDir<span>,</span> appClassName <span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// more code...
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>As you can see, we take the classpath of the app and its <code>Runnable</code> class as arguments, create a <code>WathDir</code> instance
to watch over the classpath, and let it call <code>this::swapApp</code> when it is re-compiled.</p>

<p>We keep an <code>AtomicReference&lt;AppRuntime&gt;</code> so we always know which app is currently loaded.</p>

<p><code>AppRuntime</code> is a simple data class:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppRuntime</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>final</span> Class<span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>&gt;</span> appClass<span>;</span>
    <span>final</span> URLClassLoader loader<span>;</span>

    AppRuntime<span>(</span> Class<span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>&gt;</span> appClass<span>,</span> URLClassLoader loader <span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>appClass</span> <span>=</span> appClass<span>;</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>loader</span> <span>=</span> loader<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>The <code>swapApp</code> method is very simple:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Main</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// omitted code...
</span><span></span>    
    <span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>swapApp</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>B-tree</td>
<td>B<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>
<td>B<sub>link</sub>-tree</td>
<td>DPTree</td>

<tr>
<td>wB<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>
<td>NV Tree</td>
<td>FPTree</td>
<td>FASTFAIR</td>

<td>FAST</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/rum.png" width="50%">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

This is a shame because I’m sure there are products out there that I could have benefited from but it was just too difficult to get something up and running.</p><p>Release is the easiest way to create environments from any code change, Pull Request or the click of a button. We deploy your environments in a Kubernetes cluster that’s completely managed for you. <em>But in order to see how Release can change how you build software, you have to get your application running in Release.</em> Most of the time this is pretty straightforward, but there is definitely a setup curve to get over before you can see our product in full form. </p><p>The best technical products I’ve used always have a TON of great examples.  Stripe is definitely the king of this idea… we were just recently integrating their checkout feature into Release and <a href="https://github.com/stripe-samples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">their examples repo</a> is a model for how this can be done. It made our integration with Stripe so much easier than digging through docs to figure this all out.</p><p>I think examples are highly under-done, especially with highly technical products. I’m pretty sure I know why (especially after this project): it’s hard to spend the time and energy building out examples when you have features to build. But at Release, examples are a first class citizen and we believe will make getting up and running with Release easier.</p><h2 id="awesome-compose-is-awesome">awesome-compose is awesome</h2><p>As we started building and testing Release, we came across this fantastic repository, <a href="https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose</a>, that has community created applications known to work with docker-compose. </p><p>Since Release can easily use a docker-compose file to create blueprints for environments, this was a perfect way for us to test out Release and make sure all the various ways docker-compose files are used are supported in the platform. Enter awesome-release</p><h2 id="awesome-release-is-awesome">awesome-release is awesome++</h2><p>We put together an <em>awesome</em> organization in Github with a ton of repositories that just work in Release that are derived from awesome-compose.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/awesome-release" title="Awesome examples running in Release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/awesome-release</a> is chock full of amazing projects that just work. The great part about all of these projects is that they show the range of how making simple applications to complex applications can be run and environments created within Release.</p><p>So if you’re getting started and need a project that will just work out of the box, I highly recommend forking or copying any of these repos and use it to create an app in Release. Every repository in <em>awesome-release</em> just works.</p><p>We’ve made modifications to some of the awesome-compose repos that needed slight tweaks. In each README we’ve described what we did to make the project work. Most of these things are minor adjustments that enable the project to run in a hosted Kubernetes environment vs being run locally via docker-compose.</p><p><a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Click here to signup for Release and give it a shot!</a></p><p>Please let us know if there is an example you’d like to see and we’ll put it together for you. Just send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@releaseapp.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">support@releaseapp.io</a> and we’ll add it to the list.</p><p><strong>Have fun and happy Releasing!</strong></p></div></article></div>]]>

      <h4>Popular usage of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ adds to misunderstanding of AI as it exists today.</h4>
      
      </div><div>
      <h2 id="the-options">The Options</h2>
<p>Definitions of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ tend to fit one of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‘field of research’ definitions, e.g.: “a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers” (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence">Merriam-Webster</a>) , “the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence” (Oxford)</li>
  <li>‘machine intelligence’ definitions, e.g.: “the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior “(<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence">Merriam-Webster</a>) , “intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Wikipedia</a>) , “the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.” (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>)</li>
  <li>‘intelligent entity’ definitions, e.g.: “a computer, robot, or other programmed mechanical device having [the] humanlike capacity [to perform operations and tasks analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as speech recognition or question answering]”. (<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence">Dictionary.com</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>While all of these options are similar in that they deal with ‘intelligent behavior’ in computers, they are also quite different. The first refers to a research discipline, while the second and third describe what that research discipline seeks to create. The ways in which the term ‘AI’ can be used depend on which of these definitions you consider valid. For instance, news articles often have titles to the effect of “Google’s new AI learned X” or “A new AI can do Y,” such as:</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/artificial-intelligence-develops-its-own-non-human-language/530436/">“An Artificial Intelligence Developed Its Own Non-Human Language”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90455358/ai-can-now-design-cities-should-we-let-it">“AI can now design cities, but should we let it?”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danadovey/2020/02/11/first-time-ever-artificial-intelligence-develops-drug-candidate/">“For The First Time Ever, A Drug Developed By AI Will Be Tested In Human Trials”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/google-s-ai-built-it-s-own-ai-that-outperforms-any-made-by-humans">“Google AI creates its own ‘child’ AI that’s more advanced than systems built by humans”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But, such usage (“An AI Developed”, “AI can now”, etc.) is only valid with that third ‘intelligent entity’ definition. If the first ‘field of research’ definition is chosen instead, these titles would have to be rewritten as “Google’s new AI algorithm learned X” or “A new AI system can do Y.” In this piece, I’ll make the case that this definition and form of usage is superior to the alternatives, and should be adopted in most cases.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-we-care">Why Should We Care</h2>
<p>It may seem pedantic to say one of these definitions is better than any of the others, and tempting to just say all of them are fine. However, I argue that the ‘field of research’ definition of AI is better than the alternatives, primarily because of the <a href="https://www.aimyths.org/ai-has-agency">common misunderstanding</a> that AI programs today are independent agents with some amount of ‘free will’. In fact, what AI researchers and engineers build today are just computer programs, which are capable of emulating some aspects of human intelligence but are otherwise (for the most part) no more independent than the apps on our smartphones. Nevertheless, AI researchers recently ranked the idea that the AI algorithms they create have some human-like independence as the most common and problematic myth about AI; it was “number one by a long shot” <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/podcast/top-ai-myths">according to a survey</a> asking which myths about AI are most common.</p>

<p>I believe part of why this myth is so predominant has to do with thinking of AI in terms of the ‘intelligent entity’ definition type and using the term accordingly by saying statements such as “A new AI can do Y”. Expanding that statement results in “A new Artificial Intelligence can do Y,” and the notion that the sentence refers to ‘An Intelligence’ inevitably implies agency similar to those of animals and humans. AI researcher Julian Togelius addresses this notion well in his blog post <a href="http://togelius.blogspot.com/2017/07/some-advice-for-journalists-writing.html">“Some advice for journalists writing about artificial intelligence”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Keep in mind</strong>: There is no such thing as “an artificial intelligence”. AI is a collection of methods and ideas for building software that can do some of the things that humans can do with their brains. Researchers and developers develop new AI methods (and use existing AI methods) to build software (and sometimes also hardware) that can do something impressive, such as playing a game or drawing pictures of cats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AI researcher Zachary Lipton made this point more bluntly:</p>

<figure>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear world (CC <a href="https://twitter.com/businessinsider?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@businessinsider</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Hamilbug?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Hamilbug</a>):
stop saying "an AI". AI's an aspirational term, not a
thing you build. What Amazon actually built is a "machine learning
system", or even more plainly "predictive model". Using
"an AI" grabs clicks but misleads <a href="https://t.co/0kdTLBsrHJ">https://t.co/0kdTLBsrHJ</a></p>—
Zachary Lipton (@zacharylipton) <a href="https://twitter.com/zacharylipton/status/1050221929477664768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October
11, 2018</a></blockquote> 
</figure>

<p>As someone who has tried to use my knowledge as an AI researcher to address popular misconceptions about AI, I have observed and continue to observe the usage of “An AI” often, and think it has the negative side effect of feeding misunderstanding of what AI is today. While it may be tempting to once again say this is being pedantic and that it’s fine to have a more ‘pop culture’ view of AI, with AI becoming increasingly embedded in our society it is more important than ever that all of us understand it. Such understanding is crucial so that we can collectively correctly focus on the most pressing issues with respect to AI (such as bias, automation, its use for surveillance, its safety) and not the issues that the agency myth implies (its potential to go rogue a la Skynet in the near term).</p>

<p>Therefore, given the existence of the ‘agency’ myth with respect to AI and the importance of correctly understanding what AI is actually like today, I would argue the first ‘field of research’ definition of the term ‘AI’ is better than the alternatives. As I’ll show next, this is (unsurprisingly) typically how AI researchers themselves use the term.</p>

<h2 id="how-researchers-define-ai">How Researchers Define AI</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>, one of the founders of the field of AI, defined AI as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Christopher Manning</a><a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf"> </a> <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf">recently cited</a> this as the definition of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ in his summary of definitions of terms related to AI. Similarly, in “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig defined AI as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To cite just one more example, in “The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_John_Nilsson">Nils J. Nilsson</a> defines AI as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[the] activity devoted to making machines intelligent”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are of course many other definitions, but they tend to share the quality of considering AI a research or engineering discipline rather than a term that can be used to refer to singular algorithms or systems.</p>

<p>I conducted an informal survey to check whether AI researchers generally agree with this form of definition, with the following results:</p>

<figure>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>AI Researchers: how do you define the term 'Artificial Intelligence'? </p><p>A: the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs</p><p>B: intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence of animals</p><p>C: Other</p></div>— Skynet Today (@skynet_today) <a href="https://twitter.com/skynet_today/status/1326239401912004611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  
</figure>

<p>While hardly a careful study of what most AI researchers feel, the result of this poll agrees with my personal observations as an AI researcher that most in the field seem to prefer the John McCarthy definition of AI to the alternatives. I point this out because I think it further lends credence to the idea that the ‘field of research’ definition that does not allow for “An AI” as a phrase is superior to the alternatives. Granted, no one has any right to impose a particular way of defining terms on others, but I still think using the term ‘AI’ the same way the people actually working on AI in the real world (as opposed to science fiction, where ‘An AI’ is appropriate) makes a lot of sense.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>AI researchers tend to define ‘Artificial Intelligence’ to mean something along the lines of “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs” – the ‘field of research’ definition. This is in contrast to definitions often used in popular media, which use ‘AI’ to refer to particular programs or systems with sentences – the ‘intelligent entity’ definition. The latter usage of AI reinforces an already common myth that present day AI has some amount of human-like agency, when in fact this is not really the case. Therefore, I believe that the ‘intelligent entity’ type definition should be avoided in favor of the ‘field of research’ definition, and the term should be used accordingly.</p>

Is meat bad for you?</h2><p>For most of us conscious eaters, these questions seem inconsequential and their answers obvious, easily confirmed by the growing trend of plant-based meat alternatives and the abundance of scientific data indicting meat for our health woes.</p><p>Athletes and celebrities like Kyrie Irving, Serena Williams, Joaquin Phoenix, and James Cameron proudly sport vegan lifestyles. Films like <em>What The Health</em>, <em>The Game Changers</em>, and many others praise the benefits of a plant-based diet. In most circles, the supremacy of plant foods is simply unquestioned. It has become an incontrovertible truth, one we've all known since as far back as we can remember, echoes of mom saying "finish your veggies" reverberating in our skulls.</p><p>But what if we were wrong?</p><p>What if you took the two banal questions at the top and flipped them on their heads:&nbsp;</p><p>Are vegetables <em>BAD</em> for you? Is meat <em>GOOD</em> for you?</p><p>These might be more interesting questions to explore. Asked in this way, instead of confirmation bias tending toward the already widely accepted convention of “plants good, meat bad,” we might try to prove or disprove the opposite.</p><p>I am by no means the first one to ask these questions. Apparently, I'm not even in a small minority here. When I first started looking into the carnivore diet, I was astonished at just how many people were experimenting with it and how much information was being shared around it. Even more, I was surprised that... a lot of it made sense.</p><p>The main thing that resonated with me was the biological perspective on the organisms we eat for nourishment. From middle school science class, I remember learning that every living organism has two basic imperatives: </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>survive, and</li><li>reproduce.</li></ol><p>If you apply this lens to the things we eat, you start to understand how some people might believe that vegetables can be bad for you, that plant foods, not meat, are to blame for the laundry list of our health problems, mostly by way of<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/"> chronic inflammation</a>.</p><p><em>(Indeed, "chronic inflammatory diseases are the most significant cause of death in the world.” They include stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disorders, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 49 percent of people hospitalized for COVID-19 had preexisting hypertension, 48 percent were obese, and 28 percent had diabetes. All three are symptoms of chronic inflammation.)</em></p><p>For biological imperative number one, survival, an animal's tactics include speed, camouflage, claws, fangs, and occasionally poison. A plant, on the other hand, can't run away or physically fight back. Its first line of defense against being eaten is often a thick barrier, like bark or a cuticle, and possibly hard shells, thorns, or spines. If the exterior defense is breached, a plant's primary survival mechanism generally comes down to chemical warfare: toxins and enzymes that deter, harm, or even kill animals that ingest them.</p><p>Plant metabolites like alkaloids can produce noxious fumes or repugnant tastes, or cause excessive stimulation (caffeine) or lethargy (opioids). Other compounds like glycol cyanide, found in cassava roots, release cyanide upon ingestion. Still more deadly compounds produced by plants, like cardiac and steroidal glycosides, can cause nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, convulsions, or death if ingested.</p><p>Importantly, some plants approach survival as a long game, at the species level, with a focus on the second biological imperative: reproduction. They take the view that the best defense (survival) is a good offense (reproduction). A fruit- or nut-bearing plant, for example, offers tasty, high-energy snacks that attract mobile eaters, luring them into taking a bite. Being eaten is the goal here, at least in part, so that the eater may disperse the plant's seeds and produce life anew for its progeny. Seeds tend to be heavily protected, often coated in antinutrients like phytic acid or containing cyanogenic glycosides like amygdalin, to ensure they stay intact through the gastrointestinal tract or even get discarded.</p><p>Ultimately, it seems that a plant's survival is dependent on wholly or partially avoiding digestion. So what does that mean for us humans, who persistently prey on potentially pernicious plants? Perhaps, not much.</p><p>If you believe the hype, some high-performing athletes like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Baboumian"> Patrik Baboumian</a> stay at the top of their game by eating almost entirely plants. Yet again, other elite athletes like<a href="https://twitter.com/zbitter"> Zach Bitter</a> consume copious amounts of animal foods, while<a href="https://twitter.com/2min_keto"> some</a> go as far as eating<a href="https://twitter.com/SBakerMD"> only meat</a>.</p><p>So what's going on here?</p><p>To further examine the validity of this unconventional idea, and possibly the flaws in our conventional thinking, I committed to trying the carnivore diet for a month: 30 days, zero vegetables. Actually, no plants whatsoever. Fully aware of my bias favoring meat, I took on a carnivorous way of eating to collect some empirical data and examine three important questions:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Could meat be good for you?</li><li>Could vegetables be bad for you? More specifically to me: Could plant foods be to blame for my chronic pain?</li><li>Could meat be good for the environment?</li></ol><p>I planned the start of this experiment to coincide with <a href="https://www.edlinbetsthefarm.com/blog/why-i-left-san-francisco-tech-to-live-and-work-on-a-farm-part-1">my move from city life to a farm</a> called<a href="https://www.whiteoakpastures.com/?rfsn=4343802.7600d7"> White Oak Pastures</a>, where they practice regenerative agriculture and I could eat, very literally, farm to table. Because as much as the growing interest in carnivory is health motivated, I also believe the ecological impact of meat- and plant-eating is largely misunderstood and could use some good old N=1 analysis.</p><p>But first...</p><h2>What exactly is the carnivore diet?</h2><p>Put simply, the carnivore diet consists of only animal products, but there's a spectrum. My food intake consisted of meat, dairy, eggs, salt, and water. That's it. I didn’t eat anything that contained anything else. No sauces, dressings, etc. No teas or coffee. The ONLY exception I made was bacon. White Oak Pastures bacon is sugar-free but cured with kosher salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, celery powder, and cherry powder.</p><p>If you want to be (even more) extreme about it, the true zealots eat only beef, salt, and water. Some call this the lion diet. Fun fact: the lion is my spirit animal, so I was tempted to go all out, but I thought having the option of cheese every so often would increase the likelihood that I'd actually make it a full month. And bacon. Hard to live without bacon.</p><p>Basically, the carnivore diet is the complete opposite of a plant-based diet. It means no plants whatsoever,<a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme-"> Impossible Foods' imitation heme</a> be damned.</p><h2>Common concerns about an all-meat diet</h2><p>Given our pervasively conventional understanding of diet and health, the first few thoughts that jump to mind when considering a carnivore diet are: What about fiber, won't you get constipated? What about vitamin C, won't you get scurvy? And WHAT ABOUT FIBER? HOW WILL YOU POOP?!</p><p><strong>On vitamin C.</strong> As it turns out, there is vitamin C in beef liver and in eggs. Not as much as in an orange, but in the context of a carnivore diet, these sources provide sufficient levels of vitamin C to avoid scurvy and any real deficiency. According to the<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/worldcarnivoretribe/"> masses</a> in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/carnivoreaureliusnation/?multi_permalinks=3512931485396546"> several</a> different<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PrincipiaCarnivora/"> carnivore</a>-focused<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/donteatthatblog/"> communities</a>, as long as you're eating nose to tail, or at the very least supplementing beef liver, vitamin C deficiency is not a concern.</p><p><strong>On fiber.</strong> Poop, regularity, colon cancer, constipation! You might think a meat-heavy diet would require lots of fiber, but you would be wrong. The supposed importance of fiber in a healthy diet seems to be widely accepted, but it may very well be a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1663443/"> consequence of modernization</a>. Effectively, fiber has been recommended for its supposed metabolic benefit, particularly as it relates to mitigating the adverse metabolic effects of a high-carbohydrate diet. The "benefit" is that fiber slows the digestion of food and hinders nutrient accessibility and absorption. But the context in which these effects are a benefit is that of an unhealthy diet. On a healthy diet, or more specifically here, on a diet low in carbohydrates, the effects of fiber are unnecessary.</p><p>After a moderate level of research, I felt safe to conclude that the alleged benefits of dietary fiber address problems spawned by the modern American diet in the first place, if they address any problems at all. It's more likely that dietary fiber is a soon to be anachronistic idea, its health claims part of an attempt to sell more of a surplus crop, itself the result of an outdated farm subsidy. In fact, the World Journal of Gastroenterology published a study showing that<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/pdf/WJG-18-4593.pdf"> reducing fiber actually reduces digestive issues</a>.</p><p>And if you're concerned about colon cancer, at least two double-blind, randomized clinical trials have shown that neither a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10770980/"> dietary supplement of wheat-bran fiber</a> nor a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12223437/"> high-fiber diet</a> reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma, the precursor to colorectal cancer.</p><p>A fiberless diet seems counterintuitive until you think about babies: for the first 6 months of our lives, humans eat absolutely no fiber yet have no problem filling up diapers.</p><p><strong>On hydration.</strong> While it didn't immediately jump to mind as a concern, a little research revealed that a meat-only diet can mean increased electrolyte loss leading to dehydration. Because a carnivore diet is essentially an extreme form of a Keto diet, my body would be in ketosis and flushing out more salt. This leads to reduced water retention and can result in dehydration. So I planned on drinking two liters of water per day and being generous with salting my meat. I bought a 1-liter Nalgene to easily track my water intake, aiming for two full bottles everyday.</p><p>All that aside…&nbsp;</p><h2>Could meat be good for you?</h2><p>According …</p></div></div></div>

And it’s a shame.  <strong>Marginal gains are about making small incremental improvements to a process (or product, ability or habit etc) which, when added together, make a significant improvement</strong>. But legal innovation often ignores it.  Why? We’ll find out.  We’ll also provide an easy intro to a few mental models that can identify and deliver these gains within your legal organisation, whether law firm or in-house!</p><h2>What are marginal gains?</h2><p>Consistently improving something by 1% isn’t particularly notable, let alone noticeable.  But in the long run it can be <strong>meaningful</strong>.</p><ul><li>If you improve something by 1% each day for one year, you’ll end up <strong>37 times better</strong> by the end of the year.</li></ul><ul><li>Conversely, if you only get 1% worse each day for one year, you’ll <strong>decline down to almost zero </strong>by the end of the year.</li></ul><p>If the principle sounds familiar, you may have heard of similar ideas, e.g. <strong>continuous improvement</strong> or <strong>Kaizen</strong>.  Both continuous improvement and Kaizen have as their goals the ongoing improvement of products or services and the elimination of waste through data-informed iterative analytical improvements.  Many of these improvements will be small, but when added together represent a large improvement.</p><h2>Why care?</h2><h4>It wins gold meals</h4><p>The <strong>marginal gains</strong> theory was popularised by <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/membership?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqdP9BRDVARIsAGSZ8AnEnL5TB7QykSE4kP3duW3orq_qoJcRdjhaogZQtNDxSuQIwcqV99waAlDMEALw_wcB">British Cycling</a>‘s 2008 and 2012 Olympic cycling team.  Prior to 2008, British Cycling was widely regarded as a “laughing stock”.  In an effort to fix things British Cycling hired performance director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brailsford">David Brailsford</a>.</p><p>Brailsford believed that 1% improvements across all aspects of cycling aggregated into a significant performance gain.</p><p>Under his guidance British Cycling implemented all sorts of tiny improvements:</p><blockquote><p>Using antibacterial hand gel to cut down on infections, rubbing alcohol on bicycle tires for better grip, redesigning bike seats for greater comfort, extensive wind tunnel testing of bikes and racing suits etc.</p></blockquote><p>Within 5 years after Brailsford took over, British Cycling won 57% of all road and track cycling gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and at the 2012 London Olympics set 9 Olympic records and 7 world records.</p><p>During the ten-year span 2007 – 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured 5 Tour de France victories.</p><p>Quite a turnaround.</p><h4><strong>Big returns are the accumulation of small wins</strong></h4><p>Over time, the difference between allowing something to worsen by 1% each day vs. improve by 1% each day becomes extremely significant.  Consider the below:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="869" height="348" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png" alt="Marginal Gains Table" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png 869w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-300x120.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-768x308.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-585x234.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>If you start the year with £100 of value and manage to improve that value by 1% each day for 365 days you <strong>37x </strong>that value by year end.  Over time, assuming the same 1% per day incremental improvement, that value balloons to a very large number.</p><p>Conversely, letting that value degrade by 1% each day quickly reduces that value to a very small number.  £100 becomes £2.55 after one year of daily 1% declines! Thereafter it reduces further and further toward, but never reaching zero, although in real (as opposed to mathematical) terms, it hits zero just after 1 year.</p><p>As this graph demonstrates:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png" alt="Marginal Gains Graph 1% better or 1% worse each day for 365 days" width="962" height="584" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png 962w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-300x182.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-768x466.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-585x355.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>Which curve would you prefer to be on? The blue or the red?</p><h4><strong>Small is easier to start</strong></h4><p>If you break down a larger goal, problem or process into smaller steps, it is easier for an individual or organisation to measure, critique, brainstorm solutions for and implement winning improvements over time.  As attractive as double digit improvements sound, they are often hard to contextualise and action, let alone start.</p><h4><strong>Competitive edge</strong> hides in the margins</h4><p>As with the British Cycling example, focusing on 1% marginal gains can create a competitive edge.  This is all the more so given how easily and often marginal gains are overlooked.</p><p>Car manufacturing, where similar principles of continuous improvement and Kaizen originate, paint a similar picture.</p><p><a href="https://www.toyota.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqdP9BRDVARIsAGSZ8Ak7bStcKvAgldLvrbdCHVp9lJGnkGmXSqqk2pAByRvNt3YoNhW3ROIaAnAOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Toyota</a>, pioneer of the <strong><a href="https://www.toyota-europe.com/world-of-toyota/this-is-toyota/the-toyota-way">Toyota Way</a></strong> and derivative principles (e.g. Six Sigma, Lean), used this attention to detail and marginal gains philosophy. In doing so Toyota quickly leapfrogged the US car manufacturing industry in the latter half of the last century, building a lasting reputation as a reliable manufacturer of superior and well priced cars vs. its overpriced and unreliable US counterparts.</p><h2>Why marginal gains are wrongly overlooked</h2><h4>1% returns excite no one</h4><p>Instinctively a 1% improvement to a product or process sounds too small a target. You’re probably aiming higher: 25% or 50%+ gains.</p><blockquote><p>Put it this way: given the choice, would you prefer someone promising a 25% gain today or a 1% improvement each day?</p></blockquote><p>You’d probably choose the 25% gain.  But is that wise?</p><p>As we’ve shown above, ignoring marginal gains is at best, missing out on significant long term gains, and at worst inviting terminal decline.</p><p>Using an admittedly extreme example, if organisation A and B start with the same £100 of value, and A improves by 1% each day whereas B worsens by 1% each day over the course of 365 days, at the end of the year…</p><p>…A’s value is <strong>1,481x </strong>B’s!</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="879" height="163" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png" alt="Marginal Gains Multiplier" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png 879w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-300x56.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-768x142.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-585x108.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>This is the same reason we don’t all have six pack abs: you have to work at them every day, via diet and exercise, to attain and then maintain them.</p><h4>1% each day requires a long term mindset</h4><p>The difference between being 1% better or worse each day is minimal at first.  But as the above graph and example of organisations A and B demonstrated, these differences accumulate and widen significantly over time.</p><p>Most legal organisations are short-termist, and easily disregard the accumulated benefit of 1% gains over a year.  But doing so is giving away a significant opportunity, or worse, inviting terminal decline if your processes and products trend 1% worse each day and a competitor’s improve 1% per day.</p><h4>Legal (spin)innovation, FOMO and Shiny Objects are easier than 1% each day</h4><p>Legal innovation suffers from three ailments:</p><p>1. <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome (SOS).</strong>  Chasing the latest shiny <strong>#legaltech</strong> simply because it is new and in vogue, or overhyped in the press.</p><p>2. <strong>FOMO.</strong> Buying skills and / or software because of a peer firm’s flashy press release.</p><p>3. <strong>Spinnovation</strong>. Focusing on winning awards and issuing glossy press releases.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="472" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gollumfire.gif" alt="Gollum Smeagol Ring Lord of the Rings" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Buying a no code 5G quantum AI blockchain when what you needed was a lava pit free workspace.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In each case, this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_work">busy work</a>. It has the appearance of innovation and is often quite easy, i.e. buy X, announce X… buy Y, announce Y and so on.</p><p>Now we have some logos for a pitch deck, our website or the next conference or media plug.</p><p>But did it change anything for the better?</p><p>Has the customer benefited? Is anyone in the organisation using these tools or applying these newly trained skills? Did they actually need them? Are they able to use them, and use them well? Does the organisation know what it already has and, if not, why not? Of the things it already has, how many are actually used by the organisation, or used poorly? Would there be a higher ROI if you made everyone expert users of Microsoft Office? (Check out <a href="https://craftycounsel.co.uk/boxset/microsoft-office-hacks-for-lawyers">this</a> excellent boxset of how-to videos re Microsoft Office hacks by <a href="https://craftycounsel.co.uk/">Crafty Counsel</a>) Did you just buy something that overlaps 1:1 with another thing you bought last quarter that no one used?</p><p>Why is this?</p><p>Time spent <strong>asking</strong> these questions and <strong>listening</strong> to the answers is time well spent, and better spent vs. diverting resource to press releases, pitch materials and the never-ending consumption of new.</p><blockquote><p>But what is simple to do is simpler to not do. And that is what usually happens.</p></blockquote><p>All too often the legal market chases change via consumption.</p><p>But like buying a new outfit to make you feel good, albeit temporarily, would it be better to buy a gym membership and do the hard yards of diet and exercise to get in shape and look good in a scruffy t-shirt, or better still, naked?</p><p>But as with most things in life, there are few / no silver bullets, despite what vendors promise.  Some of the biggest improvements are the accumulation of small wins made consistently.</p><p>As someone famous once said, a six-pack wasn’t built in a day (OK we made that up, but you get the picture).</p><p>So too with legal innovation, let alone any innovation!  It can’t be bought, but only built.  Brick by brick.</p><h3>And this is where marginal gains slot in</h3><p>The marginal gains technique approaches improvement like a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>It’s not about running full throttle in a short burst, or buying the most expensive running trainers.</p><p>Instead, it’s having the patience to critically and continually assess your diet and form in order to improve, whilst maintaining stamina to keep going for the long term.</p><p>Why bother?</p><p>Focussing on marginal gains – and some techniques to help identify them – may uncover that you already have tools or expertise in your organisation that are under-utilised through lack of awareness, training, buy-in or otherwise.</p><p>Righting these issues can deliver gains without having to buy more things and spread fewer resources across yet more things.</p><p>Likewise, the very issues in your organisation that prevented your existing products or processes from being successfully utilised might also be the very same things that – left unchecked – doom to failure anything new, no matter how shiny or prized by your peers in their spinnovative press release!</p><h2>How to identify, measure and improve via marginal gains?</h2><p>In simple terms: <strong>map your process</strong>.  Identify the pain points. Measure them. Analytically and empirically design, implement, measure and test solutions.  Did it improve? Yes, great.  If not, try again.  Once you get it working, build in controls to ensure the improvements are maintained and new ones identifiable.</p><p>Where are small things eating away at your overall process efficiency?</p><p>If you want a more rigorous framework, you might wish to consider a time tested method such as the Six Sigma concept, <strong>DMAIC</strong>.</p><h3>What’s DMAIC?</h3><p>DMAIC stands for: <strong>define, measure, analyse, improve and control</strong>.</p><p>DMAIC is a five-phase data-driven strategy to improve processes.  It is integral to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma">Six Sigma</a>, but in general, can be implemented as a standalone …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>I Love It! (I Hate It.)</h2><p>There's a sound of rustling paper. You crack the wrap at the seam. You look inside, unveiling the item within. It's...</p><p>Crap. It’s crap. It’s a crap present that you don’t want.</p><p>You lift your head and, with a beaming grin, you <em>somehow</em> manage to let out a torrent of thanks and praise for what you have just received. This is wonderful! It's just what I wanted! How did you know? I love it! I'll treasure it forever!</p><p>Within a day, it's stuffed in a drawer. Within a week, it's forgotten. Within a month, it's on eBay or off to the charity shop. Worse, it just ends up in a landfill somewhere.</p><p>If you had to guess, how many times would you say this has happened to you when you've received gifts at Christmas or on birthdays?</p><p>Here comes the even worse part: now think about how many times this might have happened with gifts<em> that you have given to others.</em></p><p><strong>Think you've got a perfect record?</strong> Think again, because you really, honestly, probably don't.</p><h2>A Lot of Gifts Aren't Actually That Good</h2><p>In 1993 - to cries of 'Grinch!' - economist Joel Waldfogel published a now-infamous paper (among certain economist circles, anyway) titled '<a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/WaldfogelDeadweightLossXmas.pdf">The Deadweight Loss of Christmas</a>'.</p><p>In it, Waldfogel argues that huge sums of money are wasted every year on gifts that nobody really wants. More accurately, he reported that many gift recipients valued their gifts at a dollar amount much lower than was actually paid for the item.</p><p>For example, if I bought you a gift for $100 and you thought that it was actually worth about $70 it would mean that, somewhere along the line, <em>you’ve destroyed $30</em>. Pop! It's gone. You might as well have just taken your cash and burnt it.</p><p>Waldfogel found that anywhere between 10% and 33% of all Christmas gifts cause this kind of loss every year. This is stunning, especially when we extrapolate out to the entire population.</p><p>He concludes by saying that many people could do worse than simply giving cash as a gift because it would carry more value than the actual gifts they might otherwise have bought.</p><p>Unless you are absolutely convinced that you are god's gift to... well, gift-giving, then you're probably seeing the same loss of value with your own gifts. Or, to put it another way, <strong>a lot of your gifts probably suck whether you realise it or not</strong>.</p><p>You won't see this, though, because nobody is going to turn around and tell you that your gifts were 'only 70% good'. If anything, the reactions that we get with a good gift and a bad gift are remarkably similar. Nobody wants to make you feel like a bastard at Christmas, even if you did hand out some absolute clangers.</p><p>But is it so bad, really, losing a few dollars every year? In short, yes. And then some. But not just because of the money you're wasting.</p><h2>Good Gift Giving Is Incredibly Important</h2><p>Outside of bland analysis by economists that ordinary people haven’t heard of, gift-giving helps us maintain and preserve social ties at all of life’s most important occasions; birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's day, anniversaries, graduations... you name it.</p><p>In between these occasions there is usually some kind of imbalance between the gifts that we have given to one another. That is, you might knock it out of the park one year and I might give you something that’s nowhere near as good. Next time, I'm going to want to do much better. This imbalance leads, in part, to the continuation of the tradition.</p><p>Giving good gifts help to form and strengthen social bonds. It helps us show people how much we care, how much we love them. It helps us say sorry. It helps us convey meaning. It helps us have fun and take delight in generosity. A life without giving and receiving gifts would be a dull life indeed.</p><p>On the other hand, giving bad gifts can degrade the quality of those same bonds. <strong>At best, it can be annoying to be given a bad gift. At worst, it can drive people apart.</strong> If Waldfogel's research is correct, an awful lot of us are unwittingly dropping the ball every year, without really realising it.</p><p>Luckily, it's not just economists giving their miserable analysis of the situation; a handful of psychologists have waded in and they're here to tell you that you're just <em>thinking</em> <em>about it all wrong</em>.</p><h2>Why Our Gifts Don't Work</h2><p>There's a surprising amount of research literature out there that all points in a similar direction as to why gifts don't work and what we can do about it. To find a way through this gift-giving minefield, I've gone through some of the most widely-cited papers to get to the bottom of it all. (Citations can be found at the end of this article.)</p><h3>Gift-Givers and Gift-Receivers Think Differently</h3><p>Gifts don't always hit the spot because the psychology of <em>giving</em> gifts is totally different to the psychology of <em>getting</em> gifts. Although it all happens during the same event, we unwittingly think about these two things in totally different ways.</p><p>When people <em>give</em> gifts, they typically want to nail one or more of these four different things:</p><ul role="list"><li>Surprise (the wow factor)</li><li>Desirability (the clout factor)</li><li>Materiality (the price tag)</li><li>Social responsibility (that is, looking virtuous)</li></ul><p>Gift <em>receivers</em>, though? <strong>Their priorities are completely different</strong>. They want:</p><ul role="list"><li>Usefulness (can I do something with it?)</li><li>Versatility (can I do a variety of things with it?)</li><li>Quality (is it well made/going to last?)</li><li>Stuff they've asked for (did I actually say I want this?)</li></ul><p>Given the difference between these two lists, is it any wonder that some gifts simply don't hit the mark?</p><h3>We Focus too Much on The Moment of Exchange</h3><p>When we give gifts we are mostly thinking about 'the moment' in which we hand it over, seeing the reaction of our recipients. We narcissistically want the chorus of 'oohs' and 'aahs' that come with nailing a really good gift that somebody loves. Whether or not those reactions last any longer than the moment of exchange, though, is not something that gift givers really care about.</p><p>Research shows that we make greater errors with gift giving when those gifts are being opened in public - perhaps at a party - than when we give them in private - such as wedding presents.</p><p>This is because<strong> we end up optimising for the maximum showboat potential of the gifts we give</strong> because it feels good to do so well in public. Once the event is over, though, we basically forget about it all. Onto the next thing.</p><p>Not so for the gift recipient. After the party is over and everyone's gone home... they've still got the gift. It matters much more to them what comes <em>after</em> the moment of exchange.</p><p>This means that it's better to buy a gift that has greater long term appeal than just the momentary 'wow' factor, even if it doesn't feel as good to us in the moment.</p><h3>We Like to Be Given Experiences... But We Don't Like to Gift Them</h3><p>Research shows that an 'experience' gift - like a night out at the theatre or a wine tasting course - is often preferred instead of the usual variety of material gifts that get doled out every year.&nbsp;</p><p>The only problem is that gift-givers don't really like to give experiences as gifts because the moment of exchange is relatively dull. This is usually because there's some stand-in that gets handed over - a voucher or a certificate - and the response is likely to be bland at best.</p><p>The <em>real</em> excitement comes much later when they cash that voucher in. But, of course, the gift-giver can’t actually be there to see that happen. No good.</p><h3>We Care too Much About the Price</h3><p>Gift-givers tend to believe that the more generous or pricey a gift is, the better it must be. This rarely works. For recipients, the absolute quality of the gift matters much more. This is equally true for something that the giver thinks is really thoughtful, too.</p><p>This happens when we put an enormous amount of thought and money into a gift for a friend or relative, <strong>only to find that they have no interest in it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A good example of this might be picking up on someone's love for music and then buying them a beautiful acoustic guitar. There's little guarantee that they have any interest in playing an instrument at all, no matter how expensive it is or how much thought you put into it.</p><p>If they're not regularly playing that thing a year later, you’ve probably goofed.</p><h3>We're Too Distant</h3><p>If you're genuinely quite distant from the gift recipient, it's almost impossible to get a good gift for them that they will genuinely want. This means one of two things:</p><ol role="list"><li>You probably shouldn't bother, or</li><li>You can give them cash (or a cash equivalent)</li></ol><p>Whether or not you <em>should</em> give them cash is another question. If they're your grandchildren this is absolutely fine. If they're your grandparents, perhaps not.</p><p>In the latter instance, a good 'consumable' like a decent bottle of wine or a box of chocolates will do. But don't worry about it much more than that.</p><h3>Be Careful With Charity Gifts</h3><p>Sadly, recipients are less grateful about virtuous charitable gifts than we would hope for. While they're good for the cause, they don't score well against the ways in which we normally value gifts. They make the gift giver look good and they feel good in the moment, but they are not valued as much. </p><p>Of course, if someone tells you that they would value a charitable gift then go for it. But don't assume that anybody will actually like it as a gift unless you have discussed it in advance.</p><h2>How to Buy Gifts People Actually Want</h2><p>All hope is not lost. You <em>shall</em> buy gifts that people will actually want! Here's how.</p><h3>Be Realistic About Your Relationship With The Recipient</h3><p>In Waldfogel's 1993 study, there's a chart of gift effectiveness that more or less screams at aunts, uncles and grandparents to simply not bother with material gifts and to give cash instead:</p><figure id="w-node-9f5a4418121f-c39ae183"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8b192239b9b4843e9ae18f/5fbfe9af234e056f30021f18_GTfsGCvFwKV3s1qidXi6Ls7EIYGoOQBVRr8o_3XvvwZ6IHt4QwNvAaje0p8Il8hWv-Yz1jcRU9A98nTmQMijJOrXU6E6gZC5FSi4_f_WOLuJY2XXZtR2CCIEYZsyAMvYo1P60Hr3.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you soulmates, together as a couple for many years? You obviously stand a much higher chance of getting the recipient something they will actually want.</p><p>If you’re anyone else, you will have a harder time and should maybe not worry so much about making sure your gift is as ‘thoughtful’ as possible and just focus on making their gift useful or buying them an experience.</p><h3>...Ask Them What They Want</h3><p>It seems obvious, …</p></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Years ago, we had a big decision to make. In 2013, STH had grown to a size that would seem immeasurably small by the traffic we do today. Still, at that point, we made the decision that it made fiscal sense to leave Amazon AWS for colocation. We chronicled the reasoning in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-sth-leaving-cloud-amazon-aws/">Falling From the Sky Why STH is Leaving the Cloud</a> and then the cost breakdown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-amazon-ec2-vps-dedicated-colocation-options/">Falling From the Sky Part 3 – Evaluating Amazon EC2, VPS, Dedicated and Colocation Options</a>. Since 2013, we have been doing some irregular updates that largely correspond to planned upgrades of our infrastructure. Since we are taking a look at a few upgrades again, it is time to go through the exercise again.<span id="more-48850"></span></p>

<p>If you want to hear this instead of just reading, we have a YouTube video with some commentary here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Our Colocation Hosting versus AWS Costs Compared 2020 Edition" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqetN_i0BnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we can go into a bit more detail below, but some prefer to listen rather than read so we have that option.</p>

<p>In 2018, we looked again at whether it was time to move back to the cloud. In our cost analysis, this is what we found using 1-year estimates:</p>
<figure id="attachment_26722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26722"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-part-4-leaving-the-cloud-5-years-later/sth-2018-web-hosting-budget-v-aws/" rel="attachment wp-att-26722"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg" alt="STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS" width="536" height="156" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg 536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-400x116.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-533x156.jpg 533w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-534x156.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26722">STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to give some sense of how that March 2018 estimate has gone in the 32 months since we looked at this, we ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more bandwidth. STH has grown a ton since 2018. We also focus more on reviews which tend to use more photos. Even with lazy loading images, our bandwidth usage is significantly higher. This did not incur an incremental cost based on how we buy bandwidth. See: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guide-hosting-bandwidth-data-transfer-billing/">Buyer’s Guide to Hosting: Bandwidth, Data Transfer and Billing</a></li>
<li>Several of our VMs doubled memory requirements and we added slightly more storage. We overprovisioned so this was absorbed with still enough leftover.</li>
<li>We replaced a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/9-step-calm-and-easy-proxmox-ve-boot-drive-failure-recovery/">SSD</a>, upgraded a firewall, and added another <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/explaining-the-automatic-transfer-switching-ats-pdu/">ATS PDU</a>. We have not done long-term infrastructure upgrades.</li>
<li>We ended up using an upgraded node that we had available, as a “hot spare”. We tend to “self-warranty” hardware, and so we had an extra system/ chassis there.</li>
<li>We are going to say we used four hours of labor. This includes drive time to the primary data center. Since it is far away (18-20 minute drive), we actually did not go there for several quarters. So over 32 months, we had budgeted $640 for remote hands. We effectively either paid $160/ hr or paid less than that even rounding up to four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it looks like we probably over-estimated self-hosting costs again, and underestimated AWS costs with respect to how much we would spend there, even after service discounts.</p>
<h2>The Late 2020 AWS v. Colocation Update</h2>
<p>We wanted to answer the question of what the picture would look like for hosting STH now. A few quick words before we get there on assumptions.</p>
<p>First off, we completely could change the way we run the site. That is a given. Frankly, running in VMs whether on the cloud or in self-hosting is convenient. Indeed, we run containers in VMs as well. We could also overhaul the entire software stack again, but frankly, we want to spend more time creating content then doing that work. Something that we learned was that we had less reliability by increasing complexity than by keeping things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Second, we are modeling current data transfer, and a minimal set of VMs. We actually have a lot more running, including some services that we run for some of the labs. One could argue that since they are lab services they are part of bringing you STH, but they are not focused on the web hosting aspect so we are going to remove them. Also, we have other VMs that are likely only online because we wanted to try something and had capacity. We may or may not elect to run the VMs if there was the AWS incremental cost. We could model these as on-demand or spot instances, but instead, we are just removing them entirely.</p>
<p>Third, we completely understand spot pricing. We are modeling a basic set instead of adding extras. At some point, we need databases, nginx servers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Fourth, we are going to add a mix of AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon instances roughly about what we use for our hosting. We are heavily weighting the larger instances toward the EPYC instances since that helps bring down the costs and for our workloads, there is no appreciable difference. We could go Arm, but that requires some small lift and shift work.</p>
<p>Finally, we do use some AWS services. Those services we would use regardless so we are excluding them from the analysis. We are also not modeling services such as Mailchimp which handles our weekly newsletter, Teespring that handles our online merch shop, YouTube which hosts our videos, and so forth.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved No Upfront</h3>
<p>Here is the calculator for the absolute base setup for our hosting using 1-year reserved upfront instances:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48851"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-reserved-no-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront" width="1114" height="222" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg 1114w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-400x80.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-800x159.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-696x139.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-1068x213.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48851">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, our hosting costs are just under $4,300 per month.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Swapping to 1-year reserved partial up-front on the instances helps bring pricing down a bit albeit with a $19,512 up-front cost.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48853"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-partial-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48853"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront" width="1112" height="242" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg 1112w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-400x87.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-800x174.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-696x151.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-1068x232.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48853">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>When we factor in the up-front we get a $4,137.63 monthly cost along with a $49,651.56 total annual cost for the year. We are not discounting here using future values/ present values. There is a big issue with this. Typically, we tend to see our servers run for years. To model that, we tend to use 3-year reserved partial upfront.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 3-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Using the 3-year reserved partial upfront on the instances gives us a much lower operating cost with a larger up-front payment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48852"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-3-year-partial-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48852"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 3 Year Partial Upfront" width="1117" height="247" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg 1117w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-400x88.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-800x177.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-696x154.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-1068x236.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1117px) 100vw, 1117px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48852">2020 AWS Calculator 3 Year Partial Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>First off, the $39,020 is more than we have spent in the last three years on hosting hardware. We do not purchase machines with long warranties or high markups, so if you are buying the average Dell/ HPE/ Lenovo server and think that sounds like a single server, you are trading higher upfront costs for service contracts. Given what we have seen on hardware/ remote hands, it is not a model we are pursuing. On the operating side, we get down to $1,968.51 per month which is great.</p>
<h2>STH 2020 Hosting Budget</h2>
<p>Next year, we will likely do two small changes. First, we will upgrade database nodes and instead of using Optane SSDs, we will move to Cascade Lake and Optane PMem DIMMs into the database servers and upgrade a few older nodes to AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” systems. We are testing the Ampere Altra 80-core server right now, and we are at the point where we might consider using Arm in the hosting cluster this year. We are going to increase our hardware budget to $10,000 this year. Although we did not use most of our hardware budget in 2019 nor 2020, we expect to in 2021.</p>
<p>Making up our monthly cost, we increased a bit for inflation. We used a $895/ mo budget in 2018. Our costs are effectively flat, but we are going to assume a bit more labor to install servers/ upgrade the hardware.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48855"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-v-self-hosting/" rel="attachment wp-att-48855"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg" alt="2020 AWS V Self Hosting" width="685" height="197" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg 685w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting-400x115.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48855">2020 AWS V Self Hosting</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are budgeting $22,000 per year or around $1833.33 per month. This is about the same as we would need for EC2’s 3-year partial upfront reserved instance, albeit without the up-front costs.</p>
<p>The one item that skews this substantially, is that we are not replacing every node every year. We are now in a very different place than we were when we started this journey. We have existing infrastructure that is frankly fine from a performance and node count standpoint even though we have relatively under-invested over the past 32 months. We had budgeted around $1687/ month for the last two months and spent under $1000. Still, at some point, we like to replace equipment before it fails.</p>

<p>There is clearly a lot going into this. We now have just under 8 years since this 10U colocation spot in Las Vegas was our first setup:</p>

<p>What is not reflected in our discussion is all of the lessons learned along the way. Also, as hardware has gotten faster, and memory prices have decreased, the cost of self-hosting has gone down significantly for our applications. We are also taking advantage of falling bandwidth prices. While AWS is absolutely the right choice for many applications, and indeed we use them, for our web hosting it is not what we want for a simple and inexpensive setup. This may not be the perfect analysis, but it is a little bit of how we now look at hosting at STH.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Prometheus's query language <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/">PromQL</a> is one of the cornerstones of the Prometheus ecosystem. Back in our August blog post, <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/08/06/comparing-promql-correctness-across-vendors">Comparing PromQL Correctness Across Vendors</a>, we looked at several external projects and monitoring vendors that claimed to offer PromQL-compatible APIs. Using an <a href="https://github.com/promlabs/promql-compliance-tester">open-source compliance checker tool</a>, we evaluated each implementation by running a set of test queries against both the native Prometheus server and the vendor implementation. As a result, we found multiple bugs in the tested projects, and mapped out in detail how each deviated from the upstream implementation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more vendors have entered the PromQL space, while existing projects have worked on improving their PromQL support as a result of our last blog post. Today, we are presenting an updated set of PromQL test results both for existing projects and a couple of new ones. We tested each of these implementations against the latest Prometheus version, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.23.0">v2.23.0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores"><a href="#before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores" aria-label="before we start a note on interpreting test scores permalink"></a>Before we start: a note on interpreting test scores</h3>
<p>When looking at individual test results, please note that the numeric scores alone paint a limited picture. They don't necessarily tell you how impactful implementation errors are, nor how many distinct behavioral differences there are. Since PromQL expressions naturally compose and build on top of each other, it is infeasible to isolate all possible query errors into fully independent test cases. Many of the test queries will contain the same constructs as other queries, in a nested way. For example: If an implementation selects data incorrectly, then this breaks not only a simple data selection test query, but also all other test query cases that try to run a function, operator, or other transformation based on selected data. The test cases also include a lot of variations of the same type of query, but with different ranges, quantile values, or other parameters. So if e.g. a function is broken in a general way, it may cause multiple test case variants to fail at the same time.</p>
<p>Another matter of more subtle interpretation are vendor extensions and extreme edge-case behavior. For example, a vendor may choose to not raise an error when executing a function with a parameter value that is illegal in native PromQL, but legal and sensical in the extended language. Or a vendor may return a different value for an unusual edge-case behavior, such as running <code>histogram_quantile()</code> with a quantile value larger than <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>We still provide the numeric test scores as a quick way to map out the vendor landscape and to motivate the ecosystem towards achieving a 100% score. But if you need to understand behavioral differences in more depth, please <a href="https://promlabs.com/promql-compliance-tests">take a look at the full test results</a> and read on for the details.</p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests"><a href="#criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests" aria-label="criteria for including a vendor in tests permalink"></a>Criteria for including a vendor in tests</h3>
<p>We are always on the lookout for new PromQL implementations to include in these tests. To include a project or vendor, we look for two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is either advertising full or partial PromQL compatibility of their system, and/or otherwise positioning their solution as a drop-in replacement for an existing PromQL implementation.</li>
<li>For practical purposes, we need to be able to ingest test data into the system and query it back via a PromQL-style HTTP API. Otherwise, we can't run any tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, some vendors failed the second criterium for now, so we couldn't include them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sysdig.com/">Sysdig</a> <a href="https://docs.sysdig.com/en/using-promql.html">advertises PromQL support</a>, but has no <code>remote_write</code> protocol support to ingest arbitrary test data. According to contacts at Sysdig, <code>remote_write</code> may be supported at some point in the future, but we couldn't get a recent update on its availability timeline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vmware.com/de/company/acquisitions/wavefront.html">Wavefront</a> <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_prometheus.html">advertises partial PromQL support</a>, but they lack an HTTP endpoint against which to run test queries. Their PromQL support is only available within their own user interface so far, which makes it difficult to test against. However, judging by the various compatibility caveats listed in their documentation, we do not expect that they would reach a high test score if we could test them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to be able to test even more vendors in the future.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After publishing, we received questions about PromQL support in two more vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> once <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/promql">started implementing PromQL support</a> (coincidentally with the help of the author of this blog post), but as far as we are aware, this effort has been paused and PromQL support in InfluxDB is neither currently available nor is it being advertised.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-metrics-7-7-0-released">advertised PromQL support in Elastic Metrics</a>. However, the announced feature is only about Elastic Metrics being able to run queries against an <em>existing</em> external PromQL endpoint (such as Prometheus) to then ingest the query result as metrics into Elasticsearch. There is no way to run PromQL on the resulting data stored in Elasticsearch itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set"><a href="#minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set" aria-label="minor updates to the test query set permalink"></a>Minor updates to the test query set</h3>
<p>Since the last testing round in August, we made minor changes to the test query set:</p>
<ul>
<li>For queries that looked at the absolute values of counter metrics (e.g. with no <code>rate()</code> or similar counter-related function applied), we changed the selected metrics to be gauges instead. This helps keep test cases somewhat more independent for a vendor like New Relic, which does not support storing or retrieving absolute values for counters.</li>
<li>We added a query selecting an intermittently present series to test whether <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness">staleness handling</a> works.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-get-started-updated-comparisons"><a href="#lets-get-started-updated-comparisons" aria-label="lets get started updated comparisons permalink"></a>Let's get started: Updated comparisons</h3>
<p>In this round of tests, we tested the following projects and vendors, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a> - An open-source, horizontally scalable reimplementation of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/">Grafana Cloud</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://m3db.io/">M3</a> - An open-source metrics engine and time series database.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metricfire.com/">MetricFire</a> - A hosted monitoing and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a> - An open-source project to provide query aggregation for long-term storage and HA on top of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timescale/promscale">Promscale</a> (<a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>) - An open-source project to store Prometheus data in TimescaleDB.</li>
<li><a href="https://victoriametrics.com/">VictoriaMetrics</a> - An open-source time-series database and monitoring system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the test results for each of these systems:</p>
<h4 id="chronosphere"><a href="#chronosphere" aria-label="chronosphere permalink"></a>Chronosphere</h4>
<p>Chronosphere does not have a self-service account creation system yet, but they helpfully provided us with a test account with <code>remote_write</code> and PromQL HTTP API support. Chronosphere is built on top of M3 (tested below), so we expected similar test results for the two. After an initial test run against an outdated test environment using an older M3 version, Chronosphere updated our test account and we achieved a test score of <strong>100%</strong> against it.</p>
<h4 id="cortex"><a href="#cortex" aria-label="cortex permalink"></a>Cortex</h4>
<p>Last time we tested Cortex we encountered two minor issues: floating-point input timestamps were <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/2932">not rounded in the same way</a> as in Prometheus, and the system did not <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/416">support executing queries without a metric name</a>. The first issue has been resolved entirely, while the second one is being addressed by a new storage mode in Cortex - the new <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/">blocks storage mode</a> vs. the older <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/chunks-storage/">chunks storage mode</a>.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/releases/tag/v1.5.0">version 1.5.0 of Cortex</a> and see what scores each of these modes received:</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-chunks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-chunks-storage" aria-label="cortex with chunks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with chunks storage</h6>
<p>When testing Cortex with the old chunks storage, we can now remove the query tweak to align input timestamps, since that bug has been fixed. Other than that, we still get the same test score of <strong>99.62%</strong> due to the chunks mode not supporting queries without metric names.</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-blocks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-blocks-storage" aria-label="cortex with blocks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with blocks storage</h6>
<p>Cortex with blocks storage mode now also does not require any query tweaks anymore and passes with a score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="grafana-cloud"><a href="#grafana-cloud" aria-label="grafana cloud permalink"></a>Grafana Cloud</h4>
<p>Grafana Cloud is a new test candidate that <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/metrics/prometheus/">advertises full hosted Prometheus functionality</a>. Under the hood, Grafana Cloud uses Cortex to offer this service. According to representatives from Grafana Labs, they are in the process of phasing out the last (shared) chunks-based Cortex cluster, while all new Cortex clusters are already using blocks as their storage mode.</p>
<p>To be able to cache PromQL queries, Grafana Cloud aligns incoming query start and end timestamps to the query resolution step width (10 seconds in our case). This is currently not configurable on the Grafana Cloud side, so we had to apply a cross-cutting query tweak to align input timestamps to our reference Prometheus server in the same way, to get comparable results.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we tested a Grafana Cloud account via <code>remote_write</code> and their Prometheus-style HTTP query API on both the remaining legacy cluster and a new dedicated blocks-storage cluster, and we got the same <strong>99.62%</strong> and <strong>100%</strong> test scores as for Cortex itself. Since the chunks-mode cluster is being retired this month, we count that as an overall <strong>100%</strong> score for Grafana Cloud.</p>
<h4 id="m3"><a href="#m3" aria-label="m3 permalink"></a>M3</h4>
<p>M3 is also a new candidate in this group that states, "M3 can be used as Prometheus Remote Storage and has 100% PromQL compatibility", <a href="https://m3db.io/">on its homepage</a>. Its documentation also mentions <a href="https://m3db.github.io/m3/integrations/prometheus/">Prometheus and PromQL integrations</a> that include <code>remote_write</code> support and a PromQL HTTP API endpoint. Using these with M3 version v1.0.0, we ran our test suite and received a test score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For PromQL to work 100% the same as in Prometheus, we had to ensure that our test query was only hitting raw, non-aggregated data in M3 (vs. data that has been downsampled into a lower resolution). We did this by not configuring any aggregation in our test M3 database.</p>
<h4 id="metricfire"><a href="#metricfire" aria-label="metricfire permalink"></a>MetricFire</h4>
<p>MetricFire, a hosted service by the people behind <a href="https://www.hostedgraphite.com/">hostedgraphite.com</a>, is still pretty new in the Prometheus space. While MetricFire documents how to write data into the system using the <code>remote_write</code> protocol, there is no officially supported way to run external PromQL queries against the collected data using an HTTP API yet. However, MetricFire representatives kindly explained a way to do this. We won't detail it here, but we expect that there will be a documented public HTTP API soon. In our talks with MetricFire we learned that they also use Cortex to back their service, and we also …</p></div></div>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase is free. All talks were streamed live and are now available on <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6aNlOgiyE4W30X7DpXx74m"><i></i>&nbsp;YouTube</a>.</strong>

<p>
No Starch Press is publishing a book based on this website in early 2021. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This book will <em>not</em> teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX <em>work</em>. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make <em>Toy Story</em> out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Graphics from scratch</strong> is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.</p>
<p>There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence <strong>“from scratch”</strong>. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.</p>
<p>This work is divided in two main parts, <strong>Raytracing</strong> and <strong>Rasterization</strong>, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The <strong>Common concepts</strong> chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, <em>sample code</em>, written in the most <em>clear</em> way possible, which may not be the most <em>efficient</em> way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png">
</figure>
<p>While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strengths:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png">
</figure>
<p>The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a <code>canvas</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="why-read-this">Why read this?</h2>
<p>This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Shaders</strong>. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding</strong>. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, <em>understanding</em> what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fun</strong>. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is <em>nothing</em> compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>
<p>This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture filtering</li>
<li>Normal mapping</li>
<li>Textures in the raytracer</li>
<li>Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)</li>
<li>Reflection in the rasterizer</li>
<li>Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters</li>
<li>Linear algebra appendix</li>
<li>Make demos interactive</li>
<li>Clean up demo code</li>

<p>I’m a senior software engineer at Google. In the past I’ve worked at <a href="http://improbable.io/">Improbable</a>, who have a good shot at building the Matrix, for real (or at the very least revolutionizing multiplayer game development), and at <a href="http://mysterystudio.com/">Mystery Studio</a>, a game development company I founded and ran for about a decade, and which released almost 20 games you probably never heard of.</p>
<p>I taught Computer Graphics for five years at university, where it was a semester-long third-year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that inspired this book.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://spotify.design/article/designing-data-science-tools-at-spotify | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://spotify.design/article/designing-data-science-tools-at-spotify">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Spotify operates at a massive scale: We have millions of listeners whose activities generate huge amounts of raw data. Raw data by itself is not that helpful though; we need to be able to process, manage, and distill it into insights that can inform new features or improvements to the experience. And to do that, we need usable, well-designed tools that ensure these insights can be easily understood.</p><div><p>Up until recently, the tools Spotify’s data scientists used every day were designed mostly by engineers. There was no one dedicated to looking at the problems data scientists were experiencing holistically. This meant that a lot of the time, the tools were strung together with inefficient hacky workarounds.</p><p>Throughout the past year, a design team was created to rethink the existing stack and weed out these bad practices.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m a product designer in the R&amp;D Community at Spotify, and I’ve been working in the data tools space for about a year — which makes me one of the longest-serving designers in the team. I was brought in to pair up with engineering squads working on platforms and experiences for data scientists. Most recently, I helped to create and launch a new data science tool that would expedite insights production, and eliminate those old, inefficient ways of working.</p><h3>Hierarchy of needs</h3><p>Before I get into the nitty-gritty of how we designed this new data science tool, it helps to understand how data scientists transform raw data into usable insights.&nbsp;</p><p>In her post for Hacker Noon, Monica Rogati explains <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><i>The AI Hierarchy of Needs</i></u></a>. This is the idea that<strong> </strong>there are many steps between getting data and using it for business.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs outlines the steps between getting data and using it for business. </p></div><div><p>First, they need to collect the right data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Then they need to process that data.&nbsp;</p><p>Only when it has been processed can it be analyzed and explored.&nbsp;</p><h3>Existing landscape</h3><p>When we started thinking about how to do this at Spotify, there were already some tools in use:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a Google data warehouse product with a web user interface where data scientists can store and process data. They can write queries here to make sure they have the right dataset for their question.</p><p><strong>Jupyter Notebooks&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Often simply called “notebooks.” Notebooks are an open source interactive workspace for running code in blocks mixed with prose.&nbsp;</p><p>After Data Scientists use the BigQuery UI to validate their dataset, they use local notebooks to find insights, create visualizations, which explain the findings, and share their work (among other tasks).</p><p><strong>ScienceBox&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is an internal Spotify command line interface tool to help speed up the way Data Scientists use notebooks. It’s commonly used as a way to organize files into projects, pre-install data science libraries, and create a standardized and reproducible data analysis workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>
These tools worked well for small datasets, but as data scientists were expected to work with bigger and bigger datasets, however, they had to wait longer to see the results of their code. If we expect data scientists at Spotify to find high-impact insights from the huge amounts of data we collect every day, they need tools to help create high-quality insights at high speeds.</p><h3>Our design challenge</h3><p>By the time I got involved in the project, the basic framework for the plan had already been established. ScienceBox was going to be rebuilt with a UI in the cloud, allowing us to unlock cloud computing benefits such as scalability, high-speed processing, and infrastructure flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>We hypothesized that improving this tool by adding processing power, scaling discoverability, and using cloud infrastructure, we could help data scientists analyze data more efficiently, improve collaboration, and reduce the time to find insights in data.</p><p>To start off, I caught up on all the research conducted so far, and mapped out the existing workflow so we could clearly see the changes we needed to make. With the help of a visual workflow, we saw that we could group the type of work into two main types — “ad hoc querying” (i.e. quickly querying data to find immediate answers), and “long-term investigations” (structured projects with month-long timelines).&nbsp;</p><p>I then segmented our users into targeted groups so we could make user-informed design decisions for the workflows we identified. Below is a sample flow for a data scientist running an ad hoc analysis.</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>A visual workflow showing various products a user had to interact with to complete a task</p></div><div><h3>What we learned&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>In rebuilding a crucial tool like ScienceBox in the cloud, we learned 3 important lessons along the way that informed our approach and ultimately led to a more effective tool. They were:</p><ol><li><p>Quick actions make life easier</p></li><li><p>Design for discoverability</p></li><li><p>Highly variable workflows are normal
</p></li></ol><p><strong>Quick actions make life easier</strong></p><p>When we started this project, we watched many data scientists use existing analysis tools to learn how these tools were used. We learned a lot about the limitations of these tools in the context of their work. For example, we learned that if data scientists were conducting analysis locally, it could take up all of their laptops' computational resources. This meant they couldn’t use their laptops for other tasks, and they often ended up running their queries overnight. It also meant that analysis running throughout the day could involve <i>a lot</i> of waiting.
</p><p>Our decision to create a cloud product would allow data scientists to add processing power by running code in the cloud, rather than on their laptops. They would use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>virtual machines (VMs)</u></a>, an emulation of a separate computer system, to speed up the time it takes to run code. These VMs range from standard size (standard speeds) to large size types (extra-high speed and memory). With these VM types, data scientists could free up their laptops for other tasks, run multiple jobs at once, and run each job faster.&nbsp;
</p><p>There was one catch: Our internal interface would mainly function as the launchpad into the web-based interactive development environment, JupyterLab notebooks (the next generation of notebooks), in a new browser tab.
</p><p>All the data analysis and processing work would take place in these notebooks, but since each one needed a virtual machine to power it, every data scientist had to use our separate internal tool at the start of each project to add those resources.&nbsp;
</p><p>Our challenge was to design a product that enabled data scientists to access notebooks as quickly as possible.</p><p>Initially, we thought that data scientists would choose a notebook project before deciding what size the VM powering that notebook should be (the bigger the virtual machine, the higher the speed and memory capacity).&nbsp;
</p><p>This reasoning meant that the VM controls were considered a secondary action, which we hid in a slide-out side panel. However, after user testing, the team and I learned that this hypothesis was incorrect. Controlling the VM was actually one of the main needs in the ScienceBox Cloud UI, so it needed to be front and center.</p><p>
To solve this, we iterated based on the user testing results and added a VM control as a "quick action" in line with the notebook project name.</p></div><div><p>This worked better than expected. As a workflow shortcut, it allowed users to immediately jump in and work without thinking about how to administer their VMs. Additionally, the status of the machine served as a quick way to sort active projects, so that users could visualize which projects they were working on.&nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Design for discoverability</strong></p><p>When we were researching, we learned that the many notebooks scattered across Spotify meant it was hard to locate past work.</p><p>
In our solution, since we believed that data scientists needed access to only their team’s work, we first decided to limit the search results by auto-populating every data scientist's account.</p><p>However, we quickly learned our initial assumption was incorrect. We found that Spotify data scientists often worked across teams and needed access to a wide variety of past work. The data owners they needed to talk to were often on different teams.&nbsp;
</p><p>We pivoted, focusing on increasing the discoverability of notebooks to improve collaboration.<strong> </strong>That meant displaying every findable notebook in our database, enabling users to search and discover notebooks created by others in addition to their own past work. Mapping different discovery flows became important. By visualizing workflows and user journeys, I helped the team understand what changes could have the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>A workflow showing how feature changes would affect the user experience</p></div><div><p><strong>Highly variable workflows are normal</strong></p><p>At first, we thought it would be simple to find a typical workflow among all our users. However, we learned that, while all data scientists want to get insights from data, there are many ways to reach that goal. Some run one-off queries to test hypotheses, others are embedded in month-long projects that require complicated analysis.&nbsp;
</p><p>Instead of forcing one flow on everyone, I designed an interface structure that was flexible enough to accommodate a dense amount of variable information, while highlighting a few primary actions.</p><p>We knew that the users were mainly visiting our platform to launch their notebook tool, so our quick actions had a large “Open” button that brought them directly to their coding environment. For notebooks without a VM, we made it easy for users to add one. For the layout, we created sortable columns and expandable drawers to empower the user to arrange the information to their liking.</p></div><div><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This is one of the most exciting products I’ve designed at Spotify. While it was challenging to create a product that served our many discovered use cases, it was also highly rewarding.</p><p>Firstly, ScienceBox Cloud has become highly successful. By having designers dedicated to creating a better experience for data scientists, we eliminated those old inefficient practices and allowed them to run their code up to 50% faster than before.&nbsp;
</p><p>Secondly, throughout the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>I think the title tells a lot about the story I’m going to tell you.</p>
<p>This is not a technical documentation for how I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD. This is a high-level for <em>why</em> I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I was using macOS as my daily driver. The main reason why I got a macbook was the underlying BSD Unix and the nice graphics it provides. Also, I have an iPhone. But they were also the same reasons for why I <strong>left</strong> macOS.</p>
<p>I did not want to write this post right after the migration, I wanted to take my time, use FreeBSD daily, see if I will ever miss macOS.</p>
<p>Here’s a tweet of mine from 8 months ago</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Every 4 months I look at my systems (servers, laptops, desktops, embedded) to see if there's anything suspicious, if anything got hacked, etc.</p><p>man, I did not realize that macOS is that complicated. Why is there a "studentd" running? I don't even use Classrooms :/</p></div>— Antranig Vartanian (@antranigv) <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1234753346600394752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>Let’s look at it this way. macOS is becoming less Unix-y every year, <code>date(1)</code> is outdated, there are 100+ Unix processes running by the time the system is booted, most of them are useless for the general user, it has no native package manager (at least MacPorts/homebrew/pkgsrc is out there) and for a power user, there is no proper documentation. Have you ever checked the FreeBSD handbook? Everything is right there!</p>
<p>Okay, the nice graphics part. Have you seen the latest and greatest Big Sur? It feels like eye-candy, it’s not made for power users at all, everything seems to be a distraction now, even the icons. I’m no UI guru, but bringing iOS to the desktop is not for everyone.</p>
<p>So I decided to move to FreeBSD. This is where many people will tell me “Okay but not everything works outside the box”, true! but which OS works outside the box these days anyway? Windows is still a nightmare, setting up macOS took me 3 days the last time, Linux takes way more if you’re building it from scratch. Setting up FreeBSD took me 3 days, however this meant that I will NOT need to change it again for a very, very, VERY long time.</p>
<p>Every time Apple pushed an updated, my <code>pf.conf</code> and <code>automount</code> configs got broken on macOS. They either got deleted or they moved somewhere. Well, the last 2 times it just got deleted.</p>
<p>On FreeBSD, I upgraded from <code>12.1-RELEASE</code> to <code>12.2-RELEASE</code> and nothing broke, and in case there were any changes, FreeBSD just asked me what to do about them.</p>
<p>Let’s come back for a second. Unix is outdated and Apple does not care about it, fancy graphics are too fancy now. Doing forensics is almost impossible. And the hardware is, well, not the best out there (have you ever disassembled a MacBook Pro? it’s takes 2 hours to change a battery while I can reassemble my Dell Latitudes and ThinkPads in 30 minutes).</p>
<p>So there was no reason to stay here anymore. I had to migrate. The question is: where?</p>
<p>Linux has systemd, not my favorite thing out there, Windows is privacy nightmare. That left me with 2 major options: Linuxes without systemd (Gentoo, in my case) or BSDs.</p>
<p>Since I run FreeBSD servers anyway, I just migrated to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Here’s a short review about running FreeBSD on ThinkPad T480s.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi: works. not the fastest, but fast enough.</li>
<li>Graphics: works.</li>
<li>Touchpad: works with multiple fingers AND very configurable via <code>sysctl</code>.</li>
<li>BT does discovery and pairs, I still have to try it with non-Apple headphones.</li>
<li>COVID-19 era: Zoom, Google Hangouts, Jitsi and all other WebRTC-based video conferencing software works via web as well.</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/linuxulator-how-to-run-google-chrome-linux-binary-on-freebsd.77559/">Linuxulator</a>, I can watch Netflix as well: <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1327422687107555329">here’s a screenshot</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, it’s Free and Open Source.</p>
<p>It’s been 1 month and 1 day since I last touched my MacBook Pro, so, what do I miss?</p>
<ul>
<li>Better BT support</li>
<li>Faster WiFi</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, that’s all missing on a FreeBSD laptop these days. WiFi can do 48Mbps according to <code>ifconfig</code> but I usually get 10-20Mbps. BT pairs with my Apple AirPods but I wish it worked till the end.</p>
<p>Having a nice workstation/laptop is not an easy thing, using macOS means living by Apple rules, Windows is the same for Microsoft. The BSDs gave me the power to be as free as possible :)</p>
<p>During the next weeks I’ll try to blog about the actual setup.</p>
<p>P.S. dear Apple employee, in case you’re reading this, please tell your management to update their BSD Unix layer. Some of us still care, some of us are not just Docker people, some of us are not just “modern” web developers. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! :)</p>

<p>When 7pace <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/7pace-for-github-announcement">decided to build a time tracking solution for the GitHub universe</a>, our developers thought it should be a somewhat straightforward project. Take the Timetracker we already built for Azure DevOps, and make it work for Github users. No sweat, right?</p>



<p>If you’re a developer, you probably already see where this is going.</p>



<p>Of course it wasn’t that simple.</p>



<p>“The team [working on the GitHub extension] came from that original team,” said 7pace product manager Sascha Zierfuss. “So although we know exactly what we’re doing, we understand how customers are using it and all that — the new product is in a different realm. So a lot of the assumptions and the knowledge that we had no longer applies.”</p>



<p>In other words, features that were simple to build for the <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/azure-devops-best-practices">Azure DevOps Timetracker</a> were a lot more complicated to build for the GitHub Timetracker. And that meant, as the team was making time and effort estimates for different parts of the work, they were off —&nbsp;sometimes <em>way</em> off.</p>



<p>“Now we take a bit more time to dive a bit more deeply and think about it a bit more before coming up with an answer as to how complex or how easy or difficult something is,” Zierfuss explained. “We take a bit more time upfront. But that has made our sprints a lot more successful and helped with the planning as well. If there’s something we think we can achieve in, say, a few months, we’re now better able to assess whether we need some help to reach that goal, if we have to cut a few things, and so on.”</p>



<p>As the developers who are nodding along already know, the 7pace team didn’t have a unique problem. Most, if not all, software teams struggle at some point with scoping work, especially when they’re working on something they’ve never done before. But how can your team accurately scope work when <em>every</em> project is something new?</p>



<p>We don’t have a perfect answer —&nbsp;whoever figures out how to solve this challenge will be a hero to the developer community. But we think some of the lessons our team learned about this can help other developers. We think there’s a secret weapon for scoping that many teams haven’t even considered.</p>



<h2>Step 1: Keep Calm and Code On</h2>



<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that this isn’t a world-ending problem. Yes, we should all be striving to get better at scoping work. But it’s a challenge that literally every software team faces. Don’t believe us? Well, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value#">one recent study</a> found that two out of every three enterprise software projects have cost and effort overruns.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="668" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1024x668.png" alt="66% of enterprise software products have cost and effort overruns" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1024x668.png 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-300x196.png 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-768x501.png 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1536x1003.png 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame.png 1590w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to scoping work, a little perspective can often be helpful. Keep in mind that estimates are a part of every step of the development process. We’re not giving you permission to give up on trying to be better at scoping, but we are saying: Don’t panic. Keep the work moving forward, even if it turns out your scoping is all wrong. And in the meantime, use these tips to get better at scoping your work.</p>



<h2>Project Scoping Best Practices</h2>



<p>When trying to scope a project, there are some best practices that can help all teams.</p>



<h3>Remember that Building Software Is an Evolving Process</h3>



<p>They call building software a “process of discovery” for a reason. As you move through any given project, you can <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/learning-is-work">expect it to evolve and change</a>. Requirements aren’t set in stone at the outset of a project, and as you progress through building the software, you may well find that you need to change the requirements along the way to better fit the spirit of what you’re trying to build.</p>



<p>This means that an important best practice is to stay in constant communication — with your team and with your client or organization. Keep every up-to-date on when and how project requirements are changing. This may mean making adjustments to your estimated scope as you go. But over time, your team should get better at making more accurate estimates.</p>



<h3>Mind Parkinson’s Law</h3>



<p>Parkinson’s Law says that work will expand to <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/healthier-work-systems">fill the time allotted for it</a>. That means that by giving yourself and your team deadlines based on your project scope, it’s just as important not to <em>overestimate</em> time and effort as it is not to <em>underestimate</em> them.</p>



<p>We get it. It’s easy to avoid missing deadlines by giving your team padded deadlines to allow for those unforeseen delays that every software team encounters. But this can just as easily result in taking much longer to deliver on a project than you actually need to, and thus getting in the habit of overestimating your scope.</p>



<p>Combat this by keeping sprints short. This means you get constant feedback on progress and new directions for the next sprint, which will help improve the quality of your time and effort estimates.</p>



<h3>Don’t Try to Transfer Estimates</h3>



<p>When scoping work, a very important thing to keep in mind is that time and effort estimates are not transferable between different members of your team. Developers vary wildly in their experience, expertise, work styles, and so many other factors that can affect how long it takes them to do a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll make better estimates about scope if you do so with everyone’s personal experience and skill level in mind —&nbsp;and even better if every dev on the team is invited to help scope their own work.</p>



<h3>Beware of Context Switching</h3>



<p>Part of the work that developers do is juggling multiple projects, clients, and responsibilities. It’s not often that a developer or a team will be solely dedicated to one project at all times.</p>



<p>While this keeps the job fun and interesting, it comes with a major downside: Frequent switching between tasks and projects can severely interrupt your team’s flow, which can slow down the work and lead to inaccurate scoping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is another area where doing short sprints can help. That way, your team has predetermined blocks of time for different tasks and projects, and can mentally prepare as needed.</p>



<h2>How to Scope a Project, Step by Step</h2>



<p>Most of these best practices require having <em>some</em> grasp of the time and effort it will take your team to complete a project. But what if you truly don’t know, because the project is something totally new to your team?</p>



<p>Use this framework for collecting information and turning it into a project scope that’s as accurate as possible, even when you’re navigating new territory.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1024x646.png" alt="How to Scope a Software Development Project" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1024x646.png 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-300x189.png 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-768x484.png 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1536x969.png 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project.png 1754w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Step 1: Collect All Crucial Information</h3>



<p>Before even beginning to estimate a project’s scope, you need to collect every piece of information about the project that might be relevant to the scope. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Project deliverables</li><li>All available resources, including team members, money, and work capacity</li><li>Inclusions and exclusions</li><li>Project constraints</li></ul>



<p>Gather as much detail about each of these as you can, as well as any other project information that might be relevant to the scope.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Build a Project Schedule</h3>



<p>Using all the relevant project information, you can start to sketch a rough schedule for completing the project. In your schedule, start with major tasks and milestones, and once those are laid out, try to break them down further into minor tasks and milestones. For especially long or complex projects, it might help to break up the work into phases, first.</p>



<h3>Step 3: Tailor the Scope to Fit Your Team</h3>



<p>Every team has <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/autonomy-software-teams">different work styles and methodologies</a>. Now’s the time to take your rough project schedule, and adapt it as needed to fit how your team works. This may mean breaking the first phase or milestone into your first sprints. It may mean assigning certain milestones to certain stakeholders to oversee. This will be different for every team.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Compile Your Scope and Review</h3>



<p>Now that you’ve gathered so much project information and turned it into a project scope, it’s time to review it —&nbsp;with other stakeholders, if necessary —&nbsp;and make any adjustments as needed. This is also the time to put the scope in writing and make sure it’s agreed upon by all the major stakeholders in the project. That way, you can refer back to your scope agreement throughout the duration of the work, and treat it as a guide for making changes or decisions. This can also help avoid scope creep, or any changes that will require time or money you don’t have.</p>



<p>The scope agreement may not be perfect, but having it in place can help negotiations go smoother if your estimates do turn out to be wrong, and you need to make scope adjustments as the project moves forward.</p>



<h2>For More Accurate Scoping, You Need Historical Data</h2>



<p>One great way for teams to find a starting point for scoping work (even on projects they’ve never tackled before) is by looking at historical data.</p>



<p>We know that time tracking isn’t the most popular thing among software teams (because <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/timekeeping-is-not-toxix">so many managers use it as a way to micromanage their developers’ time</a>). But we think time tracking can be so much more than that. We think it can be a powerful, if often overlooked, tool that software teams can use to make themselves better.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.7pace.com/timetracker">7pace Timetracker</a> is built by developers, for developers. It’s meant to be a timetracker that runs fully in the background so you don’t even notice it’s there. But all the while, it’s collecting data about the time you and your team spend working, and compiling that data so you can use it to identify your <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/software-development-pace-calculation">pace</a>, <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/what-causes-software-bugs">hurdles</a>, and successes — as an individual dev or as a team. The best part? You can use that data to help scope work —&nbsp;even when it’s work you’ve never done before.</p>



<p>We’re not saying this is a silver bullet. Accurately estimating work scopes, particularly on new types of projects, will probably always be a challenge for developers. But by using the right tools, teams can continue to improve their scoping skills.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Washington, D.C.</em> – The Libra Association announces the adoption of a new name and the recruitment of key executives, reinforcing its organizational independence. Now transitioning to the name “Diem”, which denotes a new day for the project, the Diem Association will continue to pursue a mission of building a safe, secure and compliant payment system that empowers people and businesses around the world.</p>
<p>The Association has been focused on ensuring that the project is designed to meet regulatory expectations, consistent with the Association’s guiding principles of innovation, inclusion, and integrity. “The Diem project will provide a simple platform for fintech innovation to thrive and enable consumers and businesses to conduct instantaneous, low-cost, highly secure transactions,” said Stuart Levey, the Diem Association’s CEO. “We are committed to doing so in a way that promotes financial inclusion – expanding access to those who need it most, and simultaneously protecting the integrity of the financial system by deterring and detecting illicit conduct. We are excited to introduce Diem – a new name that signals the project’s growing maturity and independence.”</p>
<p>As part of the effort to achieve regulatory approval and progress toward launch, Diem has recently attracted a group of world-class professionals to help lead the Association and Diem Networks, the subsidiary that is the regulated payment system operator. This includes the appointment of Dahlia Malkhi as the Association’s Chief Technology Officer, Christy Clark as Chief of Staff, Steve Bunnell as Chief Legal Officer, and Kiran Raj as Executive Vice President for Growth and Innovation and Deputy General Counsel.</p>
<p>Additionally, Diem Networks has recently announced the appointment of James Emmett as Managing Director, Sterling Daines, as Chief Compliance Officer, Ian Jenkins as Chief Financial and Risk Officer, and Saumya Bhavsar as General Counsel. “This is a stellar group of executives and having the Executive Committee of Diem Networks in place alongside existing leaders and colleagues is a critical step for Diem to operate with appropriate autonomy,” said Levey.</p>
<p>With the top team now in place, the Diem Association is prioritizing technological and operational readiness for launch. “The evolution of the project results from constructive ongoing engagement with governments, regulators and other key stakeholders,” said Levey. There is growing consensus around the world on the need to modernize financial infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to meet changing consumer demands and keep pace with global innovation in digital payments. The Association has committed that it will proceed only upon receiving regulatory approval, including a payment systems license for the operational subsidiary of the Association from FINMA. The licensing process is ongoing and the operational subsidiary of the Association is in active and productive dialogue with FINMA.</p>

  <p>For a startup employee, learning about your company’s initial public offering (IPO) is an exciting time. But it’s also overwhelming from a financial planning perspective. You have a variety of different equity grants, and you must decide what to do with each one. How many stock options should you exercise and sell, and when? What will your tax obligations be, and how can you minimize them?</p>
  <p>This guide covers what a startup employee needs to know to make well-informed decisions about all of this. We’ll start with tax considerations around exercising and selling stock. Then, we’ll discuss strategies and timelines for selling stock after the IPO. Finally, we’ll go over ways to further minimize your tax burden after selling.
  </p>
</section></div><h3>Taxes</h3><div><section>
<p>Money made from selling stock is taxed either as ordinary income (i.e. <span>federal<label for="sn-federal"></label></span><span>In 2020, the federal tax brackets

      income taxes), or as long-term capital gains. If you acquire a stock (e.g. by exercising an option or vesting an
      RSU) and hold it for over a year before selling it, then your profit is classified as a long-term capital gain.
      Profits from stocks held for less than a year are short-term capital gains, and they’re taxed at the same rate
      as
      ordinary income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long-term capital gains are taxed at about half the

        between $40k-$441,450; 20% for income exceeding $441,450. In California, though, you’ll have to <a href="https://pocketsense.com/capital-gains-taxes-state-california-8405869.html">pay</a> additional
        state income tax on all capital gains (see footnote 2).</span>
      . So, in general, to minimize your tax
      burden, maximize your long-term capital gains.

      Employee stock options represent the right to purchase a certain number of shares of your company at a certain
      price, once the options have vested. There are two types—ISOs and NSOs—and early-stage companies will typically
      issue a mix of both to their employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each tranche of options that you’ve been issued, be aware of three key numbers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your strike price (aka exercise price): how much you pay to purchase each share.</li>
      <li>The 409A value (aka fair market value) of the shares, as of the time you exercise the options. For private
        companies, the 409A value is an independent appraisal of how much the private company’s stock is worth. After
        the
        IPO, this value becomes
        <span>the company’s public stock price.<label for="sn-psp"></label></span>
        
        <span>Leading up to the IPO, the fair market value of your shares will likely rise greatly
          towards the company’s preferred price (or at least fluctuate). These fluctuations may greatly impact your tax
          calculations, and your company's finance team should keep you up-to-date on them.</span></li>
      <li>Your sale price: the price at which you later sell the shares.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On a high level, here is the difference between ISOs and NSOs:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For NSOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay ordinary income tax on (409A value - exercise price) when you exercise your options. So, if you pay $2 to
        purchase each share and the 409A value is $10, then you’re taxed on the $8 spread.</li>
      <li>Pay
        <span>capital gains tax<label for="sn-cgt"></label></span>
        
        <span>Depending whether you held the shares for over a year before selling them, you’ll either
          pay long-term capital gains or ordinary income tax on them.</span>
        on (sale price - 409A at the time of exercise) when you sell the shares. So, if you exercise the shares when the
        409A value is $10, then sell those shares for $50, then you’ll be taxed on the $40 capital gain.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>
      <b>For ISOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay no tax when you exercise—unless you trigger the AMT (details below)</li>
      <li>Pay long-term capital gains tax on (sale price - exercise price) when you sell—if the shares are sold at least
        one year after exercising, and at least two years after your options were granted. Otherwise, (sale price -
        exercise price) will be taxed as short-term capital gains (roughly ordinary income). </li>
    </ul>

<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you will likely qualify for the Alternative Minimum Tax, or
      <span>AMT.<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
      
      <span>Back in 1969, 155 individuals with incomes over $200,000 managed to pay zero federal income
        taxes, triggering popular outrage. The AMT was introduced to prevent this from happening again.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The AMT is calculated based on the bargain element: the (409A value - exercise price). You owe AMT if:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Your total bargain value ( [409A value - exercise price] * total ISOs exercised ) exceeds the AMT exemption
        amount (which
        was
        <span>$72,900 for unmarried individuals<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
        
        <span>For married couples filing jointly, the 2020 AMT exemption amount was $113,400.</span>
        in 2020).

      </li>
      <li>
        The tax you owe under the <span>AMT calculation<label for="sn-amtcalc"></label></span>
        
        <span>We won’t discuss how to calculate your exact AMT burden in this article, but it will come
          out to 26-28% of your total bargain value.

        </span>
        exceeds the tax you owe under regular tax calculations.
      </li>
    </ol>
  

    <p>
      You will have to pay AMT when you file your tax return for the year that you exercise your ISOs (it is not
      withheld at the time you exercise), so make sure to plan accordingly.
    </p>
</section></div><h4>AMT Credits<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you pay AMT . Then, when you
      sell those shares, you’re taxed again on your capital gains. To lessen the blow of thus being taxed twice on ISOs,
      Congress introduced AMT credits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you paid $5000 in AMT in 2019. In any subsequent year where you don't owe AMT (say, 2020), you might be
      able to get back some or all of that $5000. There are a few
      conditions for getting this tax credit:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>You can't owe AMT in 2020.</li>
      <li>The maximum amount of AMT credit you can claim for 2020 is [regular tax bill for 2020 - AMT amount for 2020].
        After you claim your credits for 2020, any of the original $5000 that's left over can be used toward a
        subsequent year's tax deduction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are many other caveats that may warrant speaking with a financial advisor. But the bottom line is: you may
      want to try to strategically maximize the amount of AMT credit that you can claim later. Or, you can limit the
      number of ISOs that you exercise and stay below the AMT exemption amount (thus avoiding the AMT altogether).
    </p>
</section></div><h4>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      RSUs turn into shares of your company’s stock when they vest. They’re typically issued by companies valued at over
      $1 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
      RSUs are subject to either single- or double-trigger vesting. Single-trigger RSUs can vest before IPO. This means
      you’ll owe taxes on them as they vest (because you’re coming into ownership of new shares of stock). However, if
      the company is still private, you won’t be able to sell those shares to make money to pay the taxes you owe on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s why many companies instead offer double-trigger RSUs, which only vest after the IPO. That way, you’ll only
      owe taxes once the company is public and you can actually sell those shares. So, for the year that your company
      IPOs, be prepared to pay taxes on
      <span>any double-trigger RSUs that you vest.<label for="sn-dtr"></label></span>
      
      <span>Your RSUs may vest either on IPO day or after the lockup period, depending on the
        company.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When your RSUs vest (whether before or after IPO), you’ll owe ordinary income tax on the
      <span>409A value of your newly issued shares as of that day.<label for="sn-4nid"></label></span>
      
      <span>As a reminder, the 409A value after IPO is equivalent to the company’s public stock
        price.</span>
      Then, when you sell those shares, your profit (i.e. [sale price - 409A value as of the day the shares vested])
      <span>will be taxed as capital gains.<label for="sn-wtcp"></label></span>
      
      <span>Again, these qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment if you hold onto the shares
        for over a year.</span>

      You can actually exempt your stock from all the federal taxes we’ve discussed above, if it counts as qualified
      small business stock (QSBS). Your stock might qualify as QSBS if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>At the time that your stock was issued (i.e. when you exercised your options), your company’s gross assets did
        not exceed $50 million.</li>
      <li>You’ve held the stock for at least five years before selling it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are a number of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qsbs-qualified-small-business-stock.asp"></a>other caveats. But, if
      you can get QSBS treatment, you’ll almost certainly save a lot of
      money in taxes.
    </p>
</section></div><h3>Selling your stock<br></h3><div><section>
<p>
      With these tax considerations in mind, let’s discuss plans for selling your shares.
    </p>
    <p>The soonest that you can sell your shares is after the lockup period. The lockup period lasts around six months,
      starting from the IPO date, and is meant to prevent employees from flooding the market with their shares
      <span>(and thus lowering the stock price).<label for="sn-lup"></label></span>
      
      <span>This is generally true for traditional IPOs. If your company is going public via a direct
        listing, there might not be a lockup period.</span>
      After the lockup period, employees generally employ one of a few selling strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell most of their equity immediately.</li>
      <li>Sell most of their shares as soon as they qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment.</li>
      <li>Plan to sell a constant number …</li></ul></section></div></div></div>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.

<h2><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h2>



<p>In the publication entitled “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR” (Eurosurveillance 25(8) 2020) the authors present a diagnostic workflow and RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV (now known as SARS-CoV-2), which they claim to be validated, as well as being a robust diagnostic methodology for use in public-health laboratory settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of all the consequences resulting from this very publication for societies worldwide, a group of independent researchers performed a point-by-point review of the aforesaid publication in which 1) all components of the presented test design were cross checked, 2) the RT-qPCR protocol-recommendations were assessed w.r.t. good laboratory practice, and 3) parameters examined against relevant scientific literature covering the field.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The published RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV and the manuscript suffer from numerous technical and scientific errors, including insufficient primer design, a problematic and insufficient RT-qPCR protocol, and the absence of an accurate test validation. Neither the presented test nor the manuscript itself fulfils the requirements for an acceptable scientific publication. Further, serious conflicts of interest of the authors are not mentioned. Finally, the very short timescale between submission and acceptance of the publication (24 hours) signifies that a systematic peer review process was either not performed here, or of problematic poor quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide compelling evidence of several scientific inadequacies, errors and flaws. </p><p>Considering the scientific and methodological blemishes presented here, we are confident that the editorial board of Eurosurveillance has no other choice but to retract the publication.</p></div>







<h2><strong>CONCISE REVIEW REPORT</strong></h2>



<div><p>This paper will show numerous serious flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper, the significance of which has led to worldwide misdiagnosis of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and associated with the disease COVID-19. We are confronted with stringent lockdowns which have destroyed many people’s lives and livelihoods, limited access to education and these imposed restrictions by governments around the world are a direct attack on people’s basic rights and their personal freedoms, resulting in collateral damage for entire economies on a global scale.</p><p><strong>There are ten fatal problems with the Corman-Drosten paper which we will outline and explain in greater detail in the following sections.</strong></p></div>



<p>The first and major issue is that the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020 named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of virus experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China [1], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof. According to Corman et al.:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.”</em> [1]</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The focus here should be placed upon the two stated aims: a) <em>development</em> and b) <em>deployment of a diagnostic test for use in public health laboratory settings</em>. These aims are not achievable without having any actual virus material available (e.g. for determining the infectious viral load). In any case, only a protocol with maximal accuracy can be the mandatory and primary goal in any scenario-outcome of this magnitude. Critical viral load determination is mandatory information, and it is in Christian Drosten’s group responsibility to perform these experiments and provide the crucial data.</p>



<div><p>Nevertheless these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid virus. This model was based on the assumption that the novel virus is very similar to SARS-CoV from 2003 as both are beta-coronaviruses.</p><p>The PCR test was therefore designed using the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV as a control material for the Sarbeco component; we know this from our personal email-communication with [2] one of the co-authors of the Corman-Drosten paper. This method to model SARS-CoV-2 was described in the Corman-Drosten paper as follows:</p></div>



<blockquote><p><em>“<strong>the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV</strong> <strong>screening and specific confirmation, designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.”</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p>The Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is an important biomolecular technology to rapidly detect rare RNA fragments, which are known in advance. In the first step, RNA molecules present in the sample are reverse transcribed to yield cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified in the polymerase chain reaction using a specific primer pair and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. The technology is highly sensitive and its detection limit is theoretically 1 molecule of cDNA. The specificity of the PCR is highly influenced by biomolecular design errors.</p>



<h3><strong>What is important when designing an RT-PCR Test and the quantitative RT-qPCR test described in the Corman-Drosten publication?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>1. The primers and probes:</strong></h5>



<p>a) the concentration of primers and probes must be of optimal range <br>(100-200 nM)<br>b) must be specific to the target-gene you want to amplify<br>c) must have an optimal percentage of GC content relative to the total nitrogenous bases (minimum 40%, maximum 60%)<br>d) for virus diagnostics at least 3 primer pairs must detect 3 viral genes (preferably as far apart as possible in the viral genome)</p>



<h5><strong>2. The temperature at which all reactions take place:</strong></h5>



<p>a) DNA melting temperature (&gt;92°)<br>b) DNA amplification temperature (TaqPol specific)<br>c) Tm; the annealing temperature (the temperature at which the primers and probes reach the target binding/detachment, not to exceed 2 ̊C per primer pair). Tm heavily depends on GC content of the primers</p>



<h5><strong>3. The number of amplification cycles (less than 35; preferably 25-30 cycles);</strong></h5>



<p>In case of virus detection, &gt;35 cycles only detects signals which do not correlate with infectious virus as determined by isolation in cell culture [reviewed in 2]; if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe &amp; the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, the probability that said result is a false positive is 97% [reviewed in 3]</p>



<h5><strong>4. Molecular biological validations; amplified PCR products must be validated either by running the products in a gel with a DNA ruler, or by direct DNA sequencing</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>5. Positive and negative controls should be specified to confirm/refute specific virus detection</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>6. There should be a Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) available</strong></h5>



<p>SOP unequivocally specifies the above parameters, so that all laboratories are able to set up the exact same test conditions. To have a validated universal SOP is essential, because it enables the comparison of data within and between countries.</p>



<h3><strong>MINOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<p>1. In Table 1 of the Corman-Drosten paper, different abbreviations are stated – “nM” is specified, “nm” isn’t. Further in regards to correct nomenclature, nm means “nanometer” therefore nm should read nM here.</p>



<p>2. It is the general consensus to write genetic sequences always in the 5’-3’ direction, including the reverse primers. It is highly unusual to do alignment with reverse complementary writing of the primer sequence as the authors did in figure 2 of the Corman-Drosten paper. Here, in addition, a wobble base is marked as “y” without description of the bases the Y stands for.</p>



<p>3. Two misleading pitfalls in the Corman-Drosten paper are that their Table 1 does not include Tm-values (annealing-temperature values), neither does it show GC-values (number of G and C in the sequences as %-value of total bases).</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I have written at lengths about certain aspects of topological data
analysis, but I have neglected to discuss one of its main applications,
i.e. the classification of graphs. In this post, I will therefore take
you on a quick tour of our ICML paper <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">A Persistent Weisfeiler–Lehman Procedure for Graph Classification</a>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we are given a graph with node label information. The
graph could, for instance, be a molecule, whose nodes are atoms such as
carbon or oxygen, and whose edges indicate chemical bonds. The goal
could now be to classify a given molecule into a set of classes, such as
‘toxic’, ‘carcinogen’, etc. How can we achieve such a classification?
One of the simplest techniques dates back to the 1960s and involves
calculating an <em>iterative fingerprint</em> of the graph! This procedure was
suggested by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Weisfeiler">Boris Weisfeiler</a>
and Andrei Lehman&nbsp;(sometimes also transliterated as ‘Leman’) in
their seminal article <a href="https://www.iti.zcu.cz/wl2018/pdf/wl_paper_translation.pdf">The reduction of a graph to canonical form and the
algebra which appears therein</a>.</p>
<p>At its core, the algorithm is an iteration scheme that works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a node $v$, collect its label and the labels of adjacent nodes in
a multiset.</li>
<li>Assign this multiset a new label by hashing it—with the proviso
that the hashing function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function"><em>perfect</em></a>, i.e.
it maps distinct labels to distinct values with no collisions.</li>
<li>Replace all node labels by their multiset hashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, each step of the algorithm accumulates more information
from nodes that are further removed from the current node. The hashed
multiset label is thus an expression of the neighbourhood around
a node—and after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the
hashed labels will not change any more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are dealing with this simple graph&nbsp;(to
prevent confusion of node labels and node IDs, I used <em>colours</em> to
indicate node labels in this example):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_graph.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman example graph" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Tabulating the neighbourhood of each node then results in the following
table:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_1.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (before hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Now for the hashing step. In this example, <em>perfect hashing</em> means
choosing a set of colours that is distinct for every distinct
combination of neighbourhood labels and vertex labels:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_2.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (after hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Notice how nodes A, B, and G are hashed to the same colour—because
in the first iteration of the algorithm, they cannot be distinguished.
How can we use the information about the hashed labels in a subsequent
comparison task? The answer is lies in <em>counting</em> them in a histogram
vector, which is indexed by the unique labels—this is where our
requirement of the perfect hashing function is helpful. For the
previously-shown graph, it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_feature_vector.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree feature vector" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>The <em>fingerprint</em> of this graph, according to the first iteration of the
Weisfeiler–Lehman scheme is therefore $(3, 1, 2, 1)$. Further iterations
just make the feature vector longer&nbsp;(technically, the initial
labels already give rise to a feature vector of counts). This procedure
can now be repeated for higher-order iterations and the resulting
feature vectors can be compared across graphs by evaluating, for
example, their dot product. More formalisations of this idea have
resulted in the very successful <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shervashidze11a/shervashidze11a.pdf">Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph
Kernels</a>
publication. This method arguably constitutes the basis for graph neural
networks—in fact, these networks can be seen as a parametrised
version of the Weisfeiler–Lehman iteration scheme. But I digress—if
you are interested in these aspects, please read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-weisfeiler-lehman-approximate-isomorphisms-and-metric-embeddings-f7b816b75751">Michael Bronstein’s
article on going beyond graph
isomorphism</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Now, despite its great practical utility, this feature vector is lacking
some <em>structural</em> information about the graph. It does not know whether
a certain label contributes much to the topological structure of
a graph—such as a ring of carbon atoms would in molecule—or not. To
this end, we introduced a notion of topological relevance for each node
label! Briefly put, we first developed a distance metric that would
permit us turn any <em>labelled</em> graph into a <em>weighted</em> graph. We then
calculate a persistence barcode, a topological descriptor of the graph.
This descriptor assesses the relevance of a topological feature created
by some node label. We use the topological relevance of each feature as
an additional <em>weight</em> for the previously-shown feature vector. In
essence, labels that contribute a large amount of topological structure
in a graph are assigned a higher weight than labels that only contribute
a meagre amount!</p>
<p>Here is a graphical depiction of our process:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/p_wl_pipeline.svg" alt="Persistent Weisfeiler--Lehman pipeline" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>If you want to brush up your understanding of the barcode calculation,
head on over to <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/">Christian’s website</a>; he has
an <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology">excellent article on persistent
homology</a>.</p>
<p>The neat thing about our approach is that we can easily integrate
information about <em>cycles</em> into the feature vector—this is
a functionality that the original Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph Kernels
Framework lacks. Moreover, these cycles turn out to be crucial in
improving classification performance—we get an increase of more than
3% in classification accuracy by considering them in some data sets!</p>
<p>If this has whet your appetite, I invite you to <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">read our
paper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/P-WL">take
a look at the code</a>. If you want
to learn more about graph classification using graph kernels, take
a look at our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">recent survey on graph kernels</a>,
which will hopefully be officially announced in time for NeurIPS 2020.
In the best tradition of Fermat, I would very much like to cover the
content of the survey here, but this blog is too small to contain all of
it—maybe for a subsequent post?</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

            If you want to order a book (or something else), don't buy it from
            Amazon.  Amazon harms its customers, as well as workers,
	    the national treasury, and many others that it affects.
	</p>

        <p>
            Here's a good (though long)
            <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/01/week-amazon-insider-feature-treatment-employees-work">
            overview of why Amazon's overall activity
            is harmful</a> to society overall.
        </p>

	<p>
	  This page lists
	  <a href="http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/boycotts/boycottamazon/amazonshoppingalternatives.aspx">alternatives
	  to Amazon</a> for buying various kinds of products.  Some of
	  these sites may share some of Amazon's unethical practices.
	  I am pretty sure that any site
	  <a href="https://stallman.org/internet-music.html">selling MP3 files</a> on the
	  internet imposes an EULA — an inexcusable wrong.
	  Streaming sites, too.  And all of them identify the
	  purchaser.  It is better to buy from a store, and pay cash.
	  Or else get a copy through sharing.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For a book, order it directly from the publisher or
          through a local book store.  If you want to use a URL to
          refer to a book, please don't use an Amazon page.
        </p>

	    Amazon is so <a href="https://ilsr.org/amazons_tollbooth/">close to being a monopoly for internet sales</a>
	    by most companies that it can gouge them.  It drives many of them into bankruptcy.
	    <p>
	      If you do internet purchases, making a point of not buying
	      through Amazon is a way you can personally push back.
	  </p></li>

<p>
If this isn't illegal, it ought to be.  We should not allow a store as big as Amazon to have anything to do with order fulfillment, for its own sales or anyone else's.
	  </p></li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Amazon has so much power over the US retail economy that it
	      <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xpgvx/amazons-is-trying-to-control-the-underlying-infrastructure-of-our-economy">
		imposes its
		power over all participants</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If it is going to be a monopoly, it should be regulated like other
	      monopolies.  Or perhaps more.
	    </p>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Amazon has

	      the market.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We should not allow a company to have a share over around
	      10% of any market.  If in a certain field a single dominant
	      company is beneficial for society, that means it is a
	      natural monopoly, and should be served by a regulated
	      utility.

		automatically</a> at the end of it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      This is clearly an attempt to trick customers — wrong in all cases 
	      no matter how many companies do it.

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Amazon's persistent blindness to certain fraudulent sales
	      schemes
	      makes it
	      <a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/08/11/fell-victim-1500-used-camera-lens-scam-amazon/">easy
		for fraudsters</a> to invalidate Amazon's guarantee to

            <p>

	      money, if they return too many defective products.

	    <p>
	      Amazon threatens to cut off customers if they return things more than
	      occasionally.  Amazon's customers nominally have the right to return
	      merchandise — <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zm8mde/amazon-banning-customers-for-returns">unless they exercise that right</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The strange irony of the article is that it is totally defeatist.  It
	      shows why we need to defeat Amazon, but assumes that that is
	      impossible.  It shows becoming dependent on Amazon is dangerous
	      and then refuses to believe people could ever refuse.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      You can't win by being defeatist.  You can win by telling Amazon to
	      drop dead.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I have never bought anything from Amazon.  And I never will.  Amazon
	      knows my name because a friend, believing this was helpful, decided to
	      get something for me and <em>told Amazon to send it to my address</em>, an
	      act which made me feel violated.  I hope nothing like that will ever
	      happen again.

That will enable them to listen to whoever the device's "owner" comes near.
	    <p>
	      But don't worry — Amazon is learning how to talk the talk about privacy in a way that more people would find comforting.
	    </p><p>
	      A voice command system that is safe for its owner would be one that runs only free software, and does the whole job locally, communicating with other sites only when asked to.  With the software inside free, the owner of this device would truly own it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606822927366/_cio4Ua4x.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We preferred to think that String in JavaScript is an array of characters.</p>
<pre><code>const <span>name</span> = ‘Nick’

console.log(<span>name</span>.length) // <span>4</span>
</code></pre><p>Variable <code>name</code> has 4 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’ and length is also 4.</p>
<p>Everything seems logical.</p>
<p>Let’s go further and add emoji to my name.</p>
<pre><code>const <span>name</span> = ‘Nick 🐃’

console.log(<span>name</span>.length) // <span>7</span>
</code></pre><p>Hmm, strange.</p>
<p>Variable <code>name</code> must have 6 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ ‘ (whitespace) and ‘🐃’</p>
<p>But have 7.</p>
<p>It seems like the bull has 2 characters.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> emoji = ‘🐃’

console.<span>log</span>(emoji.length) 
</code></pre><p>Interesting 🤔</p>
<p>Let’s figure out why.</p>
<p>We go to <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262">the official documentation</a> of ECMAScript (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">it’s a programming language on which JavaScript is based</a>).</p>
<p>Scroll to <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">“6.1.4 The String Type</a>.”</p>
<p>And find this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The String type is the set of all ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values (“elements”) up to a maximum length of 2⁵³ - 1 elements. The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the <strong>String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit value</strong>.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>❓What is UTF-16?</em></p>
<p><em>💬 A Unicode transformation format (UTF) is an algorithmic mapping from every Unicode code point to a unique byte sequence.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One UTF-16 code unit value is a number from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>❓What is 0x0000 and 0xFFFF?</em></p>
<p><em>💬  <strong>0x</strong> represent <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">the hexadecimal numeral system</a>, often shortened to "hex", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we convert my name Nick to UTF-16 (like JavaScript see it) we will get 0x004e 0x0069 0x0063 0x006b.</p>
<p>0x004e = N</p>
<p>0x0069 = i</p>
<p>0x0063 = c</p>
<p>0x006b = k</p>
<p>But how does JavaScript treat emojis?</p>
<p>In UTF-16, Unicode characters from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29">Basic Multilingual Plane</a> (contains characters for almost all modern languages) are encoded with one code unit. </p>
<p>Other characters from the non-Basic Multilingual Plane (emojis, musical notations, cards, hieroglyphs, etc) require two code units.</p>
<p>So UTF-16 format represents 🐃 emoji with two code units (0Xd83d 0Xdc03).</p>
<p>That’s why <code>‘🐃’.length</code> gives 2.</p>
<p>To consolidate everything we have learned, let’s play a little with Unicode and JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> name = ‘Nick’

<span>const</span> nameInUnicode = ‘\u<span>004</span>e\u<span>0069</span>\u<span>0063</span>\u<span>006</span>b’

<span>console</span>.log(name === nameInUnicode) // true

<span>console</span>.log(nameInUnicode.length) // <span>4</span>

<span>const</span> fullName = ‘Nick 🐃’

<span>const</span> fullNameInUnicode = ‘\u<span>004</span>e\u<span>0069</span>\u<span>0063</span>\u<span>006</span>b\u<span>0020</span>\ud<span>83</span>d\udc<span>03</span>’

<span>console</span>.log(fullName === fullNameInUnicode) // true

<span>console</span>.log(fullNameInUnicode.length) // <span>7</span>
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><em>❓ What is \u?</em></p>
<p><em>💬 A Unicode character escape sequence represents the single Unicode code point formed by the hexadecimal number following the “\u” or “\U” characters.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>Knowing that string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values can save you from unpredictable bugs when you work with different characters not from BMP, like emojis.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We propose a neural talking-head video synthesis model and demonstrate its application to video conferencing. Our model learns to synthesize a talking-head video using a source image containing the target person's appearance and a driving video that dictates the motion in the output. Our motion is encoded based on a novel keypoint representation, where the identity-specific and motion-related information is decomposed unsupervisedly. Extensive experimental validation shows that our model outperforms competing methods on benchmark datasets. Moreover, our compact keypoint representation enables a video conferencing system that achieves the same visual quality as the commercial H.264 standard while only using one-tenth of the bandwidth. Besides, we show our keypoint representation allows the user to rotate the head during synthesis, which is useful for simulating a face-to-face video conferencing experience.</p>

        <p>Link preview provided as a feature by webmail/clients such as Outlook or IM like Telegram may cause unexpected behavior like unwanted account register confirming, automatic mailing list subscribing or even infinite password resetting through links with special functionality.</p>
<h2 id="Official-Account-Used-For-Registering"><a href="#Official-Account-Used-For-Registering" title="Official Account Used For Registering"></a>Official Account Used For Registering</h2><p>One morning, I opened OUR mailbox, and found an address validation letter with a confirming link lying there. Spam, I thought, as this email address is used as a official account, no one in our organizaiton would use it for personal account registration, but right before I close this mailbox, I was suddenly reminded of something.</p>
<p>The day before this morning, we happily tested a new functionality provided by the webmail of Outlook – Link Preview. Well since we are already modern now, with modern front-end and modern webpage, what’s wrong with link preview? This is what we all expected! This is how modern front-end should be like!</p>
<p>But wait, would link preview visit every link in this email? If it does, right after I opened this email, the validation would be done!</p>
<p>Even worse, I cannot check whether the validation is over since the registered account is not in my hand and I dare not click on that confirming link.</p>
<p>After some discussion within our org, we think that there may be some allow lists that prevent the preview of certain sites, but if the list is not a list of REGEX, when I register the account of popular platforms, the link would still be previewed.</p>
<p>So the registered account still hangs there, we do not know its status, and bad thing can be done with that account.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Stories"><a href="#Other-Stories" title="Other Stories"></a>Other Stories</h2><p>After I discovered this issue, I come to a broader concern on similar issues. And after posting this issue among my friends, more stories are collected and more exploits can be done.</p>
<p>One story is that one user of Telegram <em>gmailbot</em> received a validation letter one day, and after they opened that bot, the message of confirmation success was received right away. The mechanism of preview of Telegram is to preview every first link of one message unless the user cancels that.</p>
<p>Another story is that one user of one email provider used that email for some account registering, and one day they forgot their password. For that site, password reset are done by a special link sent to the email address associated with that account, but for the sake of security, the email provider checks every link in the email(common behavior of big providers, maybe), hence the password reset link would have been accessed once when the user sees the email, and the reset cannot be done successfully. Since this security check is a black box and unrevealed to that user, the user tried almost infinitely and asked the admin of that site to debug.</p>
<ol>
<li>When subscribing a mailing list on web, a confirmation letter would be sent, in some forms it asks you to reply to that email containing certain string, but mostly it shows you a validation link. This may be used for spamming hence DoS of one account; it can also be used for DoS of one mailing list as all subscribers are ‘valid’.</li>
<li>When you upload a PGP public key to a keyserver like OpenPGP, it sends validation letter. Hence fake public key of one identity can be made with confirmation, and without revocation.</li>
<li>As the last story above indicates, password reset can never be done, or done by the provider.</li>
<li>When there are one-time special functional links(common behavior), and the provider/client automatically access that link in any form, there are unexpected behaviors. </li>
</ol>

<p>It talks about information leaking and malicious payload, while I am from the perspective of the protocol itself.</p>
<p>Providers, don’t touch my thing.</p>
<p>Automation/Rules without turn-off options are bad. </p>

<div><p>from the book “<a href="https://sive.rs/a" rel="tag">Anything You Want</a>”:</p></div>

<small>2008-10-23</small>
</header>

<p>
	I used to take voice lessons from a great teacher named <a href="http://www.warrensenders.com/">Warren Senders</a>.
</p><p>
	For each lesson, I’d bring in one song I was trying to improve.
</p><p>
	First, I’d sing it for him as written.
</p><p>
	Then he’d say, “OK — <strong>now do it up an octave</strong>.”
</p><p>
	“Uh... up an octave? But I can’t sing that high!”
</p><p>
	“I don’t care! Do it anyway! Go! 1.. 2.. 3.. 4..”
</p><p>
	I’d sing the whole song again, in screeching squeaking falsetto, sounding like a choking mouse.
	But by the second half of the song, it was almost charming.
</p><p>
	Then he’d say, “OK — <strong>now do it down an octave</strong>.”
</p><p>
	“Down an octave?  But I don’t think I can!”
</p><p>
	“Doesn’t matter! Go! 1.. 2.. 3.. 4..”
</p><p>
	I sounded like a garbage disposal or lawn mower, but he made me sing the whole song that way.
</p><p>
	Then he’d make me sing it twice as fast.
	Then twice as slow.
	Then like Bob Dylan.
	Then like Tom Waits.
	Then he’d tell me to sing it like it’s 4 a.m. and a friend woke me up.
	Then he’d give me many other scenarios.
</p><p>
	After all of this, he’d say, “Now… how did that song go again?”
</p><p>
	It was the clearest proof that what I thought was “the” way the song went was really just one of an infinite number of options.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	I’m taking an entrepreneurship class now.
	I’ve never studied business before.
</p><p>
	We analyzed a business plan for a mail-order pantyhose company.
	Like all business plans, it proposed only one plan.
</p><p>
	After reading the whole thing, I felt like saying things my old voice teacher would have said:
</p><ul>
<li>
	“OK — <strong>make a plan that only requires $1000.</strong> Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>make a plan for 10-times as many customers</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>do it without a website</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>make all your initial assumptions wrong, and have it work anyway</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>show how you would franchise it</strong>. Go!”
</li></ul>
<p>
	You can’t pretend there’s only one way to do it.
	Your first idea is just one of many options.
	No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.
</p><p>
	Realizing <strong>the initial choice you made was just one of many</strong> brings all kinds of weathered wisdom and insight into your business.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	Same thing with your current path in life:
</p>
<ul><li>
	Now you’re living in New York City, obsessed with success. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re a free spirit, backpacking around Thailand. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re a confident extrovert and everyone loves you. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re married and your kids are your life. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you spend a few years in relative seclusion, reading and walking. Go!
</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605889737391/MgHemT-bu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>A web application often needs a central counter. We have several simple use-cases like the member id for a registration application. Or the amount collected on a sales application - there are many that we all have seen. We have to make sure the concurrent updates do not clash, and the no data is lost in the process. This problem increases further when our application scales larger on the cloud - with millions of concurrent users.</p>
<p>It is best to avoid such a use case - in large scale applications. It is always advisable that we use a design that does not need an atomic counter - for example using UUID instead of an increasing number. But there are times where we just need the counter. When I found myself in such a situation, here is a solution that I used. It is based on API Gateway - Dynamo DB integration. It has a very good response time and minimal cost.</p>

<p>We all know what is DynamoDB. For those who don't, it is the wonderful serverless NoSQL database provided by AWS. It scales seamlessly to huge volumes and throughput - maintaining extremely fast operations with latency in single digit milliseconds. It is the ideal database for anyone - startup, or enterprise. DynamoDB ensures eventual consistency for all updates. But there is a way to get atomic updates as well.</p>
<p>Going by the One App - One Table philosophy, create a new Item in the table. You can choose the "primaryKey" field as per your data design.</p>
<pre><code>{
   <span>primaryKey</span>: <span>"atomicCounter"</span>,
   <span>counterValue</span>: <span>0</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>So we have a counter that starts with 0. Now, we to configure it to increment atomically and return the number. DynamoDB API provides a method to do it. In order to invoke it, we have to configure the API Gateway</p>

<p>The API Gateway is a versatile service to configure and export API's to the external world. We can use it to invoke Lambda functions, or directly invoke specific AWS Services. We will use the latter to invoke DynamoDB directly.</p>
<p>So we go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.thewiz.net/!https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/">API Gateway Console</a>, to create a new Rest API - or just a new Resource/Method in your existing application API. Create a new API, and resource and then add a GET method into it. We can use a POST as well. But, GET is more elegant since we only get the counter without providing anything.</p>
<p>Next, we configure the API integration to invoke the DynamoDB.</p>
<h2 id="request-integration">Request Integration</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605884426659/6UiP0SiQ2.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Request Integration.jpg"></p>
<p>Next we provide an integration mapping for the request. We do it here - at the bottom of the Request Integration page.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605880023900/7-otb2WgI.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Request Mapping.jpg"></p>
<pre><code>UpdateItem
{
    <span>"TableName"</span>: <span>"donation-data"</span>,
    <span>"Key"</span>: {
        <span>"context"</span>: {
            <span>"S"</span>: <span>"atomicCounter"</span>
        },
        <span>"id"</span>: {
            <span>"S"</span>: <span>"id"</span>
        }
    },
    <span>"UpdateExpression"</span>: <span>"set counterValue = counterValue + :num"</span>,
    <span>"ExpressionAttributeValues"</span>: {
        <span>":num"</span>: {<span>"N"</span>: <span>"1"</span>}
    },
    <span>"ReturnValues"</span> : <span>"UPDATED_OLD"</span>
}
</code></pre><h2 id="response-integration">Response Integration</h2>
<p>Similarly, we have to map the output on the response. Click on the Response Integration link and add this mapping in there</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605883483314/cStHWxsx7.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Response Integration"></p>
<pre><code>


$value.substring(<span>1</span>,$l)
</code></pre>
<p>We are done with configuring the API. Now click on Deploy API, select a stage and it is ready to test.</p>
<p>Invoke the API from Postman. Everytime you invoke it, you will see the number increasing. </p>
<p>The update operation we used is atomic, so we will always have a unique number from the API.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This white paper gives an overview of NTS and a detailed description of the authentication process that ensures you receive time information from a trusted source. This includes the step-by-step details of the key establishment and time stamping process. We also provide a summary of the elements that enable NTS to scale and to secure NTP against a range of attack vectors.</p><div><h2>This is a preview of Netnod's NTS white paper. To read&nbsp;the full white paper, see link below.
</h2><p>Introduction
</p><p>Many of the important security tools that keep us safe online depend on accurate time. But until recently there was no way to ensure that the time you received over the Internet was correct. There was simply no way to tell if you were being fed time from a malicious or trusted source.</p>
<p>This is largely because the current standard for receiving time over the Internet, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), was created in 1985. In those more innocent times, the need to secure NTP, the type of security needed, and how to provide it were less understood.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, a range of security flaws and some high-profile attacks have shown that NTP needed significantly improved security. The new Network Time Security (NTS) standard has been designed to fix that.</p>
<p><span><strong>NTP security issues&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Unsecured NTP is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where a malicious actor sits between you and the NTP server, listens in on the conversation, forges&nbsp; messages and lies to you about time. As a lot of processes are dependent on accurate time, the consequences here can be very serious and can include:</p>
<ul><li>Incorrect timestamps on logs and transactions which can support fraudulent activities or help disguise other criminal action&nbsp;</li>
<li>Authentication problems, attacks and issues with authentication security measures&nbsp;</li>
<li>Issues with cryptographic signatures and establishing encrypted sessions such as Transport Layer Security (TLS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>DNS Security (DNSSEC) failing to work if the client doesn’t have accurate time</li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Previous attempts at NTP security&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>There have been some previous attempts to add security to NTP. Commonly referred to as NTP-AUTH, these attempts did not provide all necessary aspects of security (confidentiality, authentication and integrity including protection against replay attacks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the underlying security mechanism for NTP-AUTH (MD5 or SHA-1) could be considered weak at best. NTP-AUTH is based on secret keys but the key agreement is not standardized. This means that any NTP service provider wanting to use NTP-AUTH has to find their own way to exchange keys with the client out-of-band.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This often requires a potential client to send a letter or fax to get the secret key. The need for a server to store uniquesecret keys for all clients creates scalability problems: as the number of users grows, the storage requirements and especially the ability to rapidly look up a given key makes the service hard to scale.</p>
<p>Given all these issues, it has long been apparent that a new security mechanism for NTP is needed; one based on modern security mechanisms that could also allow the service to scale to potentially millions of clients.</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS standard</strong></h2>
<p>NTS has been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In March 2015, the first Internet-Draft of the NTS standard was published. Over the next five years, the draft went through 28 further iterations until the Internet Draft ‘Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol’ was published as a Proposed Standard (RFC8915) in September 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses modern cryptography to add an important layer of security to NTP. It prevents spoofing and MITM attacks by using authenticated packets. Amplification attacks are prevented by ensuring that request and response packets are always the same size.</p>
<p>NTS is really two protocols: a key establishment protocol, and NTP with some new Extension Fields. The reason for using two protocols is separation of concerns:</p>
<p>1. The seldom used key establishment on top of standard Transport Layer Security (TLS), and</p>
<p>2. The (already existing) low latency UDP-based time synchronisation path.</p>
<p>This means that the existing NTP functionality is the same as before, but the time data can now be authenticated.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS authentication process</strong></h2>
<p>The authentication process consists of a key establishment and a timestamp request. The key exchange server typically runs on an ordinary computer, but the slim NTS-enabled NTP server is UDP-based and stateless. It can be served from anycast addresses and can be implemented at the hardware level. The NTP server’s state about each client is kept in the cookie provided by the client itself with each request. As there can potentially be hundreds of millions of clients, this is crucial for the smooth operation of a large-scale NTS service.</p>
<p>Since the cryptographic operations in the NTS path are symmetric it is both easier to implement them in hardware and to make them use constant time. This increases the accuracy of the time synchronisation and keeps the slower key exchange outside of the time synchronisation path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses Authenticated Encryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), more specifically what is known as Synthetic Initialization Vector (RFC 5297). This is a block cipher mode of operation providing nonce-based,&nbsp;misuse-resistant authenticated encryption. Using AES-SIV enables the encryption processes described below to add integrity and origin authentication. The consequences for this at a hardware level will be discussed in an upcoming&nbsp;white paper.</p>
<p><span><strong>The key establishment</strong></span></p>
<p>The key establishment process works as follows: first, a client initiates a key establishment using the NTS-KE protocol embedded in TLS (see figure 1.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Do you know addition?</em></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Of course! I learned mathematics when I was seven, addition is fairly easy!</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Do you really know addition? Please solve this equation</em></p>
<pre><code>true + [] = ?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Eh?</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Welcome to JavaScript addition!</em></p>
</section><article><section><p>If you have been working with JavaScript, you have probably seen a lot of usage with the <code>+</code> operator and discovered that the output is not necessarily what you expected.</p>
<p>The language supports using the <code>+</code> operator between (almost) all of the different data types - the results might therefore be confusing. In JavaScript, there is no compiler to hold your hand on your “addition journey”.</p>
<p><strong><em>The addition operator either performs string concatenation or numeric addition.</em></strong></p>
<p>With the rule above you should be able to understand all additions in JavaScript, but some of us need to see examples and explanations to fully understand the different scenarios.</p>
<p>First of all, remember that JavaScript performs the addition from left to right - evaluating parentheses first. This should be familiar with what you have learned in middle-grade mathematics.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>Step<span>-</span>by<span>-</span>step example
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>10</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As the rule states - with two numeric elements, the output is a numeric value:</p>
<p><code>1 + 1 = 2</code></p>
<p>String concatenation is well known between different programming languages and is a  reasonable usage of the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
<p><code>"Santa" + " " + "Claus" = "Santa Claus"</code></p>
<p>So far, so good!</p>
<h2>The most important “rules” with <em>addition</em> in JavaScript</h2>
<ol>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to a numeric value will try to convert the non-numeric value to a numeric value, if possible. If not, both are converted to strings.</li>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to some value will convert both values to strings before adding them.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what does that actually mean?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"112"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Confused? At least I am…</p>
<p>In the first line, a numeric and non-numeric value is added. Both are converted to strings before they are added</p>
<p><code>"1" + "2" = "12"</code></p>
<p>In the second line, there are both numeric addition and string concatenation. Remember, addition goes from left to right. </p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The third line only contains string concatenation.</p>
<p><code>"1" + "1" + "2" =&gt; "112"</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t end here. Some other data types in JavaScript behave in a rather non-typical way when used for addition.</p>
<h2>Boolean</h2>
<p>What happens when you add something with a boolean value?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>true</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>false</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1true"</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1false"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Boolean values can be converted to numeric values in JavaScript, and the result of the conversion is either 1 or 0.</p>

<p>Combining a boolean and a string value converts <code>true</code> to “true” and <code>false</code> to “false”.</p>
<h2>Objects, arrays and functions</h2>
<p>When one of the values in an addition is an object, array or function it will try to convert it to a primitive value.</p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the <code>valueOf()</code>-function and use that value if it is a primitive</li>
<li>Execute the <code>toString()</code>-function</li>
</ol>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"[object Object]1"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The default <code>valueOf()</code>-implementation is an empty object <code>{}</code> - which is not a primitive and it will try to convert it using <code>toString()</code>. The default <code>toString()</code>-value for an object is <code>"[object Object]"</code> - not very useful for addition. Unfortunately, I have seen this output many times during my time as a developer - it usually happens when I forget to specify the property of the object that should be part of the addition.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it might be handy to override the <code>valueOf()</code> or <code>toString()</code>-function and make it return something useful.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>valueOf</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>35</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The return type is now a numeric value and it will add 34 with 1 - which is 35.</p>
<p>The same can be done for a function or a class - for both <code>valueOf</code> and <code>toString</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>name <span>=</span> name<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>new</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> <span>34</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Charlie is 34 years old100"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For arrays, <code>valueOf</code> returns the array - which is not a primitive value. The output of its <code>toString()</code> is the content joined with a comma. An empty array is the same as an empty string.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1"</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,3"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3,4,5"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,34,5,6"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since you have been reading all along - here is a quiz for you:</p>
<p>PS: try to solve it before you check the browser console</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>

<span>true</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>65</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>"merry christmas"</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Date</h2>
<p>All rules have some exceptions...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All native ECMAScript objects except Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint Number were given; Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint String were given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Date.valueOf</code> returns a numeric type, but a date will be transformed into a string type when using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>12345</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"12345"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>

<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>valueOf</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1606777200000</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Weirdos</h2>
<p>Now that you know the important rules of addition, there are some data types you also should be aware of:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span> 
<span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"undefined1"</span>
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"null1"</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NaN1"</span>
<span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you have read, addition is not as easy as we know from mathematics. However, if you remember some of the conversion rules above you might save yourself from some headaches in the future!</p></section></article></div>]]>

December 1, 2020 | https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

          <section>
            <article>
              <header>
                                
                
              </header>
              <p>Logs are a handy tool to spot mistakes and debug code. For engineers and, specifically, in a DevOps environment, the logs are a very valuable tool.</p>
<p>In addition to the functional aspect of logging, logs are also critical from a Java security perspective. When a security breach occurs, your log files are the first place to look for clues about what happened. But with a large number of different frameworks available for logging in Java applications, how do you pick the right one? More importantly, how to do Java logging right?</p>
<p>The quality of the logs is critical. Logging both too much or too little information can be catastrophic from a Java security perspective. In fact, Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring (A10:2017) has made the OWASP Top 10 list.</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to guide you through a pragmatic approach to Java logging—what should we log, what shouldn’t we log, and how to implement Java logging properly.</p>
<h3>What Should We Log?</h3>
<p>Back in the military, whenever we had to report something, we had to use the 5W-H method—Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. This method is an excellent rule for logging statements as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who was doing this?</strong> Identify the user or system that made this request. If possible, with a userID and an IP address.</li>
<li><strong>What is going on?</strong> What kind of logging statement was this. Many developers already recognize the different log-levels to annotate the importance of a message (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE). It is wise to distinguish between functional logging, security logging, and maybe even audit logging if that is applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Where did it happen?</strong> Identify the location. You usually define a logger per class, so that is already a good start. However, we also need to know the specific method. Also, we want to know the particular node, if you are working with a microservice architecture, for instance.</li>
<li><strong>When did it occur? </strong>Time is essential, so make sure you log a timestamp. Be aware of timezone differences and, more importantly, change timezones twice a year. My advice is to always output in UTC, so it is clear to everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Why did it happen? </strong>The “why” is generally what you need to find out. You can’t always capture this in a single logline. In some cases, it is obvious. If so, make it part of the message. On many occasions, we can only explain the “why” once we see the relation between logs. Therefore make sure that your log messages are absolutely clear.</li>
<li><strong>How did it happen? </strong>Like the “why,” the “how” typically can’t be caught in one statement. Therefore, to correlate between message, especially in a service-based architecture, is extremely important. To achieve this, you should create a unique correlation ID for each incoming request in every service with an outbound interface. Once you have this ID, you should log it in every statement. If you need to transport this ID to another service, you can use the specific HTTP header X-Correlation-ID in order to correlate and be stateless.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging Security Events</h3>
<p>Java is mostly used in backend processes and will directly interact with the data. Therefore, we must keep track of security-related events. We have to prioritize these security events accordingly and consider events that need high privileges (admin events) even more critical.</p>
<p>In general, you can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>login success and failures</li>
<li>logouts</li>
<li>password changes and resets</li>
<li>creation and removal of users</li>
<li>authorization failures</li>
<li>access level changes</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should also log indicators that can point to specific attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>input validation errors: recognize script tags that lead to XSS attacks, or parameters like UNION that indicate a SQL-injection</li>
<li>HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses</li>
<li>getting insane amounts of requests by a specific IP</li>
<li>check IP ranges, for instance, if an internal service gets hit by an external IP-address</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a great tactic to set thresholds for certain security log events. You can actively send alerts when these thresholds are crossed. This way, you can - interfere accordingly and prevent more extensive damage.</p>
<h3>What Should We Not Log?</h3>
<p>Logging too much information is just as harmful as logging too little. You do not want your logs to be flooded by information that is not useful in production. Therefore, aim to always set the log level on a production system to a suitable level, like WARN or ERROR.</p>
<p>As part of development, engineers will log sensitive entities that might contain personal data, in order to debug applications. Although we should aim to prevent this, internal debug messages should have the proper log level—for example, DEBUG or TRACE—and should not be visible in the production environment.</p>
<p>As a general rule, an application should not reveal any application-specific or user-specific data—this data can be used by an attacker. Also, by exposing personal information, you are most probably not compliant with privacy regulations. Even if logs are only accessible to insiders, it is a single point of failure. So, we simply don’t want this information to fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>When developing, think about what you need to log. Do we need to log an internal ID, the unencrypted password, or someone’s credit card details? Be careful not to output a complete data object in Java as the output depends on the <code>toString()</code> method of that particular object.</p>
<p>By logging personal information for debugging, we circumvent many of our own security policies—it would be sensible not to log these types of information altogether. If we need to log specific data, make sure to set the proper log-level, such as DEBUG. You should also set the log-level of the production system to a higher level, like WARN.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line—personal and sensitive information must not appear in your production logging.</strong></p>
<h3>Security Logging in Java</h3>
<p>First and foremost, use a logging framework in Java. This seems like an open door, but in a ton of applications, people still use the old System.out.println() to write directly to the console. This should be prevented at all costs. A good linter (Spotbugs, PMD, SonarLint) could help you with this.</p>
<p>There are many different logging frameworks in Java. This article will focus on Logback and Log4j2, as these are currently the most used frameworks. However, regardless of the framework, it is wise to separate security logging from general application logging. In both Logback and Log4j2, you can easily do this by adding markers to the logger. With a specific marker, like SECURITY or maybe even AUDIT, you can easily filter these out in your logs. You could also add an extra appender to your logger and filter on the specific marker to store or display these logs separately.</p>
<h4>Logback</h4>
<p>To implement Logback, you only need the <code>logback-classic</code> dependency, as shown below. This will pull in both <code>logback-core</code> and the <code>slf4j-api</code> packages.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;logback-classic&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;1.2.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Markers</span></h5>
<p>Markers can be set with any given String and added to your logger regardless of the log level, as you see below.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogbackExample.class);
private static final Marker security = MarkerFactory.getMarker("SECURITY");

public boolean  login(String userName, String encryptedPassword) {
   logger.warn(security, "login attempt by user: {}", userName);
  ...
}</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Configuration</span></h5>
<p>In the following example of Logback configuration, I have created two appenders to my <code>logback.xml</code> file.</p>
<p>The first appender will show all the log lines in the console, including the marker I might have added. The second appender only filters out the security-specific logs based on the maker SECURITY and put these in a separate security log file per day.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;configuration&gt;
   &lt;appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender"&gt;
       &lt;encoder&gt;
           &lt;pattern&gt;%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-8marker %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
       &lt;/encoder&gt;
   &lt;/appender&gt;
   &lt;timestamp key="byDay" datePattern="yyyyMMdd"/&gt;
   &lt;appender name="SECURITY-FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender"&gt;
       &lt;filter class="ch.qos.logback.core.filter.EvaluatorFilter"&gt;
           &lt;evaluator class="ch.qos.logback.classic.boolex.OnMarkerEvaluator"&gt;
               &lt;marker&gt;SECURITY&lt;/marker&gt;
           &lt;/evaluator&gt;
           &lt;OnMatch&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/OnMatch&gt;
           &lt;OnMismatch&gt;DENY&lt;/OnMismatch&gt;
       &lt;/filter&gt;
       &lt;file&gt; security-${byDay}.log&lt;/file&gt;
       &lt;append&gt;true&lt;/append&gt;
       &lt;encoder&gt;
           &lt;pattern&gt;%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-8marker %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
       &lt;/encoder&gt;
   &lt;/appender&gt;
   &lt;root level="warn"&gt;
       &lt;appender-ref ref="STDOUT" /&gt;
       &lt;appender-ref ref="SECURITY-FILE" /&gt;
   &lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h4>Log4j2</h4>
<p>To use, you have to include the <code>log4j-api</code> and the <code>log4j-core</code> package, as seen below.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;2.13.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;2.13.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Markers</span></h5>
<p>Creating and adding the markers is similar to the Logback example; only this time, we use the specific Log4j manager to create the logger and the marker.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(Log4j2Example.class);
private static final Marker security = MarkerManager.getMarker("SECURITY");

public boolean login(String userName, String encryptedPassword) {
   logger.warn(security, "login attempt by user: {}", userName);
  ...
}</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Configuration</span></h5>
<p>Similar to the Logback configuration, I created a configuration for Log4j2 with two appenders where the security log will get stored in a separate file based on the markers. This configuration needs to be in the <code>log4j2.xml</code> on the classpath.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Configuration&gt;
   &lt;Appenders&gt;
       &lt;Console …</code></code></pre></article></section></section></div>

    <p>As technology advances, we are distracted by more things than ever, and it is getting harder to draw a strict line between work and free time. There are several time management techniques offering help to make ourselves more effective while working. One of the most acknowledged among them is the Pomodoro technique. The best approach is to download a Pomodoro timer app, so we help you below to navigate the solution landscape.</p>

<p>As I take a look around my desk, while writing this article, I see at least a dozen physical and virtual elements that distract me. Working from home office during the quarantine did even amplify my inner voices saying: “Chat with your friends instead.”, “That email could be extremely important!”, “Aren’t you hungry?”</p>
<p>Time management issues are among the hottest topics when it comes to organizing work. The above distractions cost the global economy billions of dollars as, according to a recent study, almost 80% of an average workday is spent on activities with low value. Distractions, poor prioritization, procrastination lead to in-effective days and longer-than-needed workdays.</p>
<p><strong>The Pomodoro technique</strong> is a method with a single goal in mind: giving a valid, realistic timeframe in which you can focus, while also allowing you to have regular, yet controlled breaks. Pomodoro is a time management method invented by Italian gentleman Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It was named after a tomato-shaped timer used in the kitchen working with 25-minute time intervals, the predecessor of today’s Pomodoro timer app solutions. The essence of the Pomodoro technique is to do only one task intensively and focused for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Then work again for 25 minutes and break again for 5 minutes. After every fourth Pomodoro-interval, take a longer break of 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t sip a cup of coffee during a 25-minute long Pomodoro, rather be prepared with that coffee beforehand, so that you wouldn’t need to get up your chair and with it fall out from the rhythm and paste you were just picking up.</p>
<h2>What makes this technique so powerful?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Pomodoro is designed to be easy to start with</h3>
    <p>You do not need to populate page-long matrixes, nor estimate all the work for the whole week. It cannot be simpler! There are Pomodoro timer app solutions that don’t even require registration, making it super-easy to kick-off.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps to avoid multitasking</h3>
    <p>Continuous task-switching, regardless of how good you are in multitasking, heavily affects performance. A study by researcher Laura Bowman at Central Connecticut State University sheds light on what happens during a nowadays standard example of task-switching. Students who used Facebook Messenger while reading a textbook took 25% longer to read the same part (excluding time spent on chatting) than students who only used their time reading. The results clearly showed that the quality of performance deteriorates when concentrating on multiple tasks “simultaneously”.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps battling procrastination</h3>
    <p>Studies show that breaking down tasks to the smallest possible parts helps the brain to see them as easy-to-solve tasks, which eventually will hold back procrastination tendencies.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It also helps your body</h3>
    <p>Just use part of the 5-min long pauses to move and flex your back, hip, arms, and legs. Changing the focus distance of your eyes once in a while, aka not looking at your monitor constantly, also helps to keep them healthier. </p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Making good use of the Pomodoro technique</h2>
<p>Here are a few tips on how to nurture this technique to achieve your best self.</p>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Use to-do lists</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro is not simply about pushing a timer or using an app: the number one rule to this technique is to have well-prepared tasks at hand. If you have larger projects, break them down into the smallest parts that you can do. An example: writing an article is a complex project with a lot of research and creative penning. Putting simply “writing an article” on the to-do list is ineffective because it is hard to know how much time and what resources are needed. If you break it down into smaller elements like researching the topic, finding statistics, writing a catchy intro, etc. - that helps your brain to see the big picture and prioritize correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Organize your tasks into pomodoros (tomatoes)</h3>
    <p>These little tomato timeframes should include as many tasks you can handle in a 25-minute long round. The experience will make you better at estimating the right amounts, however, you can do an educated guess if you have done the project breakdown correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Focus, focus, and focus</h3>
    <p>Your 25-minute long Pomodoros should be done with only one thing in mind: finishing your tasks. This might sound too strict at first, but these timeframes are designed in the exact length of an average worker’s/student’s concentration capacity in mind. No emails, no Messenger, and other chats, only your favorite music and the tasks you prepared for yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>After the theory, let’s see how the above can be put into practice. While Francesco Cirillo had fewer distractions back in his day, he did not have a Pomodoro technique app to help him focus. Today’s solutions are much more than simple timers. Let’s see what apps out there you can leverage.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forest app</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.png" alt="Forest logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This application helps you to stay focused and introduces a gamified approach of planting and growing trees. If you start working and use your phone in a non-related way (eg. open Messenger), you get a waring. If you keep switching back from your tasks to less important distractions, your tree will stop growing and will eventually dry out. You are free to set the time frame for how long you want to focus between 10 and 120 minutes. After each period is completed, you receive coins in proportion to how long you have not used your phone. (From which you can buy beautiful trees that are just waiting to be grown.)</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are persistent enough, you can plant a real tree in a designated place, which can be a real motivating force. You can listen to the background noise of a Parisian café or a sandy beach to help to focus.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Setting up 25-minute long intervals in Forest will just do the trick. However, measuring quick breaks and long pauses are not yet available. Still, if you are looking for a great Pomodoro timer app, that helps you focus and forces you - in a gamified way - to do so, Forest is a wonderful choice.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.flatpomodoro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flat Tomato</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.png" alt="FlatTomato logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs, macOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This Mac- and iOS-only application is crafted to fulfill every need of a Pomodoro-er. Wonderful design with easy-to-use interfaces supports you along your day of study and work. You can set tasks, start timers for the different intervals and you can also listen to ambient music and background noises, such as ocean waves, to support your focus. And what makes it a top-ranked, best Pomodoro app? It offers smart reports and analytics to understand what you have done, which, to be honest, gives quite the satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> The app’s core is the Pomodoro technique, and all its features are designed with that in mind.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://www.focustodo.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus To-do</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.png" alt="FocusToDo logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> At first, Focus To-Do seems similar to Flat Tomato and at its core, they both are to help you nurture the Pomodoro technique. However, Focus To-Do offers a complete platform to set up different tasks with categorization, prioritization capabilities. By standard Pomodoro and task management can be done via two different solutions using integrations, Focus To-Do offers them under one umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> You will be able to break down your tasks into small pomodoros and organize them throughout your day. This is by far the best Pomodoro technique app if you are looking for an all-in-one solution.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus Booster</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.png" alt="FocusBooster logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This solution is close to its competitor, Flat Tomato, but is available on all platforms, including on the web via a browser. Its features are centered on the Pomodoro technique. You can set timers, do the intervals and breaks, and review your data after your session on a minimalist, yet beautiful user interface.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> One of the best solutions to utilize the Pomodoro technique as it is easy-to-setup and affordable.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="https://pomofocus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pomofocus</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.png" alt="Pomofocus logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> The most straightforward and minimalistic approach to measure your intervals. You can make the best out of it even as a guest, but then you won't be able to see your results in well-organized charts. If you need to quickly set up your Pomodoro infrastructure, this is the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Stripped down to its very core is by far the most intuitive Pomodoro solution. No app, no install - use it simply by accessing their website and allowing your browser to notify you.</p>
<h2>What makes a Pomodoro application and website effective?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Easy-to-use</h3>
    <p>Any apps should be intuitive to be picked up by users, but it especially stands for solutions meant to make our lives easier. Imagine a software that takes away your time to make you able to get a better performer.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>Managing complex projects nowadays require several software solutions to use and the best way to utilize them is via integrations. Data shared between these apps makes your life so much easier.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <p>Analytics is key not just for your boss to see your performance, but to show results for yourself. It provides satisfaction to see all the tasks you’ve accomplished.</p>
</div>

Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere. Therefore I recommend to prepare qemu as such environment.</p>
<p>For that, you will need …</p></div></article></div>

Every day until December 24th you will get an article, video or other functional programming related content that hopefully will make the waiting feel a bit shorter! 😄</p>
</section><article><section><p>As previous years the articles will span a large range of topics and complexity. If you are looking for something beginner friendly, or more advanced topics, there should be something for everyone these next 23 days.</p>
<p>Let’s start this advent of with a look at the basics: what is functional programming (FP)? This question has been answered many times before, in many different ways. <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/1">We took our own stab at it last year</a>. Even though there are no single definition for FP and many different ways to approach it, there are some things that are shared throughout the related communities.</p>

<p>Today I want to use the words and pictures of Russ Olsen and highlight his talk from GOTO 2018. Russ is a great communicator and I love the down to earth and practical perspective he brings in this talk. He explains functional programming in an understandable way and shows why people prefer FP. I hope you enjoy! </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'run' scripts (and disk images if included in the download)
          were created by volunteers from the QEMU community to showcase cool
          software that QEMU can run.

  </figure><p>To set up your work environment for success, you need to reduce distractions.</p><ul><li><strong>Close Apps you are not using.</strong> I use an app called <a href="https://marco.org/apps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quitter</a> by Marco Arment. It lets you set up rules to close your apps after a set amount of time of it being inactive.</li><li><strong>Organize your files and folders.</strong> It’s a good idea to try to keep projects isolated to their own folder so they are easier to find. <em>I plan to write more about this one in a later article</em>.</li><li><strong>Tweak your notifications.</strong> If you can get away with turning on Do Not Disturb on your computer, this will be the most effective. But if you are expected to be prompt to slack messages and emails this may be a bit more tricky.</li><li><strong>Block distracting websites.</strong> Taking a 5-minute break on reddit can lead to you looking at cats that like loafs of bread an hour later. For Mac, there is a great app called <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Self Control</a> that lets you block certain websites for a set amount of time. The best part is that it’s very hard to get around this filer.</li><li><strong>Buy a good pair of noise-canceling headphones</strong> and find some music that helps you get into a flow state. I have a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ATH-M50x</a> that have been my loyal choice for over 5 years (Not Sponsored <em>yet</em>). Music is one of the most underrated tools for programmers.</li></ul><h2 id="organize-your-tasks">Organize your tasks!</h2><p>For organizing tasks, it's useful to stick to analog. Yes, analog. I bet you thought this was going to be about cool apps huh? Nope, let me introduce you to this cool little thing called Bullet Journaling.</p><h3 id="bullet-journaling">Bullet Journaling</h3><p>At first, I was skeptical of this system but the more I have used it, the more I have fallen in love with it.</p><p>The best approach for bullet journaling is using <em>good ‘ol pencil and paper</em>. Digital apps have the flaw of being in an environment that is full of distractions.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>All you need to get started is:</p><ul><li>A blank or dotted journal 📓</li><li>A pen 🖋</li><li>A passion to get things done. ✍️</li></ul><p>It all starts with an index page. This page will keep your journal organized. Then you create a Future Log, A monthly log, and a daily log. The reason why this system works so well for developers with ADHD is that it's easy to tweak. If you want to have a page for your doodles of Triforces, go for it. If you want to create an elaborate health and fitness tracker, you can do it.</p><p>If you need inspiration, there is no shortage of creative posts on Pintrest and Instagram.</p><p>For more info on Bullet Journaling, I recommend reading the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>I also recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZEEQG6IVE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How To ADHD’s video</a> on bullet journaling.</p><h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2><p>Exercise has proven time and time again to be an excellent tool for just about everything.</p><p>On the mornings where I am not hitting the snooze button until the last moment, I try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise. I notice improvements in my mood and the ability to solve problems quicker.</p><p>It doesn’t need to be intense if you are starting your fitness journey, A walk around the park can do a lot for the mind. Proper exercise <a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adult-adhd-and-exercise#1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is shown</a> to reduce most symptoms of ADHD.</p><h2 id="time-management">Time Management</h2><h3 id="pomodoro-timers">Pomodoro Timers</h3><p>Pomodora timer is a system to make sure you stay focused on a task followed by a short break.</p><p>This is an easy way to ensure that you are giving your mind time to relax and not hyper-focus for too long. Every 25 minutes or so, you take a 5-minute break. Then after 3 “Pomodoras”, you take a 15-minute break. This system forces you to stick to a task with a promised reward of time you can do whatever you want without feeling guilty. That’s the beauty of this system. I’m using one right now while I write this.</p><figure>

I shared the tools I have used to keep myself accountable and productive. Every one of them I have used myself. While these may or may not work for you I encourage you to try them.

Don’t be too hard on yourself when a system doesn’t work for you. Your brain is different. We are programmed to notice small details and think outside of the box. Change is hard and the worst thing you can do is think you are defective.</p><p>I live by this quote from BJ Fogg, the author of <a href="https://www.tinyhabits.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tiny Habits</a>.</p><blockquote><p>People change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.</p></blockquote></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a>, and my personal Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A couple of years ago, at another job, I hired this guy for a data entry position. He seemed like a decently smart guy who could type fairly quickly, even if maybe he was a bit of a bro. He was at the company for well over a year, I'm pretty sure, but my memory is pretty shoddy. He'd earned "Employee of the Month" twice in one year, which was something we debated about and wasn't just a random pick!</p>
<p>Then one morning, he didn't show up to work. No call, no email, nothing. The next day, he still wasn't there. I'm pretty sure it was this day, or the next, I called his emergency contact: his girlfriend; just to make sure he was okay! I wasn't trying to be a nosey up-your-ass manager or anything, it was unusual for him to just no show... plus we needed to know if we needed to hire someone else...</p>
<p>His girlfriend answered the phone. I told her who I was, her boyfriend's manager, and that we hadn't heard from him in two or three days and we're just checking in to make sure he's okay? She said, "Uhh, hold on a second," and hung up the phone. When I called her back (maybe we'd gotten disconnected?) it went to voicemail.</p>
<p>At this point it seemed pretty clear that he wasn't going to come back to work, so we set about looking for his replacement. Pretty lame that he did that, but who knows why people do the things they do? A week or two later, the company got the paperwork from the unemployment office for him. He's trying to get money from the EDD!</p>
<p>The company explains to EDD: No, he no-called, no-showed, he probably shouldn't get unemployment. And then the guy tells EDD: I was actually secretly fired by my manager on the morning of <em>insert date here</em>. But <em>I</em> was his manager! And I didn't do that. I don't know if he elected for it or if it just automatically happened, but a hearing in front of a judge was scheduled for a week later. Normally the company wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to deny someone unemployment, but he just flaked out. Very uncool.</p>
<p>The first absurd thing about the story is that he was a <em>good</em> employee. I had been a manager long enough to know that it's a pain in the ass to hire people, and it sucks when they're not good employees because it's such a waste of time and energy. The last thing I'd want to do is willingly get rid of a good employee. And we had proof he was a good employee: emails I'd sent to others about him; emails I'd sent <em>to</em> him directly, praising him; and the aforementioned two time Employee of the Month receipts.</p>
<p>I also had a bit of an ace up my sleeve: we had security cameras everywhere. He knew this, because he used them sometimes as part of his training. So, trying to be well prepared for the 'hearing' or whatever it would be, I sat down and I exhaustively recorded my whereabouts on the day in question. I noted down every time I left my desk, where I went, how long I was gone, and who was in the rooms with me where I was. I was almost never alone, and always on camera. I'm pretty sure I also prepared a statement, in addition to the email 'evidence packet', just to be thorough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the truth about this guy is that while he was a good employee, he wasn't a happy one. He had bigger aspirations. When getting to know him, I'd asked him what he most wanted to do, for work, with his life, or whatever. He said he wanted to be an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur of what? I asked. He didn't have an answer, it didn't matter, he just wanted to be <em>an entrepreneur</em>.</p>
<p>He wasn't happy that he was a 'lowly' data entry person. We'd tried to get him involved in the inventory security program we had, but looking at camera footage bored him. He asked at one point if the company would pay him while he learned how to grow marijuana, so he could become a sales person and make more money. The company said no, we won't pay you to learn to grow, but we'll give you access to our training program documents so you can learn on your own. Disappointed, he declined the offer. Unfortunately for him, there just weren't any open positions in the company he'd be a good fit for, so he was stuck doing data entry.</p>
<p>This is mostly just making fun of him, but I'll allow it: one day a nearby company put out a pallet of 3M foam earplugs, boxes within boxes, a couple hundred earplugs a piece. We all took a couple boxes. He came to work the next day saying he was going to sell the earplugs online, with photos of Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump glued to them, as a novelty gift, with statements like, "the holidays might get loud this year!" or something. This idea never actually got off the ground.</p>
<p>The day of the hearing, I arrived with the HR assistant and we sat at a long table. My former data-entry clerk was sitting directly across the table from us. Some judge sat down at the end of the table taking notes. I honestly don't remember who spoke first, but the story was pretty simple: He alleged that, sometime on the morning in question, I walked upstairs to where he was working, walked him down through the building, through the back offices, out to the back of building by the street, and told him we'd no longer be needing his services, and he immediately walked down to the bus stop and left.</p>
<p>So I asked him, what time did this happen? And I don't remember what time he said, but it didn't matter, I responded: Well, I have this chart here I made of where I was, and who I was with, for every moment of the day, and at no point was he anywhere to be seen. I submitted that shit into evidence, which wasn't as dramatic as it sounds when you say it that way, all I did was hand it to the judge. The judge asked him if he had any objection to it, and he said of course, and explained that I was in charge of security cameras--true--so I could fake the whole thing or just make up a list. The judge didn't find that very convincing.</p>
<p>I also shared the fact that we knew he wasn't happy, but that otherwise he was a good employee as evidenced by the internal emails, emails to him, and the Employee of the Month awards. He said that we gave out Employee of the Month awards just to quiet down unhappy employees, which is only true sometimes, and may have been why he received it twice in one year without us noticing...</p>
<p>I also asked him some of the more obvious questions: who else witnessed me walk through the building with you? Why didn't you go back upstairs to grab your huge bag of pistachios and other snacks, or to say bye to any of your co-workers? And when I called two days later, and your girlfriend answered, why didn't you talk to me or call me back?</p>
<p>The judge really jumped on that last one, saying: yeah, if this guy fired you, and then called your girlfriend 'pretending' you no-showed, wouldn't you wanna cuss him out or something? Give him a piece of your mind? He didn't have great answers to any of these questions, beyond that he was upset and confused about what happened, so he didn't want to talk to me or anyone.</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing the judge said, I'm pretty sure this is verbatim, "This is a peculiar situation. Two people who have entirely, completely different stories. But you both seem credible. He seems credible, and he seems credible. Very interesting."</p>
<p>Obviously, we received word the judge ruled in our favor a short time later, and rejected his claim for unemployment. He then appealed, this time with a new story. If I remember correctly, he suggested that one of his former managers (before me) didn't like him, and that they were using me to fire him because of it. None of that came up in the hearing, though, and after review of the case by another judge his appeal was rejected.</p>
<p>I don't manage people anymore, and I'm kind of very glad that I don't. I might have had a worse than average experience, because the company wanted to pay people the bare minimum amount needed to hire someone, <em>anyone</em>, and I ended up with employees who were often lazy, dishonest, and manipulative. You'd think being dishonest would take so much effort it'd be better to just do the job you're meant to do, but no.</p>
<p>Prior to this guy, I was used to employees telling bald-faced lies directly to my face, usually ones I couldn't quite prove. But this was the first time that those lies directly involved me, saying I went and did things that I definitely didn't. Luckily, I was sitting in front of an impartial judge, and at absolutely no personal risk whatsoever, so if I failed to prove that fact it wasn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p>But, in different circumstances (like if I worked for a larger company), he could have written a Medium post, or talked to a reporter, and voiced his fabricated mistreatment to the world at large. I could just imagine how the article would account, in detail, his alleged mistreatment ("they wouldn't pay me to learn...") and the day I led him outside and fired him, maliciously, leaving him destitute and dependent on his girlfriend.</p>
<p>And then there'd be a single sentence at the end of the article: "The company denies these allegations." That'd be all the defense I'd get, that the company would be legally allowed to give itself. I mean, I probably wouldn't be named, but I and anyone else working there would know he was talking about me, which could hurt me. Luckily, I'm awesome, and that wouldn't hurt my feelings too much. But there's other people out there, less awesome, and more susceptible to hurt feelings.</p>
<p>The point is: when it comes down to it, sometimes people can be dishonest about work. That can be work they did in the past for other people, or work they're doing right now, for you. People who seem to have a relatively normal level of dysfunctional habits can suddenly, one day, just do something completely unexpected when there's money on the line. It's important to be aware of this, and not just blindly trust everyone who cries mistreatment at the hands of a company. <em>Sometimes</em>, not always, they're just a grifter, looking for sympathy and a handout.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The regex literals optimization avoids running the regex engine on parts of the input text that cannot possibly ever match the regex.</p>

<p>An example of a regex this can be applied to is <code>\w+@\w+\.\w+</code>, where the algorithm <em>quickly</em> finds the first <code>@</code>, then matches <code>\w+</code> backwards to find the start of the match, and then matches <code>\w+\.\w+</code> forward to find the end of the match. It then finds the second <code>@</code>, starting from the end of the previous match, and so on. This is a fairly naive (and incorrect) implementation, but it gives the idea of how it works.</p>

<p>I’ve recently implemented it in my pet project <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/pull/68">nim-regex</a>, an NFA based regex engine that runs in (super)linear time. The results show it’s around ~100x faster than before in some benchmarks. It’s up to ~60x faster than PCRE when the optimization kicks in. The tests are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>.</p>

<p>This is not to be confused with <em>Chivers’ String Prefix Optimization</em>.</p>

<h2 id="literals-optimization">Literals Optimization</h2>

<p>Since nim-regex has to guarantee linear time, I’ll describe optimizations that are guaranteed to take linear time. We must also ensure the matches are not overlapped.</p>

<p>I think the best way to understand how this optimization works is by example. However, here’s a high-level description of the algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We pick a literal that is <code>memchr</code>‘ed to skip parts of the text.</li>
  <li>The prefix is the regex part before the literal; none of the
characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal.</li>
  <li>The prefix is ran backwards to find the start of the match.</li>
  <li>A full scan is ran from the start of the match
until a character that cannot be matched is found (safe break point)
or the end is reached. The scan tries to start the match at every character (NFAs can do this in linear time).</li>
  <li>Go to step one and repeat from the last scanned char. Make the prefix
match until the previous last scanned char.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two important constraints to picking a literal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“none of the characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal”</em>, why? consider the regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and the input text: <code>xxxxxxxxxxx</code>; this would take quadratic time, as the prefix will match until the start of the string every time. What about the limit? while the limit does avoid the excessive matching, sometimes we’d need to match past the limit, ex: regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and text: <code>1xxx</code>. If we add this constraint, the literal becomes a delimeter, and these cases are solved.</li>
  <li>The literal cannot be part of a repetition, nor it can be part of an alternation. For example: <code>(abc)*def</code> the first literal candidate is <code>d</code>, since <code>(abc)*</code> may or may not be part of the match. Same thing for alternations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the main algorithm in <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nim"><span>func</span> <span>findAll</span><span>(</span>
  <span>matches</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>Matches</span><span>,</span>

    <span>limit</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>  <span># rather pointless since the literal is a delimiter</span>

<p>A given character may be consumed only twice, once by the backward prefix match, and a second time by the forward scan. Hence the algorithm runs in linear time.</p>

<p>I may describe how <code>matchPrefix</code> and <code>findSome</code> work, how to construct the reversed NFA in the right order, and how to pick the literal in a future article. The nim-regex code contains descriptions of the algorithms, though.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/tree/master/bench">benchmarks</a> regexes are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>. The only difference is the regexes are pre-compiled, so just the matching is tested. The results show nim-regex is ~63x faster than PCRE in the email test, and ~2x faster in the URI and IP tests.</p>

<p>Why is nim-regex so fast in the email case? The regex engine doesn’t run as often. There are orders of magnitud more IP/URI candidates than email candidates (<code>@</code> chars within the text) to match. In the former case the time is dominated by the regex engine, while in the latter case it’s dominated by searching the char literal.</p>

  <p>Note Nim’s PCRE is at the top of the mariomka/regex-benchmark. I ran those benchmarks, and IIRC nim-regex was just a bit faster, mainly because the non-macro regex engine is slower (see the above results), and the regex compilation is also tested.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="other-optimizations">Other optimizations</h2>

<p>Here are other possible optimizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Picking a literal —even if the prefix matches it— should take linear time as long as the prefix is bounded (i.e: does not contain repetitions), ex: <code>\d\wx</code>.</li>
  <li>Picking a literal within a “one or more” repetition/repetition group should be possible, since <code>(abc)+</code> matches the same as <code>abc(abc)*</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s better to pick the last literal within the first literal sequence, since that way we always try to match as many literals as possible early on, and potentially fail early. We want to keep the prefix regex as short as possible, so the picking a literal in the first sequence is best.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized this very same way in some cases, ex: <code>bar|baz</code>, since both alternations have <code>ba</code> in common, <code>a</code> can be picked as the literal.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized in other cases. PCRE seems to use <code>memchr</code> or similar for up to two alternation terms. A DFA could be used to quickly match candidates instead of <code>memchr</code>, as that’s a more general solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Literals optimization is not a general optimization as it does not work on every regex, but when it does, it can greatly improve the matching speed.</p>

<p>Can a backtracker like PCRE implement this? PCRE in particular already has some sort of similar optimization, but it’s not as good/fast as this one. Backtrackers usually guarantee constant space, so they cannot implement this as described here exactly, but they can do something similar that requires backtracking. If they either provide a resumable <code>find</code> function, or relax this constraint, then probably yes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, more regex engines will implement these sort of optimizations, so they are more compelling alternatives to backtrackers such as PCRE.</p>

<h2><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h2>



<p>In the publication entitled “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR” (Eurosurveillance 25(8) 2020) the authors present a diagnostic workflow and RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV (now known as SARS-CoV-2), which they claim to be validated, as well as being a robust diagnostic methodology for use in public-health laboratory settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of all the consequences resulting from this very publication for societies worldwide, a group of independent researchers performed a point-by-point review of the aforesaid publication in which 1) all components of the presented test design were cross checked, 2) the RT-qPCR protocol-recommendations were assessed w.r.t. good laboratory practice, and 3) parameters examined against relevant scientific literature covering the field.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The published RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV and the manuscript suffer from numerous technical and scientific errors, including insufficient primer design, a problematic and insufficient RT-qPCR protocol, and the absence of an accurate test validation. Neither the presented test nor the manuscript itself fulfils the requirements for an acceptable scientific publication. Further, serious conflicts of interest of the authors are not mentioned. Finally, the very short timescale between submission and acceptance of the publication (24 hours) signifies that a systematic peer review process was either not performed here, or of problematic poor quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide compelling evidence of several scientific inadequacies, errors and flaws. </p><p>Considering the scientific and methodological blemishes presented here, we are confident that the editorial board of Eurosurveillance has no other choice but to retract the publication.</p></div>







<h2><strong>CONCISE REVIEW REPORT</strong></h2>



<div><p>This paper will show numerous serious flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper, the significance of which has led to worldwide misdiagnosis of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and associated with the disease COVID-19. We are confronted with stringent lockdowns which have destroyed many people’s lives and livelihoods, limited access to education and these imposed restrictions by governments around the world are a direct attack on people’s basic rights and their personal freedoms, resulting in collateral damage for entire economies on a global scale.</p><p><strong>There are ten fatal problems with the Corman-Drosten paper which we will outline and explain in greater detail in the following sections.</strong></p></div>



<p>The first and major issue is that the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020 named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of virus experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China [1], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof. According to Corman et al.:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.”</em> [1]</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The focus here should be placed upon the two stated aims: a) <em>development</em> and b) <em>deployment of a diagnostic test for use in public health laboratory settings</em>. These aims are not achievable without having any actual virus material available (e.g. for determining the infectious viral load). In any case, only a protocol with maximal accuracy can be the mandatory and primary goal in any scenario-outcome of this magnitude. Critical viral load determination is mandatory information, and it is in Christian Drosten’s group responsibility to perform these experiments and provide the crucial data.</p>



<div><p>Nevertheless these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid virus. This model was based on the assumption that the novel virus is very similar to SARS-CoV from 2003 as both are beta-coronaviruses.</p><p>The PCR test was therefore designed using the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV as a control material for the Sarbeco component; we know this from our personal email-communication with [2] one of the co-authors of the Corman-Drosten paper. This method to model SARS-CoV-2 was described in the Corman-Drosten paper as follows:</p></div>



<blockquote><p><em>“<strong>the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV</strong> <strong>screening and specific confirmation, designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.”</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p>The Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is an important biomolecular technology to rapidly detect rare RNA fragments, which are known in advance. In the first step, RNA molecules present in the sample are reverse transcribed to yield cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified in the polymerase chain reaction using a specific primer pair and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. The technology is highly sensitive and its detection limit is theoretically 1 molecule of cDNA. The specificity of the PCR is highly influenced by biomolecular design errors.</p>



<h3><strong>What is important when designing an RT-PCR Test and the quantitative RT-qPCR test described in the Corman-Drosten publication?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>1. The primers and probes:</strong></h5>



<p>a) the concentration of primers and probes must be of optimal range <br>(100-200 nM)<br>b) must be specific to the target-gene you want to amplify<br>c) must have an optimal percentage of GC content relative to the total nitrogenous bases (minimum 40%, maximum 60%)<br>d) for virus diagnostics at least 3 primer pairs must detect 3 viral genes (preferably as far apart as possible in the viral genome)</p>



<h5><strong>2. The temperature at which all reactions take place:</strong></h5>



<p>a) DNA melting temperature (&gt;92°)<br>b) DNA amplification temperature (TaqPol specific)<br>c) Tm; the annealing temperature (the temperature at which the primers and probes reach the target binding/detachment, not to exceed 2 ̊C per primer pair). Tm heavily depends on GC content of the primers</p>



<h5><strong>3. The number of amplification cycles (less than 35; preferably 25-30 cycles);</strong></h5>



<p>In case of virus detection, &gt;35 cycles only detects signals which do not correlate with infectious virus as determined by isolation in cell culture [reviewed in 2]; if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe &amp; the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, the probability that said result is a false positive is 97% [reviewed in 3]</p>



<h5><strong>4. Molecular biological validations; amplified PCR products must be validated either by running the products in a gel with a DNA ruler, or by direct DNA sequencing</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>5. Positive and negative controls should be specified to confirm/refute specific virus detection</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>6. There should be a Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) available</strong></h5>



<p>SOP unequivocally specifies the above parameters, so that all laboratories are able to set up the exact same test conditions. To have a validated universal SOP is essential, because it enables the comparison of data within and between countries.</p>



<h3><strong>MINOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<p>1. In Table 1 of the Corman-Drosten paper, different abbreviations are stated – “nM” is specified, “nm” isn’t. Further in regards to correct nomenclature, nm means “nanometer” therefore nm should read nM here.</p>



<p>2. It is the general consensus to write genetic sequences always in the 5’-3’ direction, including the reverse primers. It is highly unusual to do alignment with reverse complementary writing of the primer sequence as the authors did in figure 2 of the Corman-Drosten paper. Here, in addition, a wobble base is marked as “y” without description of the bases the Y stands for.</p>



<p>3. Two misleading pitfalls in the Corman-Drosten paper are that their Table 1 does not include Tm-values (annealing-temperature values), neither does it show GC-values (number of G and C in the sequences as %-value of total bases).</p>



<h3><strong>MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<h4>A) BACKGROUND</h4>



<div><p>The authors introduce the background for their scientific work as: “The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travelers does already occur”.</p><p>According to BBC News [4] and Google Statistics [5] there were 6 deaths world-wide on January 21st 2020 – the day when the manuscript was submitted. Why did the authors assume a challenge for public health laboratories while there was no substantial …</p></div></article></div>

                Most people find the film (even in its surviving truncated versions) 
                rather brilliant, but Wells didn't like it much, perhaps because 
                he believes it was 'plagiarized' from his "When The Sleeper 
                Wakes."</p></span></i></p>
<p>I have recently seen the silliest film.  </p>
<p>I do not believe it
would be possible to make one sillier.  </p>
<p>And as this film sets out to display the
way the world is going,  </p>
<p>I think [my book] The Way the World is Going may very
well concern itself with this film.  </p>
<p>It is called Metropolis, it comes from the
great Ufa studios in Germany, and the public is given to understand that it has
been produced at enormous cost.  </p>
<p>It gives in one eddying concentration almost
every possible foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical
progress and progress in general served up with a sauce of sentimentality that
is all its own.</p>
<p><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro163.jpg" width="485" height="745"></p>
<p>It is a
German film and there have been some amazingly good German films, before they
began to cultivate bad work under cover of a protective quota. And this film has
been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon taste, and quite possibly it has suffered in the
process, but even when every allowance has been made for that, there remains
enough to convince the intelligent observer that most of its silliness must be
fundamental.  </p>
<p>Possibly I dislike this soupy whirlpool none the less because I
find decaying fragments of my own juvenile work of thirty years ago, The Sleeper
Awakes, floating about in it. </p>
<p>Capek's Robots have been lifted without apology,
and that soulless mechanical monster of Mary Shelley's, who has fathered so many
German inventions, breeds once more in this confusion.  </p>
<p>Originality there is
none. Independent thought, none.  </p>
<p>Where nobody has imagined for them the authors
have simply fallen back on contemporary things.  </p>
<p>The aeroplanes that wander about above the great city show no 
advance on contemporary types, though all that stuff could have been livened up 
immensely with a few helicopters and vertical or unexpected movements. </p>
<p>The motor cars are 1926 models or earlier. I do not think there 
is a single new idea, a single instance of artistic creation or even intelligent 
anticipation, from first to last in the whole pretentious stew; I may have 
missed some point of novelty, but I doubt it; and this, though it must bore the 
intelligent man in the audience, makes the film all the more convenient as a 
gauge of the circle of ideas, the mentality, from which it has proceeded.</p>
<p>The word Metropolis, says the advertisement in English, 'is
in itself symbolic of greatness'- which only shows us how wise it is to consult
a dictionary before making assertions about the meaning of words.  </p>
<p>Probably it
was the adapter who made that shot. The German 'Neubabelsburg' was better, and
could have been rendered 'New Babel'. It is a city, we are told, of 'about one
hundred years hence.' It is represented as being enormously high; and all the
air and happiness are above and the workers live, as the servile toilers in the
blue uniform in The Sleeper Awakes lived, down, down, down below.</p>
<p>Now far away in the dear old 1897 it may have been excusable
to symbolize social relations in this way, but that was thirty years ago, and a
lot of thinking and some experience intervene.  </p>
<p>That vertical city of the future
we know now is, to put it mildly, highly improbable. Even in New York and
Chicago, where the pressure on the central sites is exceptionally great, it is
only the central office and entertainment region that soars and excavates. And
the same centripetal pressure that leads to the utmost exploitation of site
values at the centre leads also to the driving out of industrialism and labour
from the population center to cheaper areas, and of residential life to more
open and airy surroundings. That was all discussed and written about before
1900. Somewhere about 1930 the geniuses of Ufa studios will come up to a book of
Anticipations which was written more than a quarter of a century ago. The
British census returns of 1901 proved clearly that city populations were
becoming centrifugal, and that every increase in horizontal traffic facilities
produced a further distribution. This vertical social stratification is stale
old stuff. So far from being 'a hundred years hence,' Metropolis, in its forms
and shapes, is already, as a possibility, a third of a century out of date.</p>
<p>But its form is the least part of its staleness. This great
city is supposed to be evoked by a single dominating personality. The English
version calls him John Masterman, so that there may be no mistake about his
quality. Very unwisely he has called his son Eric, instead of sticking to good
hard John, and so relaxed the strain. He works with an inventor, one Rotwang,
and they make machines. There are a certain number of other people, and the
'sons of the rich' are seen disporting themselves, with underclad ladies in a
sort of joy conservatory, rather like the 'winter garden' of an enterprising
1890 hotel during an orgy. The rest of the population is in a state of abject
slavery, working in 'shifts' of ten hours in some mysteriously divided
twenty-four hours, and with no money to spend or property or freedom. The
machines make wealth. How, is not stated. We are shown rows of motor cars all
exactly alike; but the workers cannot own these, and no 'sons of the rich'
would. Even the middle classes nowadays want a car with personality. Probably
Masterman makes these cars in endless series to amuse himself.</p>
              <p><span face="Times New Roman"><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro50.jpg" width="254" height="430"></span>One 
                is asked to believe that these machines are engaged quite furiously 
                in the mass production of nothing that is ever used, and that 
                Masterman grows richer and richer in the process. This is the 
                essential nonsense of it all. Unless the mass of the population 
                has the spending power there is no possibility of wealth in a 
                mechanical civilization. A vast, penniless slave population may 
                be necessary for wealth where there are no mass production machines, 
                but it is preposterous with mass production machines. You find 
                such a real proletariat in China still; it existed in the great 
                cities of the ancient world; but you do not find it in America, 
                which has gone furtherest in the direction of mechanical industry, 
                and there is no grain of reason in supposing it will exist in 
                the future. Masterman's watchword is 'Efficiency,' and you are 
                given to understand it is a very dreadful word, and the contrivers 
                of this idiotic spectacle are so hopelessly ignorant of all the 
                work that has been done upon industrial efficiency that they represent 
                him as working his machine-minders to the point of exhaustion, 
                so that they faint and machines explode and people are scalded 
                to death. You get machine-minders in torment turning levers in 
                response to signals - work that could be done far more effectively 
                by automata. Much stress is laid on the fact that the workers 
                are spiritless, hopeless drudges, working reluctantly and mechanically. 
                But a mechanical civilization has no use for mere drudges; the 
                more efficient its machinery the less need there is for the quasi-mechanical 
                minder. It is the inefficient factory that needs slaves; the ill-organized 
                mine that kills men. The hopeless drudge stage of human labour 
                lies behind us. With a sort of malignant stupidity this film contradicts 
                these facts.</p>
<p>The current tendency of economic life is to oust the mere
drudge altogether, to replace much highly skilled manual work by exquisite
machinery in skilled hands, and to increase the relative proportion of
semi-skilled, moderately versatile and fairly comfortable workers. It may indeed
create temporary masses of unemployed, and in The Sleeper Awakes there was a
mass of unemployed people under the hatches. That was written in 1897, when the
possibility of restraining the growth of large masses of population had scarcely
dawned on the world. It was reasonable then to anticipate an embarrassing
underworld of under-productive people. We did not know what to do with the
abyss. But there is no excuse for that today. And what this film anticipates is
not unemployment, but drudge employment, which is precisely what is passing
away. Its fabricators have not even realized that the machine ousts the drudge.</p>
<p>'Efficiency' means large-scale productions, machinery as
fully developed as possible, and <i>high</i> <i>wages</i>. The British
Government delegation sent to study success in America has reported unanimously
to that effect. The increasingly efficient industrialism of America has so
little need of drudges that it has set up the severest barriers against the
flooding of the United States by drudge immigration. 'Ufa' knows nothing of such
facts.</p>
<p>A young woman appears from nowhere in particular to 'help'
these drudges; she impinges upon Masterman's son Eric, and they go to the
'Catacombs,' which, in spite of the gas mains, steam mains, cables, and
drainage, have somehow contrived to get over from Rome, skeletons and all, and
burrow under this city of Metropolis. She conducts a sort of Christian worship
in these unaccountable caverns, and the drudges love and trust her. With a nice
sense of fitness she lights herself about the Catacombs with a torch instead of
the electric lamps that are now so common.</p>
<p>That reversion to torches is quite typical …</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability. You can treat a system as a blackbox, without really knowing anything about it, and run all kinds of interesting analysis: count the most frequently called functions, trace network packets, do performance tracing and debugging, etc.</p><p>There are a myriad of tools that you can use to observe every component of the system: the CPU, memory, file system, networking, containers, applications…</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b19abde4b1ccfe4ce140969c8bf44f39d1c2fe70/f9ed3/images/ebpf/bcc_tracing_tools_early2019.png" alt="ebpf-tracing-tools"><figcaption>BCC performance tools (courtesy of Brendan Gregg)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve only scratched the surface on this subject and I can’t wait to learn more about it, as well as Linux performance in general.

<p>In the intensive care unit, patients receive treatment and therapies to prevent them from immediately dying. It’s not pleasant, but it’s true. You don’t want to come see us. </p>



<p>We see the signs and messages. “Thank you, Frontline Workers!” Honestly, it’s confusing. We aren’t your frontline. We are your last resort. And, after eight months, we are tired. Nurses are <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201804-269PS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnt out</a>. Some organizations <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2516043520957565" target="_blank">did not take care of their employees</a> well when COVID hit. Many nurses are leaving their jobs. Most units are experiencing staffing crises. There just simply aren’t enough nurses to take care of all of you. You don’t want to visit the ICU during normal circumstances. You certainly don’t want to be a patient in one now.</p>



<p>ICU beds usually run at about 70-80% capacity. It’s a sweet spot where the unit can function from an operational standpoint while still having bed availability for emergencies or cyclical unit flow. With the first wave of COVID, some ICUs were operating at 200-300% capacity. The bed crisis in itself wasn’t a huge one. A bed is a bed is a bed. Organizations simply <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19" target="_blank">opened more ICUs</a> in other areas of the hospital. It wasn’t pretty or comfortable, but it worked.</p>



<p>The real crisis came with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/19/covid19-hospitals-in-half-the-states-facing-massive-staffing-shortage/" target="_blank">staff</a>. Who was going to take care of all of these extra patients? Organizations employed many strategies. Nurses managed ICU patients <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aacnjournals.org/ccnonline/article/40/4/25/31008/Answering-the-Call-Impact-of-Tele-ICU-Nurses" target="_blank">remotely,</a> sometimes from other states. Hospitals sought help from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://khn.org/news/highly-paid-traveling-nurses-fill-staffing-shortages-during-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank">staffing agencies</a> and per diem staff. Non-ICU nurses were quickly “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rcni.com/nursing-standard/careers/career-advice/covid-19-what-to-expect-if-you-are-deployed-to-a-critical-care-setting-159646" target="_blank">upskilled</a>” to the critical care setting. In short, an already precarious situation just became even more dangerous.</p>



<p>Nurses new to the ICU setting usually go through an intense training program which includes classroom and clinical experience and ranges from three to six months in length. Upon completion of this program, they are still novice nurses and rely on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://healthresearchfunding.org/patricia-benner-novice-to-expert-nursing-theory-explained/" target="_blank">expert</a> colleagues for mentoring and guidance. As crucial as upskilled nurses are, they are still short on education, knowledge, and experience. In our current climate, nurses are working in unfamiliar environments, with a team they don’t know, with fewer resources, fewer experienced staff, and with higher staffing ratios. All of this can and will lead to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/nursing-and-patient-safety" target="_blank">unfavorable outcomes</a>.</p>



<p>COVID has now been around long enough that we are somewhat in a clinical routine. The patient H&amp;P’s (history and physical) are eerily similar. “Patient attended a family birthday party.” “Patient attended weekly bowling league.” “Masks were not worn.” “Attendees did not appropriately socially distance.” By the time the patient gets to us, they are in bad shape. </p>



<p>They can not breathe without the help of a ventilator. Breathing on a ventilator is very uncomfortable and unnatural. Lung injury in COVID is so profound that patients usually require the most extreme settings, which require heavy sedation and paralytics. If the patient still isn’t ventilating adequately, we will <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKpvGr4KntAhUo2FkKHR_-DwoQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Ffullarticle%2F2769872&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mk45rzzxRWxBCOd7Thav5" target="_blank">prone</a> them.

If they spike an uncontrollable fever, we will put them on an ice blanket. We will bring iPads into the room and update families on the phone. The patient will be alone.</p>



<p>All of this will either work, or it won’t. The average ICU length of stay is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.lww.com/healthcaremanagerjournal/Abstract/2014/04000/Reduction_of_Intensive_Care_Unit_Length_of_Stay_.5.aspx#:~:text=The%20average%20ICU%20length%20of%20stay%20%28LOS%29%20is,an%20additional%201.5%20days%20in%20a%20non-ICU%20bed" target="_blank">3.3 days</a>. The average ICU length of stay with COVID is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01726-3" target="_blank">19 days</a>. Prior to COVID, over half of ICU patients experienced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.posticu.org/" target="_blank">post intensive care syndrome (PICS)</a> after their discharge. This syndrome includes depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits, sometimes limiting their ability to work or care for themselves. The after-effects of an ICU admission with COVID have not yet been studied. Those who don’t get better, will die.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's talk about objects in functional languages.</p>

<p>This could be a sticking point, so I'll get this out of the way up-front: I find arguments over whether such-and-such a thing is “really” functional or “really” imperative or “really” object-oriented to be for the most part frustrating and useless. A lot of these arguments boil down to value judgments in disguise (a thing I've touched on in the past when <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/proofs-and-programs-and-rhetoric" rel="nofollow">talking about the rhetorical emphasis placed on math in programming</a>) and many of the rest turn out to be based on informal definitions where 'functional' means 'like my favorite or first functional language'.<sup id="fnref:samp"><a href="#fn:samp" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> I prefer to think about these concept less in terms of necessary criteria and hard lines, and more in terms of influence and approach and focus.</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On Understanding Data Abstraction Revisited</em> by William Cook</a> (itself a paper that revisits <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.A4.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On understanding data types, data abstraction, and polymorphism</em> by Luca Cardelli and Peter Wegner</a>) lays out simple definitions of the often-used concepts of “abstract data type” and “object”. His definition of “object” is, of course, not the only one, but I think it's a useful one. Importantly, Cook's definition is based on abstract criteria that can apply even when the language itself does not have an explicit concept of an “object”. To emphasize this, I'm going to use Haskell in this blog post to demonstrate a pure functional variation on “object-oriented programming”<sup id="fnref:lang"><a href="#fn:lang" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Beyond being a useful definition, Cook's formulation is also a valuable design pattern, one which has both advantages and disadvantages when designing programs. Consequently, the goal of this blog post is twofold: first, to show how “objects” can (under some definition) exist in a language like Haskell which has no built-in notion of “object-oriented programming”, and secondly, to show the advantages and disadvantages of code written in this style.</p>



<p>Cook's definition of an <em>abstract data type</em> is a type that</p>

<blockquote><p>[…] has a public name, a hidden representation, and operations to create, combine, and observe values of the abstraction.</p></blockquote>

<p>To use a simplified version of his example, here's a (not terribly efficient) way of defining a “set of integers” in Haskell as an abstract data type. In this case, we've got an <code>IntSet</code> type whose representation can be easily hidden, because the operations that a consumer of this library cares about about have been defined in terms of that abstract representation.</p>

<pre><code>-- we'll export `IntSet` but not the constructors
data IntSet
  = SetEmpty
  | SetInsert Int IntSet

empty :: IntSet
empty = SetEmpty

isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
isEmpty SetEmpty = True
isEmpty _ = False

insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
insert x set
  | contains set x = set
  | otherwise = SetInsert x set

contains :: IntSet -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool
contains SetEmpty x = False
contains (SetInsert y rest) x
  | x == y = True
  | otherwise = contains rest x
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably not a terribly controversial definition or design: it's a pretty typical one for most functional languages! …well, it might be controversial to <em>use</em> since it's got awful algorithmic performance, but it's fairly unobjectionable as a teaching tool, at least.</p>

<p>What would a user see when looking at the documentation for this module? Since we're not exporting the constructors for <code>IntSet</code>, it'll look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data IntSet
empty :: IntSet
isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
contains :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to hide the definition of <code>IntSet</code> is the thing that makes this an abstract data type. A user of the library doesn't care—and ideally doesn't <em>need</em> to care—what constructors hide behind that <code>IntSet</code>.</p>



<p>Cook then goes on to describe “objects”. Here's another (equally inefficient) implementation of <code>IntSet</code>, which I'll define as <code>OIntSet</code> so I can easily refer to both:</p>

<pre><code>data OIntSet = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty :: Bool
  , oContains :: Int -&gt; Bool
  }

oEmpty :: OIntSet
oEmpty = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = True
  , oContains = \_ -&gt; False
  }

oInsert :: Int -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oInsert x set
  | oContains set x = set
  | otherwise = OIntSet
      { oIsEmpty = False
      , oContains = \i -&gt; i == x || oContains set i
      }
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible that we can choose our export list carefully so that this implementation of <code>OIntSet</code> reveals the exact same set of operations as the previous one. However, there's a major difference here: <code>OIntSet</code> is not actually hiding a specific type. Instead, it just bundles the relevant set of operations inside of a record of functions, which acts like an interface type. In both the ADT-based approach and the “object”-based approach, a user does not know about the internal representation of <code>OIntSet</code>, but in the ADT approach, this is because there exists a single representation which is non-public, while in the “object”-based approach, there may be multiple separate implementations that are indistinguishable.</p>



<p>An “object”-like representation allows for a vast amount of flexibility. Because a consumer of an <code>OIntSet</code> can use any value as long as the value has provided implementations of the relevant “methods”, we can easily and conveniently define new instances of <code>OIntSet</code> that have radically different internal representations. For example, we can define infinite sets that use simple numerical computations to define their <code>oContains</code> method, like this set of all even numbers:</p>

<pre><code>oEvenNumbers :: OIntSet
oEvenNumbers = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = False
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `mod` 2 == 0
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Or we could construct <code>OIntSet</code> values that use a different data representation, such as a list, to store the members of the set:</p>

<pre><code>oFromList :: [Int] -&gt; OIntSet
oFromList list = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = null list
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `elem` list
  }
</code></pre>

<p>But even though these <code>OIntSet</code> definitions use different underlying data representations, they expose the same interface, so we can use the same operations to manipulate them. For example, we can define an <code>oUnion</code> operation which computes the union of two <code>OIntSet</code> objects, since that operation is easily expressible in terms of <code>oIsEmpty</code> and <code>oContains</code>:</p>

<pre><code>oUnion :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oUnion set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = oIsEmpty set &amp;&amp; oIsEmpty set'
  , oContains = \i -&gt; oContains set i || oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>oUnion</code> operation—indeed, any operation we define—can work on any two <code>OIntSet</code>s even if they have wildly different internal representations. We can even use this to combine all of our previously-defined <code>OIntSet</code> constructors into one expression, to create a set that uses a combination of Haskell lists, numeric predicates, and closures to represent a set:</p>

<pre><code>sample :: OIntSet
sample = oInsert 1 oEvenNumbers `oUnion` oFromList [10..20]
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very convenient way of building certain abstractions. By building around external interfaces, you can include varying data representations that easily work together.</p>

<p>This example is clearly a little bit contrived, so it's probably worth giving some other “real-world” examples where this design approach is useful. Object-oriented programming is generally cited as a good fit for a particular style of user interface programming, because it allows you to define classes of “widgets” that expose a common interface but have different internal representations. You could build a Haskell GUI library in this style by defining <code>Widgets</code> as “objects” with a common interface, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data Widget = Widget
  { drawWidget :: Ctx -&gt; Position -&gt; IO ()
  , handleEvent :: Event -&gt; IO ()
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to the approach taken by the <a href="https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/" rel="nofollow">Brick TUI library</a>, which has <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick-0.54/docs/Brick-Types.html#t:Widget" rel="nofollow">its own <code>Widget</code> record</a>.</p>



<p>One major concern with this style of data representation is performance and optimization. Consider our original ADT representation for <code>IntSet</code>: it's inefficient, yes, but we can make it more efficient in a number of ways. For example, we could modify it so that, instead of always inserting new elements “at the front”, we can instead insert them in such a way that the internal representation of the set is always sorted lowest-to-highest. This means that we may no longer have to traverse the entire list to check for element membership. Even better, we might swap out the list-like representation for a binary tree representation, maybe doing some rebalancing in certain cases.</p>

<p>There is no way <em>in general</em> to apply these optimizations to the <code>OIntSet</code>-style program. You could define an <code>OIntSet</code> that sits in front of a balanced tree and therefore has faster lookup and insertion, but once it's sitting behind the interface, you no longer have access to those internals. You cannot, for example, write an <code>oUnion</code> operation that rebalances the binary trees behind the two sets it's operating on: it doesn't even know if both sets <em>are</em> backed by trees!</p>

<p>In effect, the major selling point of the “object”-style design here is also a major downside: you don't have guarantees about the specific representation of data, which means your programs can easily mix-and-match different representations, but it also means that your program can't make use of representation-specific knowledge in ways that are advantageous.</p>

<p>There's another major concern as well, and that's that the specific choice of “object” representation can make a big difference in terms of what operations you can and cannot support. Look back at <code>OIntSet</code>—I was able to define <code>oUnion</code>, but what about <code>oIntersection</code>? It turns out that it's not actually possible using the specific representation I've chosen<sup id="fnref:perf"><a href="#fn:perf" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>oIntersection :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oIntersection set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = {- ??? -}
  , oIntersection = \i -&gt; oContains set i &amp;&amp; oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>How do I implement <code>oIsEmpty</code>? I might naïvely try to write the inverse of <code>oUnion</code> and define it as <code>oIsEmpty set || oIsEmpty set'</code>, but that's not at all what I want: the intersection of the set of even numbers and the set of odd numbers is an empty set, but neither the even nor the odd numbers are empty, so this would incorrectly compute their …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://nns.ee/blog/2019/03/21/chroot-shenanigans.html">In my previous post</a>, I described running Arch on an OpenWRT router. Today, I’ll be taking it a step further and running Arch and a full LXDE installation natively on an Amazon Kindle, which can be interacted with directly using the touch screen. This is possible thanks to the Kindle’s operating system being Linux!
<!--description--></p>

<p>You can see the end result in action <a href="https://youtu.be/Bx386xpDqCY">here</a>. Apologies for the shaky video - it was shot using my phone and no tripod.</p>

<p>If you’re wanting to follow along, make sure you’ve <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/5_x_Jailbreak">rooted your Kindle</a> beforehand. This is essential – without it, it’s impossible to run custom scripts or binaries.</p>

<p>I’m testing this on an 8th generation Kindle (KT3) – it should, however, work for all recent Kindles given you’ve enough storage and are rooted. You also need to set up <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030">USBnetwork</a> for SSH access and optionally <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326">KUAL</a> if you want a simple way of launching the chroot.</p>

<p>First things first: We need to set up a filesystem and extract an Arch installation into it, which we can later chroot into. The filesystem will be a file which will be mounted as a loop device. The reason why we’re not extracting the Arch installation directly into a directory on the Kindle is because the Kindle’s storage filesystem is FAT32. FAT32 doesn’t support required features such as symbolic links, which would break the Arch installation. Please note that this also means that your chroot filesystem can be 4 gigabytes large, at maximum. This can be worked around by mounting the real root inside the chroot filesystem, which it’s still a hacky way to go about it. But I digress.</p>

<p>First, figure out how large your filesystem actually can be. SSH into your Kindle and see how much free space you have:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>df</span> <span>-k</span> /mnt/base-us
<span>Filesystem   1K-blocks  Used    Available  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/loop/0  3188640    361856  2826784    11%   /mnt/base-us
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seems like we have around 2800000K (around 2.8G) of space available. Let’s make our filesystem 2.6G – it’s enough to host our root filesystem and some extra applications, such as LXDE. Note that I’ll be running the following commands on my PC and transferring the filesystem over later. You can also do all of this on the Kindle, but it’s simply easier and faster this way.</p>

<p>Let’s create a blank file of the wanted size. I’m using <code>dd</code>, but you can also use <code>fallocate</code> for this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>arch.img <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1024 <span>count</span><span>=</span>2600000
<span>2600000+0 records in
2600000+0 records out
2662400000 bytes (2.7 GB, 2.5 GiB) copied, 6.92058 s, 385 MB/s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s create our filesystem on it. Since we’re doing this on the PC, we need make it 32bit and disable the <code>metadata_csum</code> and <code>huge_file</code> options on the filesystem, as the Kindle’s ext4 kernel doesn’t support them.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>mkfs.ext4 <span>-O</span> ^64bit,^metadata_csum,^huge_file arch.img
<span>mke2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)
Discarding device blocks: done                            
Creating filesystem with 650000 4k blocks and 162560 inodes
Filesystem UUID: a4e72620-368a-44b4-81bb-9e66b2903523
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (16384 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is optional, but I’ll also disable periodic filesystem checks on it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>tune2fs <span>-c</span> 0 <span>-i</span> 0 arch.img                               
<span>tune2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)         
Setting maximal mount count to -1
Setting interval between checks to 0 seconds
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next it’s time to mount the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>rootfs
<span>$</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>mount <span>-o</span> loop arch.img rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kindle I’m using has a Cortex-A9-based processor, so let’s download the ARMv7 version of Arch Linux ARM from <a href="http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz">here</a>. You can download it and extract then, or simply download and extract at the same time:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>curl <span>-L</span> http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz | <span>sudo tar </span>xz <span>-C</span> rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>sudo</code> is required to extract as it sets up a lot of files with root permissions. You can ignore the errors about <code>SCHILY.fflags</code>. Verify that the files extracted successfully with <code>ls -l rootfs/</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s prepare our Kindle for the filesystem. I opted for hosting the filesystem in <code>extensions/karch</code> as I want to use KUAL for easy launching:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, it’s also a good idea to stop the power daemon to prevent the Kindle from going into sleep mode while transferring the filesystem and interrupting our transfer:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>stop powerd
<span>powerd stop/waiting
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s transfer our filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>Connection to 192.168.15.244 closed.

</span><span>$</span><span> </span>scp arch.img root@192.168.15.244:/mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This might take quite a bit of time, depending on your connection.</p>

<p>Once it’s done, let’s SSH in once again and set up our mountpoint:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cd</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>system
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to set up my own loop device, so I can have it named, but you can ignore this and opt to use <code>/dev/loop/12</code> or similar instead. Just make sure it’s already not in use with <code>mount</code>.</p>

<p>Setting up a loop point and mounting the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mknod</span> <span>-m0660</span> /dev/loop/karch b 7 250
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>loop</span><span>=</span>/dev/loop/karch <span>-t</span> ext4 arch.img system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should also mount some system directories into it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev system/dev
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev/pts system/dev/pts
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /proc system/proc
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /sys system/sys
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /tmp system/tmp
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cp</span> /etc/hosts system/etc/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s time to chroot into our new system and set it up for LXDE. You can also use this opportunity to set up whatever applications you need, such as an onscreen keyboard:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/locale.gen 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>locale-gen
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>rm</span> /etc/resolv.conf 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'nameserver 8.8.8.8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/resolv.conf
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--init</span> <span># this will take a while</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--populate</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-Syu</span> <span>--noconfirm</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-S</span> lxde xorg-server-xephyr <span>--noconfirm</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use Xephyr because it’s the easiest way to get our LXDE session up and running. Since the Kindle uses X11 natively, we can try using that. It’s possible to stop the native window manager using <code>stop lab126_gui</code> outside the chroot, but then the Kindle will stop updating the screen with new data, leaving it blank – forcing you to use something like <code>eips</code> to refresh the screen. The X server still works, however, and you can confirm this by using something like <code>x11vnc</code> after running your own WM in it. Xephyr spawns a new X server inside the preexisting X server, which is not as efficient but a lot easier.</p>

<p>We can however stop everything else related to the native GUI, as we need the extra memory and we can’t use it while LXDE is running anyways:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>SERVICES</span><span>=</span><span>"framework pillow webreader kb contentpackd"</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>stop <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, we need to get the screen size for later:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>eips <span>-i</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>'xres:'</span> | <span>awk</span> <span>'{print $2"x"$4}'</span>
<span>600x800
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s chroot back into the system and see if we can get LXDE to run. Be sure to replace the screen size parameter if needed:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>Xephyr :1 <span>-title</span> <span>"L:A_N:application_ID:xephyr"</span> <span>-screen</span> 600x800 <span>-cc</span> 4 <span>-nocursor</span> &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:1
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>lxsession &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>xrandr <span>-o</span> right
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If everything goes well, you should have LXDE visible on your Kindle’s screen. Ta-da! Feel free to play around with it. I’ve found that the touch screen is suprisingly accurate, even though it is using an IR LED system to detect touches instead of a normal digitizer.</p>

<p>Once done in the chroot, Ctrl-C + Ctrl-D can be issued to exit the chroot. We can then restore the Kindle UI by doing:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>start <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It might take a while for anything to display again.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned setting up a KUAL extension to automate the entering and exiting of the chroot. You can find that <a href="https://github.com/neonsea/karch">here</a>. If you’re interested in using this, make sure you’ve set up your filesystem first and copied it over to the same directory as the extension, and that it’s named <code>arch.img</code>. Everything else is not mandatory - the extension will do it for you.</p>

November 30, 2020 | https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-11-30-dolt-filter-branch/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-11-30-dolt-filter-branch/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p><a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is a tool built for collaboration and data distribution,
a SQL database you can branch, merge, diff, clone, fork, push and pull.
Today, we're announcing support for filter-branch in Dolt.</p>
<p>"Customer focus" is a mantra for our company.
In August, we launched a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-26-discord/">Discord server</a>
to be more available to our users.
It allows us to be more responsive to the Dolt community and get feedback on what their needs are.
Recently, a user requested a method to delete sensitive data from a repository.
Deleting rows or dropping tables isn't sufficient, because the sensitive data will still be reachable from previous commits.
What we need is a way to rewrite history and excise the data from all the commits.
The canonical way to do this in Git is <code>filter-branch</code>.
It provides a way to replay the commit history, applying alterations or "filters" to each revision.</p>
<h2>"Git for Data"</h2>
<p>Open data projects are few and far between; we're hoping that Dolt can provide the infrastructure to change that.
Git helped spark an era of Open Source Software collaboration, and we modeled Dolt after it for that reason.
It's a concrete interface for us to replicate, and it allows our users to transfer their knowledge from Git to Dolt.
Even for those familiar with Git, <code>filter-branch</code> is a more obscure command.
Git's own implementation of <code>filter-branch</code> comes with a huge <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch#_warning">disclaimer</a>.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/07a8e9bf91563b0ae0c170947654d5be/487bb/git-filter-branch-docs.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

    </span></p>
<p>They even recommend a third-party tool <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/"><code>filter-repo</code></a> over their own implementation.
Much of the difficulty in <code>git filter-branch</code> comes from the complexity of manipulating an entire repo at once.
Where Git struggles, Dolt shines.
The power of a relational database is in its strongly-structured schema; it's tailor-made for these manipulations.
Queries can tractably be applied to each commit, and Dolt's branching model can be used to safely backup your data
during the <code>filter-branch</code> operation.</p>
<h2>Rewriting History</h2>
<p>Let's look at an example of removing a table of sensitive data from the repository.
In our repository we have one branch and two tables:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>dolt<span>&gt;</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> dolt_branches<span>;</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>|</span> name   <span>|</span> <span>hash</span>                             <span>|</span> latest_committer <span>|</span> latest_committer_email <span>|</span> latest_commit_date                <span>|</span> latest_commit_message <span>|</span>

<span>+</span>
dolt<span>&gt;</span> <span>show</span> <span>tables</span><span>;</span>

<span>+</span>
<span>|</span> credit_card_info <span>|</span>
<span>|</span> users            <span>|</span>
<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We've decided we want to remove this financial information from our repository.
We'll need to edit the history, so let's inspect what it looks like with the <code>dolt_commits</code> system table: </p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>dolt<span>&gt;</span> <span>SELECT</span> cm<span>.</span>message<span>,</span> cm<span>.</span>commit_hash<span>,</span> anc<span>.</span>parent_hash 
    <span>FROM</span> dolt_commits <span>AS</span> cm 
    <span>JOIN</span> dolt_commit_ancestors <span>AS</span> anc 
    <span>ON</span> cm<span>.</span>commit_hash <span>=</span> anc<span>.</span>commit_hash 
    <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> cm<span>.</span><span>date</span><span>;</span> 
<span>+</span>
<span>|</span> message                    <span>|</span> commit_hash                      <span>|</span> parent_hash                      <span>|</span>

<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's first create a <code>backup</code> branch, and then we can remove the <code>credit_card_info</code> table.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>dolt branch backup HEAD
dolt filter-branch <span>"DROP TABLE credit_card_info;"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>filter-branch</code> starts at a tip of the current branch, follows the commits back to the beginning of the history,
and then replays each commit, modifying it with the provided query.
The replay process forks the history of the current branch, so our <code>backup</code> branch still holds a reference to the
unmodified version of the data until we delete it:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Before:
               c --- d         -- backup
              /       \      /
        0 -- a -- b -- e -- f -- master

After:
               c' --- d'
              /         \
        0 -- a' -- b' -- e' -- f' -- master'
         \  
           -- a -- b -- e -- f -- backup         
               \       /
                c --- d</code></pre></div>
<p>Once we're satisfied with the results, we can complete the removal by deleting our backup branch and
running <code>dolt gc</code>. This will garbage collect all unreferenced data at the storage layer and delete it permanently.  </p>
<h2>SQL and Filter-Branch</h2>
<p>While deleting data is a central use-case for <code>filter-branch</code>, it's capable of much more.
The power and simplicity of SQL means <code>filter-branch</code> is much more powerful in Dolt than it can be in Git.
As an example we're going to modify the <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/noaa">NOAA repository</a>,
a database of weather data sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
This repo has a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-02-noaa-global-hourly-surface-data/">unique structure</a>:
it uses the commit history to model time series data.
Each commit contains a day's worth of hourly measurements;
its parent commit is the previous day and its child commit is the subsequent day.
As a result, each commit's tables are relatively small and fast to query.
The entirety of the data is still accessible at once through the <code>dolt_history</code> tables. </p>
<p>Using <code>filter-branch</code> we can modify and add to this data while maintaining its commit-per-day structure.
If we look closer at the measurement tables, we can see that each row contains summary statistics about the
measurements and metadata about the number of measurements taken at that station on that day. </p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>noaa<span>&gt;</span> <span>select</span> station<span>,</span> data_points <span>from</span> air_temp <span>limit</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<p>Let's create some summary statistics about the number of measurements taken at each station to get a better idea
of how reliably each station is reporting data. First we'll create a table to hold the data, then for each
data table we're interested in, we'll insert a row. <code>filter-branch</code> currently runs one query at a time,
so we'll write a little bash loop for this.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>dolt filter-branch <span>"CREATE TABLE stability (measurement varchar(20) primary key, mean float, total bigint);"</span>
<span>for</span> <span>tbl</span> <span>in</span>  air_temp dew_point_temp sea_level_pressure sky_ceiling_height visibility wind_speed
<span>do</span>
	dolt filter-branch <span>"
        INSERT INTO stability (measurement, mean, total) 
        SELECT '<span>$tbl</span>', avg(data_points), sum(data_points) 
        FROM <span>$tbl</span>;"</span>
<span>done</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When <code>filter-branch</code> is done rewriting the history we can inspect the results:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>noaa<span>&gt;</span> <span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> dolt_history_stability <span>where</span> measurement <span>=</span> <span>'air_temp'</span> <span>limit</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><code>filter-branch</code> is just the latest in a line of cool features that we're adding to Dolt.
We envisioned Dolt as the cross-product of Git and MySQL.
The result might end up being something more powerful than either one.
Our goal is to put the data you're searching for at your fingertips and make it effortless to work with.
If you've got an idea for what you'd like to see in Dolt, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">let us know</a>!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The building did not stand out. Unremarkable industrial building, which was built in hundreds of Soviet cities.<span id="more-10215"></span></p>
<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

        <div>

          

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/app/other/visicalc/1981/"><img alt="VisiCalc" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/visicalc.jpg"></a></p>
</div>
<p>
Spreadsheets attract people with a hacker mindset, since they reward a
little technical curiosity with a big jump in capability. Despite
that, while there are some open source spreadsheet projects, most of
the action is closed source (Excel, Airtable, Honeycode, etc). Grist is a solid,
modern, powerful spreadsheet that fits well into the open-source
ecology, and is as friendly to hacker-developers as it is to
hacker-users. Here are some reasons why.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="Linked sections" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/links.webp"></p>
<p>
Grist borrows visually from classic spreadsheets and modern
dashboards, with every view backed by relational data, filtered and
linked with other views as needed. Grist takes care of the data, and keeping
it live, so custom views are easy to add if you need something new,
using <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#minimal-example">standard HTML/JS/CSS</a>. For example, live-updating
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-08-invoices/">invoices</a>,
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-10-print-labels/">mailing labels</a>,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/iqhzhQM66qg7/Pedigree-Example/m/fork/p/2#a1.s3.r11.c2">goat pedigrees</a>,
 <a href="https://public.getgrist.com/doc/exoplanets/m/fork">exoplanet birthday card</a>,
 or <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/qctFijX9HUZu/Morse-Code/m/fork/p/2">morse code quizzer</a> that look just how you want them.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="datasette" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/datasette.png"></p>
<p>
Grist is a <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document">self-contained format</a>, based on SQLite. Grist tables
are literally SQLite tables, which opens up all sorts of possibilities.
For example, I can take a Grist
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/investment-research">example investment spreadsheet</a>
and publish it using Simon Willison’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">datasette</a>
as a <a href="https://candy-tourmaline-efraasia.glitch.me/data/Investments">Glitch remix</a>
without any conversion steps needed. This is a step up from exporting CSV.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="python formulas" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/spots-left.png"></p>
<p>
Grist uses <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">python as its formula language</a>. Python has a good standard
library, nice syntax for working with lists, and is a favorite of data
scientists. Grist itself is written in TypeScript, with formula
evaluation isolated in a sandbox.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="data diff" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/diff.png"></p>

<p>
The Grist format makes it easy to find the most recent common ancestor
of two versions of a document, facilitating three-way comparisons and
git-style revision control. When working on a Grist spreadsheet with someone,
you can use real-time collaborative editing -
or you may sometimes prefer to
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/copying-docs/#trying-out-changes">“fork” your spreadsheet</a>,
make a set of changes,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/syx4YUwXdDyP/NYC-Bridges?compare=syx4YUwXdDyPELJUEqShA9~o4CKdSVuVQfGbyHCXctpqV~4">compare them with the original</a>
and then land them back.  We’re excited to flesh this workflow
out, and I think any programmer can see where we’re going with it.

<p>
Grist code is available at <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">github.com/gristlabs/grist-core</a>
under a standard free and open source licence (Apache 2.0).
Grist software is developed by Grist Labs, which offers <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/pricing">free and paid
hosting plans</a>. Whether you choose us to host your spreadsheets,
or to run Grist yourself, you have the comfort of knowing the developers have revenue
(so they won’t one day vanish in the morning sun like an elusive gleam of dew on a flower),
and you have the code and your data (ditto).

<div>
<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/"><img alt="spreadsheet jsfiddle" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/fiddle.png"></a></p>
<p>
“Fiddle” sites are very handy for communicating and learning about a
technology. I know I learned a lot about javascript by playing
with this 30-line implemention of a spreadsheet:
<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/">https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/</a>. Grist supports fiddles almost by
accident, because you can <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/">use Grist without logging in</a>,
and you can quickly edit a “fork” of a spreadsheet without changing your original.
Here, try <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/afterschool-program/m/fork">fiddling with one of our examples</a>. You won’t break it.
</p>
</div>

<p>Grist supports <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns">attachments</a>, and those attachments can be downloaded as part of a
single Grist file format.
Grist has solid undo/redo support.
Hosted Grist makes <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/automatic-backups/">automatic backups</a> at hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly intervals.
Grist has <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/rest-api/">an API</a> and a <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/grist/integrations">Zapier integration</a>.
Grist supports real time collaboration.
Grist supports many <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">Excel functions</a>.
We publish a Grist docker image (see the <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core#grist">README</a>),
and have an unreleased standalone app for Windows/Mac/Linux that we’ll be bringing
up to date.
</p>

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322"><img alt="Plimpton 322 tablet" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/Plimpton322.jpg"></a></p>
</div>

<p>
Spreadsheets have evolved a lot since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">Babylonian times</a>.
In open-source, <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org/">Gnumeric</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> are venerable standalone
Excel replacements.
<a href="https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet">LuckySheet</a> is a shot at a clone of that standalone experience in the browser.
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/">Ethercalc</a> is a real-time collaborative spreadsheet, developed by
Audrey Tang, now Taiwan’s Digital Minister, extending work they did with Dan Bricklin on SocialCalc.
Evolving further, hybrid spreadsheet-database models are growing in usefulness and
popularity. That's what Grist is, and we are pleased to bring it now
to the open-source community.
</p>
</div>

<p>Spreadsheets have a long tail of features that are “must haves” for someone out there.
We think a quality, open code base is a big help for realizing those features, and having
peace of mind in relying on them.
Just as Babylonian clay tablets were, we hope that Grist will prove a
sturdy data storage and presentation infrastructure that
can survive for years (if not centuries!) to come.
</p>

<p>Come play with <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/">hosted Grist</a>, or
explore and build <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">Grist
source code</a>. In either case, we'd be grateful for your feedback at

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    <p>In the world we live in, most products compete for the same market: <strong>our attention</strong>.</p>

<p>The usual suspects are facebook, twitter, pinterest, reddit on your phone, netflix, hulu &amp; friends on your other devices.</p>

<p>In the more tolerated category we have personal messaging: imessage, whatsapp &amp; messenger (hey again facebook), and co.</p>

<p>The competition has extended to “workplace productivity” which is sneaky way of saying “social media, but at work”: slack, teams, email.</p>

<p>Companies like slack internally define engagement as minutes spent on slack. Few people would argue that the more minutes they spend on slack, the more successful their day has been. Would you?</p>

<p>None of these companies taken in a vacuum is a big issue, however <strong>together they form a focus absorbing black hole</strong>, 5 minutes of your attention at a time.</p>

<p>These products have become so good at nipping away at our attention, one push notification or red bubble at a time, that there is very little room left for you to be your original self and achieve a state of focus for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>This is a sad state of affairs, but also can be seen as an opportunity! The internet and the tech boom has normalized us humans like nothing ever has. <strong>The new differentiator that matters most is focus</strong>.</p>

<p>How many of us can read a book for 1h or more without checking their phone?</p>

<p>How many of us can produce a deep, original thought?</p>

<p>How many of us can just sit there at a restaurant without whipping the phone out when we are left at a restaurant table alone?</p>

<p><em>A ridiculously small amount.</em></p>

<p>We should pay more attention to this (pardon the pun), and update our behavior.</p>

<p>What are some ways to get back to focus levels that we once achieved? This is a personal question and if you care, I invite you to think about what your answer is.</p>

November 30, 2020 | https://www.abar.tech/articles/dear-finance-this-is-why-cloud-costs-are-complex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.abar.tech/articles/dear-finance-this-is-why-cloud-costs-are-complex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This scenario keeps repeating: Finance get an AWS bill, it’s over budget, rightfully they are surprised and come to the Engineering team asking why. After it has been resolved, they want to address the root cause: can we work together to set better budgets so we can all plan and be prepared. This blog sheds some light on why this is a complex task.</p>
<p><em>Side note: I have to write a blog about why Engineering should also know about Finance - did you know that there can be tax implications when you tag your cloud resources?</em></p>
<h2>Task: How much will it cost to store a 1 GB file in our AWS account?</h2>
<p>First we need to choose which cloud service we would like to use, AWS has “175 fully featured services”. Let’s assume we’d like to use AWS S3 for this use case. Next we need to choose which type of S3 product we’d like to use. There are 6 different types depending on how frequently you need to access the file; and depending on how much storage we already use, there are 14 different price points. The next question is where would you like the file to be hosted? There are 21 AWS regions to choose from (2 more for Government Cloud). So far, we have 14 prices x 21 regions = 294 different price points.</p>
<p>That’s probably enough to demonstrate the complexity of cloud pricing, but lets go a little deeper. Next, we have to think about how many times this file will be accessed; if it will be accessed from within the same region or outside the region; what about doing analysis tasks on the folder containing all the files, and finally what about replication of the data. The total number of price points comes to 2,721.</p>
<p>I have chosen a relatively simple example here. AWS EC2 has 1,716,582 price points, of which 1,611,573 prices are the actual compute instances.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve focused on the price points from AWS S3, but that’s rarely used by itself. It is common to use S3 with a compute service such as AWS Lambda, to process the data, and it’s common to use Lambda with an API Gateway that acts as a “front-door” for applications to access the compute service, CloudWatch for logging, and either RDS or DynamoDB for record keeping. You can see how, at best it’s very time consuming, and at worst pretty much impossible, to give an answer to the question by manually trying to calculate it.</p>
<p>Why do I know the exact pricing point numbers? Because we created price mappings to develop <a href="https://www.infracost.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Infracost.io</a>. Infracost takes Terraform files (Infrastructure as Code), and provides a cost estimate for developers so the cost is better understood <strong>before</strong> launching or changing infrastructure. We believe giving developers and DevOps easy access to pricing information will enable them to make better decisions at design time, ultimately reducing waste in cloud spend.</p>
<p>Infracost does all the complex cost calculations, and leaves a simple comment in your pull request with the cost implications:</p>

<p>Robotti 150D has two Kubota diesel engines. One 75 hp engine is for propulsion and the other 75 hp engine is for the PTO and external hydraulics. Robotti navigates using RTK GPS. In the field it carefully operates according to a plan which the farmer makes using Agrointelli route planning software. The software calculates an optimised route for the field. What makes Robotti unique is that it is in many ways very standard and similar to a tractor. It carries the implement in the centre so that it does not swing and is always stabilised. About a dozen units are currently running in Czech Republic, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and in Denmark.<br><strong>Availability:</strong> In 2021 Robotti will be operating in most European countries. They will be sold, leased or rented. Sales prices start at € 175,000.

<p>AgXeed is launching a track-based agbot autonomous tractor for specialised and standard implements designed for category III rear and category II front hitches. Working widths are up to six metres (depending on the type of implement used) and the track width is up to 3.2 metres. The vehicle is powered by a 156 hp four-cylinder Deutz diesel engine that drives an electric generator to power all actuators (drivetrain, PTO, fan, etc.). Navigation and planning takes place via cloud-based software that automatically generates path planning based on the field’s geofences and machine specifications. The biggest advantage is that the AgXeed AgBot can be used straight from the box. No special implements are required, nor special software on your home computer. AgXeed deliver a ready-to-use ecosystem that avoids compacting the soil by providing very low ground pressure of maximum 0.5 kg/cm².<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Initial sales in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK. The company is currently discussing several purchase models (sale and lease) with distribution parties. The starting price will be around € 249,500 depending on the options selected. The focus right now is on finalising the current design for pre-series production in 2021.<br><strong>Watch video <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/qcYR2XaD0UA" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Solar-battery powered spraying robot Avo is developed for targeted application of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertiliser by camera recognition in row crops, meadows and intercropping cultures. It uses RTK GPS, AI and vision to detect and selectively spray weeds with a micro-dose of herbicide. The centimetre-precise detection and spraying reduces the volume of herbicides used by up to 95%. The most striking detail is the spot spraying technology with up to 24 cm² spray resolution on the ground. There are currently a total of five units active in France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland.<br><strong>Availability:</strong> In 2021 Avo will be tested further and 15 zero series models will follow in 2022 costing around € 90,000. Ecorobotix plans to have another robot on sale in the spring of 2021 but doesn’t want to reveal any details yet.<br><strong>Watch videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vvQqqc1zHM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSpAceUhLXw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The solar battery-powered FarmDroid FD20 performs fully automatic seeding and weeding of various crops between rows and in the row (intra-row). From the seeding process the FD20 knows the position of every seed and therefore knows where it subsequently must weed and, just as importantly, where not to weed. The farmer sets the corner points of the field, creating a geofence for the robot to work within. After setting the number of headlands passes and the direction of the rows, the robot runs on RTK GPS from a base station. The robot does not rely on cameras and never needs charging. Over 100 FD20 robots are active in Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland and they have handled over 1,500 ha of sugar beet, onions, green kale, flowers, spinach, canola and beetroot.<br><strong>Availability:</strong> In 2021 it will also be available in France, Italy, Lithuania and Spain. Currently, dedicated implements and tools are being developed for the FD20.<br><strong>Watch video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqguf1J-38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Flutter and React Native are the two most popular cross-platform native development frameworks out there. Many articles have been written comparing the two, but <em>none</em> of them can answer the most important question:</p><p>Which is right for <strong>you</strong>?</p><p>In <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/how-to-make-better-technology-decisions">How to make better technology decisions</a>, you can find details of the evaluation method I am using for this analysis. In short, we are following a 3 step process:</p><ol><li>Identify <strong>options</strong></li><li>Identify and weight <strong>criteria</strong></li><li><strong>Score</strong> each option</li></ol><p>To facilitate this Flutter vs. React Native analysis, I am using the <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/help-me-decide">Help Me Decide</a> tool, which you should check out if you are not familiar with it.</p><p>This analysis documents my findings from researching and prototyping with Flutter and React Native over approximately a 1 month period. If you are also deciding between these two options, I encourage you to <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/how-to-make-better-technology-decisions">learn the process</a> and make your own informed decision.</p><h2 id="context-and-bias">Context and bias<a href="#context-and-bias">#</a></h2><p>Before we begin, one thing missing from most articles comparing Flutter and React Native is transparency around the author's <strong>context and bias</strong>. Without knowing these, you can easily be led astray, thinking because a few people made a choice, you should make the same choice. <strong>I am not here to decide for you</strong>, nor should you let anyone else make your decision. I am here to walk you through my process and give you the tools so you can make your own decision.</p><p><strong>Context</strong> describes the circumstances surrounding your evaluation. Are you performing this evaluation on behalf of a team or organization? What do your stakeholders care about? What technology is the team already familiar with? Are there specific requirements that apply to you that may not apply to others?</p><p><strong>Bias</strong> describes presupposed favor or disfavor toward an option. Do you already have an opinion? Have you already worked with one of the options? Did somebody tell you they "heard bad things" about one of them at a conference they attended two years ago?</p><p>The <strong>context</strong> for my evaluation of Flutter vs. React Native is that I am tasked by my employer with researching both frameworks and making a recommendation for our company, a small-medium startup that currently employs 4 native Android/iOS developers and 8 web developers. My stakeholders have a few loosely defined goals. One is to accelerate development of our primary mobile application, which is currently implemented in both Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS). Another is to optimize the team size (and therefore cost) required to build and maintain mobile applications. Finally, we aim to achieve "resource fungibility," an awkward term that we will dive into further later.</p><p>As for my <strong>bias</strong>, I am a web developer with over a decade of both full stack and web development experience, more recently focused on React for about 5 years and almost no professional native development experience. I began this evaluation with a considerable bias toward React Native, given my comfort and experience with React. That said, I still remember when <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb sunsetted React Native</a> and a few other industry stories about React Native, so I am aware that organizations have experienced mixed results. I also have some personal skepticism with Google's ability to properly build and maintain a solid open source development framework and keep it alive for the duration I need it (hint: I did some Angular.js development and am <em>not</em> a fan of the latest version of Angular).</p><div><h3>Check yourself</h3><p>Keep your evaluation as objective as possible by paying attention to your bias and the bias of others.</p></div><p>Okay, enough about my context and my bias. Be sure to spend a few minutes writing down these points for yourself. The best way to keep your evaluation as objective as possible is to be aware of your biases.</p><h2 id="flutter-vs-react-native-criteria">Flutter vs. React Native criteria<a href="#flutter-vs-react-native-criteria">#</a></h2><p>Before we can evaluate Flutter and React Native we need to establish <strong>criteria</strong>, the principles and standards by which we may judge and decide.</p><p>Here is my list of criteria:</p><ul><li>Built-in Capabilities</li><li>Learning Curve</li><li>Resource Fungibility</li><li>Integration Support</li><li>Developer Experience</li><li>Performance</li><li>Community Support</li><li>Future Prospects</li></ul><p>Each criteria also needs a <strong>weight</strong>, a 1 to 5 rating that designates the level of importance for each criterion where 1 is the lowest importance and 5 is the highest.</p><h3 id="built-in-capabilities">Built-in Capabilities<a href="#built-in-capabilities">#</a></h3><p><strong>Weight: 5/5</strong></p><p><em><strong>Weight represents importance</strong></em> on a 1-5 scale where 1 is the least important criteria and 5 is the most important. If you are still not quite sure how the weights are being used, you can sneak a peak at the <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/help-me-decide?s=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">final scores</a>.</p><p>This category covers the amount and quality of capabilities that are built into the framework itself.</p><p>I am ranking this criterion highly for a few reasons.</p><p>First, the more that is built into the framework, the <strong>faster</strong> our team can get started on any project and the less time we need to spend on <strong>maintenance</strong>.</p><p>Second, <strong>decision fatigue</strong> is real in the JavaScript/React community and it's been a real problem for me in my 5 years of React experience. It is good to have some choices, but I prefer to minimize the number of decisions that we need to make to get up and running.</p><p>Third, missing capabilities often require us to reach for a community solution. We do this all the time in web development, and it comes with significant risk as <strong>many community solutions do not stand the test of time</strong>. Even with well-maintained packages, there is <strong>significant overhead</strong> to staying on top of those ever-evolving dependencies (said Dependabot maintainers everywhere). Last, the more that is built into the framework, the more consistent applications are both within an organization and in the ecosystem itself. Consistency within an organization is beneficial for many reasons, and it is notoriously difficult when many teams are simultaneously solving their own problems and not necessarily checking in to see if others have already solved similar problems. Consistency across the ecosystem is beneficial too. Almost every tutorial or Stack Overflow question dealing with React has <em>something</em> that is inconsistent with the stack I am working in, whether it's using inline styles where we use Emotion, or they are using React Router where I am using the Next.js router, and so on.</p><p>Last, built-in capabilities lower the barrier to getting started with a proof of concept (POC). POCs need to be expendable so you want to minimize any up front investment. A framework with more built-in capabilities will accelerate your ability to go from nothing to a working POC in short time.</p><p>When it comes to built-in capabilities, I broke this up into 3 categories: components, navigation, and testing.</p><h4 id="components">Components<a href="#components">#</a></h4><p>Flutter provides a full <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Widget catalog</a> that includes the basic building blocks like text, buttons, containers, drawers, inputs, etc. This widget catalog also has built-in support for animation and motion, painting effects and layouts.</p><p>React Native provides a much smaller set of very basic built-in components. Looking for a community solution, I searched for something equivalent to <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material-UI</a>, which I have used in many web applications, but had a difficult time finding something even close to the comprehensive suite of components you get with Material UI. I found <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-native-paper</a> and <a href="https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-native-elements</a> and found them a bit underwhelming in both volume of components and customization flexibility. There may be better component libraries out there, but the fact that you need to find one in the community or create your own is a problem.</p><p>As a web developer, I have worked with many component libraries like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Material UI, and fully custom design systems and I can say with certainty that I am fatigued from the industry thrashing and fragmentation in this category. Components are such a core part of frontend development that variance just in the component library you choose leads to variance in the entire application. And if you happen to choose a library that falls into obsolescence (looking at you, Semantic UI), you either carry the weight of abandonware or are forced to rewrite. While I don't think it is <em>difficult</em> to write custom components, it <strong>takes time</strong> that my stakeholders would rather be spent on building a product and iterating in market with real users.</p><h4 id="navigation">Navigation<a href="#navigation">#</a></h4><p>With React Native, you must choose between <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation#react-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Navigation</a> or <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native Navigation</a> (and there are even other options out there). As of this writing, React Navigation seems to be the more popular choice, but the choice depends on your needs. If you need a native implementation, you may need to consider React Native Navigation.</p><p>As with widgets, Flutter comes with <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in Navigation utilities</a> along with documented recipes demonstrating the most common use cases.</p><p>Navigation is such a fundamental need in any application, it is somewhat disappointing to me that React Native does not have a strong built-in solution. This is sort of the approach that React has generally taken for a long time where it is a powerful view layer, but everything else needs to be implemented by you or the community.</p><h4 id="testing">Testing<a href="#testing">#</a></h4><p>Flutter's SDK has an official <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flutter_test library</a> that allows you to implement <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unit tests</a> and <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widget tests</a>. The <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_driver/flutter_driver-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flutter_driver library</a>, also shipped with the Flutter SDK, further allows you to implement full integration tests.</p><p>React Native's default template ships with <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jest</a> and is often paired with <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native Testing Library</a>. As a React web developer, I am both familiar and pleased with Jest and the <code>@testing-library</code> suite. For end-to-end testing, there is a bit more variance as the React Native docs list <a href="https://github.com/wix/detox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detox</a> and <a href="http://appium.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appium</a> as viable options but provide little guidance on how to use them.</p><div><h3>Built-in Capabilities Scores</h3><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Flutter has a more complete core, reducing the need for our team to fill in the gaps with our own solutions or solutions from the community.</p></div><h3 id="learning-curve">Learning Curve<a href="#learning-curve">#</a></h3><p><strong>Weight: 2/5</strong></p><p>The learning curve of a new technology involves the upfront investment required for a developer to achieve a desirable level of productivity.</p><p>When it comes to learning curve, there are a few key questions to ask:</p><ul><li>How much time will it take to <strong>onboard the current team</strong>…</li></ul></div></div>

that provides a unique view of your files by removing the
hierarchy constraints typically imposed on files and folders. In other words, it allows you to think about your
files not as objects <em>stored</em> in folders, but as objects that can be <em>filtered</em> by folders.</p>
<p>Below, the file path <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the <a href="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/glossary.html#term-intersection"><span>intersection</span></a> of all of the files that have been tagged with the
tags <code><span>A</span></code>, <code><span>B</span></code>, and <code><span>C</span></code>. Notice that the resulting files do not live <em>inside</em> of the full path,
they simply appear there because they’ve been tagged with each part of the file path.

These people are losing their bank accounts now and we need a solution,’ VVD parliamentarian Helma Lodders told the paper.</p><p>The banks are threatening to close the accounts of people with American nationality, unless they can furnish them with a US tax number. But there are thousands of Dutch nationals in the <a href="https://accidentalamericans.nl/">Netherlands with American nationality</a> who do not have a tax number because they have never lived in the country and may not even have realised they are also American.</p><p>The legislation, known as FATCA – Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act – requires all US citizens to supply the government with information about any assets they hold abroad, including bank accounts, houses and more. It also requires non-US banks with American clients to furnish the IRS with information about those holdings.</p><p>In the Netherlands some 20,000 people are thought to fall into the accidental American category.</p><p>A spokesman for the Dutch banking association said that people caught in the FATCA trap have had several years to sort out their individual situations. ‘Many Dutch banks which do business in the US cannot ignore their rules,’ the spokesman told the NRC.</p><p><strong>Europe</strong></p><p>Hoekstra told MPs ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that the banks have agreed not to close the accounts of people who have started dealing with the red tape. In addition, the EU is preparing a letter to the US authorities calling for talks on the issue at an EU level, he said.</p><p>Earlier this year, DutchNews.nl reported that <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/04/accidental-americans-hit-by-us-consulate-corona-closure/">consulate closures</a> were causing long delays for people who were trying to sort out their paperwork.</p><p>The only other way open to Dutch Americans is to renounce their American nationality. This, however, comes at a prohibitive cost to many– the fee went up from $450 to $2,350 in 2014. They also have to prove they have paid US taxes for the past five years.</p><div onclick="window.location.href='https://www.dutchnews.nl/donate-to-dutchnews-nl/'"><div><h4>Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl</h4><p>The DutchNews.nl team would like to thank all the generous readers who have made a donation in recent weeks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <blockquote> <p>This is an article in a multi-part series called <a href="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/adventures-in-ruby">“Peter’s Adventures in Ruby”</a></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>It is strongly recommended that you read my <a href="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/creating-ruby-strings-c">article on the ways to create Ruby strings in C extensions</a> if you’re not familiar with Ruby’s C string API</p> </blockquote> <p>Here’s a story of string corruption in MRI when the wrong function is used to create the Ruby string. But before that, let me explain a few Ruby features that you may not know.</p>  <h2 id="editing-a-file-in-place"> Editing a file in place <a href="#editing-a-file-in-place"></a> </h2> <p>Consider the following script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>gets</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we run:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-i</span> script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>As you can see, with the <code>-i</code> flag we can read the text file line-by-line through <code>gets</code>, and replace that line with whatever is in the standard output (the <code>puts</code>).</p> <h2 id="backup-files"> Backup files <a href="#backup-files"></a> </h2> <p>Let’s run the script above again, but instead of the <code>-i</code> we pass to Ruby, let’s pass <code>-i.bak</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-i</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>All this does is create a backup file (with the extension <code>.bak</code> in our case) with the original contents before modifying it.</p> <h2 id="run-the-ruby-script-line-by-line"> Run the Ruby script line-by-line <a href="#run-the-ruby-script-line-by-line"></a> </h2> <p>Did you know we can do the above, but with a single line of Ruby code? Consider the following Ruby script:</p>  <p>And then we run it as the following (notice we are running the script with an extra <code>-p</code> flag):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-pi</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>-p</code> flag conviniently wraps your code around an implicit <code>while gets(); ...; puts $_; end</code>.</p> <h2 id="begin-blocks"> <code>BEGIN</code> blocks <a href="#begin-blocks"></a> </h2> <p>One question you might ask yourself is, if I use the <code>-p</code> flag, how do I do global setup? Ruby’s got a feature for that! Enter <code>BEGIN</code> blocks.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: Ruby’s keywords are case sensitive, so <code>BEGIN</code> is not the same as <code>begin</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So now, if we do:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"It is starting!"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we can run it as follows:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-pi</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt
It is starting!

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Notice we get the <code>It is starting!</code> output in the terminal, and not in the file.</p> <h2 id="shebang"> Shebang <a href="#shebang"></a> </h2> <p>We want to minimize the number of characters we have to type. So we can omit the flags from the terminal and instead include it in the file using a shebang line.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/ruby -pi.bak</span>

<span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"It is starting!"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we can run it as follows:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby script.rb temp.txt
It is starting!

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In fact, Ruby doesn’t actually check that the binary in the shebang is valid, just that it ends in <code>ruby</code>. So the following shebang would have worked too:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/some/invalid/dir/ruby -pi.bak</span>
</code></pre></div></div>  <p>Ok, we finally have everything we need to reproduce the bug. Consider the following script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/ruby -pi.bak</span>

<span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>full_mark: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>arr</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
  <span>1000000</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span>
    <span>arr</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"fooo</span><span>#{</span><span>x</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>So what do we expect it to do? Well, this is pretty much the same script as the one in example #5 (while doing some seemingly useless work in the <code>BEGIN</code> block).</p> <p>So let’s run this script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
<span>cat</span>: temp.txt.bak: No such file or directory

<span>$ </span><span>ls
</span>script.rb
temp.txt
temp.txto106
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Wait what!?!? Where is our backup file <code>temp.txt.bak</code>? And what is <code>temp.txto106</code>? Let’s inspect these files.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txto106
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It seems like <code>temp.txto106</code> contains the original file (the one that should have been the backup file). So what’s going on? You might have guessed it, because the wrong C function was used to create Ruby strings!</p> <h2 id="so-whats-wrong"> So, what’s wrong? <a href="#so-whats-wrong"></a> </h2> <p>When you pass the flag <code>-i.bak</code> to Ruby, it parses the arguments in your shebang from a Ruby string read from the contents of the Ruby script<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. We then set the extension of the backup file by calling <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/66efe373116d510c05d57964b5ffa47f1c6e565c/io.c#L12989"><code>ruby_set_inplace_mode</code></a>. This function is really simple, it’s defined like this.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span>
<span>ruby_set_inplace_mode</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>suffix</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>ARGF</span><span>.</span><span>inplace</span> <span>=</span> <span>!</span><span>suffix</span> <span>?</span> <span>Qfalse</span> <span>:</span> <span>!*</span><span>suffix</span> <span>?</span> <span>Qnil</span> <span>:</span> <span>rb_fstring_cstr</span><span>(</span><span>suffix</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The problem here is the usage of <code>rb_fstring_cstr</code>, which (similar to <code>rb_str_new_static</code>) expects a pointer to a region of memory that is not <code>free</code>‘d before this Ruby string is swept (because it sets the pointer of the Ruby string directly to the string passed in).</p> <p>To explain using diagrams (don’t we all love diagrams?), we have a Ruby string of the flags in the shebang stored in <code>argv</code>. We then call <code>ruby_set_inplace_mode</code> and set <code>ARGF.inplace</code> to a Ruby string that points to <code>.bak</code>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug1.png" height="300"> </figure> <p>But then when we no longer need <code>argv</code>, but <code>ARGF.inplace</code> is still pointing to the string that <code>argv</code> was referencing.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug2.png" height="300"> </figure> <p>So then we call <code>GC.start</code> which guarantees that <code>argv</code> is swept, and then we create a large amount of <code>fooo#{x}</code> strings. This helps us make sure the string <code>-pi.bak</code> is overwritten and so we get <code>ARGF.inplace</code> pointing to some other value. So then once the script terminates, the backup extension we use is <code>o106</code> (or some other gibberish).</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug3.png" height="300"> </figure> <h2 id="the-fix"> The fix <a href="#the-fix"></a> </h2> <p>The fix only changes one line and a few characters!<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> The solution is instead of calling <code>rb_fstring_cstr</code> to create the string, we use <code>rb_str_new</code>, which allocates memory for the string and copies over the contents of the string. Once we do that, we no longer need to ensure that the original string is not <code>free</code>‘d.</p> <h2 id="acknowledgements"> Acknowledgements <a href="#acknowledgements"></a> </h2> <p>I would like to acknowledge <a href="https://www.eightbitraptor.com/">Matt Valentine-House</a> as the co-discoverer of the bug and the co-author of the fix.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

      <div><p>«Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</p><p>mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,</p><p>ché la diritta via era smarrita.»</p><p>«Midway upon the journey of our life</p><p>I found myself within a forest dark,</p><p>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.»</p></div><p>-&nbsp;<span>Dante Alighieri</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-831a4fb5-7fff-d639-36d7-57d1a4f7bed9"><p><span>I've rediscovered some long forgotten joys since I signed up for SpaceHey yesterday, and even if my mind and thoughts are undoubtedly clouded by nostalgia and a longing for simpler times, certain ideas sprang up in my mind, and I think there is truth to them. I'd like to share these with you, hoping that together we can plant even more new seeds and promote healthier growth in our online communities.</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest takeaways is the difference when compared to the passive consumption on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (or basically any other social network out there at the moment). Here I am not presented with an infinite amount of content for me to scroll through, I actively have to seek it out. In doing that my relationship with the network and the content available throughout it changes from a <i>reactive</i> one to a <i>proactive</i> one. It becomes an experience more similar to browsing wikipedia for example, guided by curiosity and a genuine sense of exploration. I haven't been able to find the right words so far to explain it in writing, but experiencing it first-hand is a visceral feeling where the contrast between the two approaches is instantly felt, one feels empty and passive, the other engaging and exciting.</span></p><p><span>Adding the like button may have boosted engagement, MAUs (Monthly Active Users), profits and so much else. Algorithms that choose what content to show us did the same. Having tried SpaceHey which lacks these features, what's painfully obvious is that we didn't ask for them, they (and others) were imposed on us to promote the growth of these platforms while disregarding our real needs. They may have boosted some internal metrics and to some extent were justified as a "nice" thing for users, but because of their "success", these "features" were doubled-down on, optimized further and eventually led us to the AI-driven, mostly passive-consumerism, infinity pools that social networks are today.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, standardization (across the board) led to successes, many principally of business value, for the big companies dominating the space. It inevitably led to a loss of individuality however, a digital communism if you will. Users were forced to express themselves in pre-approved formats, that gradually got more and more standardized and limited to the point where today you can't even make the text in your Facebook posts bold (you can choose from a predefined set of stickers though!). To what end has it been? Moderation is as hot of a topic as it ever was, with no definitive solution in sight, in the meantime we jump on every new app that let us express ourselves more, only to fall victim to the all powerful algorithms that ultimately decide which content actually reaches people.</span></p><p><span>There's been a trend in the last few years of longing for the "old internet", places like Yahoo! GeoCities, personal blogs and yes, Myspace profiles, where individuals, rather than big organized groups, were the producers of content. Places where somebody with minimal technical knowledge could put pencil to paper and create something unique that reflected who they were, and where others were actually inclined to discover their creations. Nowadays everything is (or isn't) found through an algorithm (whether the almighty Google Search or a social network's own ranking algorithm) and the services that allowed this kind of content to be created in the first place have either shut down or followed the money and moved on.</span></p><p><span>SpaceHey seems to bring back what made those original services special, introducing both an instrument through which pages can be created and a vibrant platform that allows their discovery.

There is an incredible sense of empowerment and liberty in this approach. I can see this as a place where I can connect with people, a starting point when it comes to connecting with the world at large, a place I can call home knowing full well that I will have to leave in order to explore, since after all, there is no endless wall to scroll through.</span></p><p><span>A massive <b>thank you</b> to </span><span><a href="https://spacehey.com/an">An</a> who, by bringing us back to simpler roots showed in such a powerful way how far we have strayed.

<p>After all, modern life can be stressful and quite frankly overwhelming sometimes. Being constantly connected, trying to multitask, and striving for better on a daily basis can be draining and affect our mental well-being.</p>
<p>In that context, journaling can be a powerful way to relieve some of this anxiety and stress and help us thrive. As a testament to this, some of the greatest minds of this world, such as Albert Einstein or Thomas Edison, have spent hours journaling, keeping track of their knowledge, achievements, dreams, and goals.</p>
<p>Do you want to know how journaling can help you be more productive, happier, or more relaxed?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explain what journaling is before highlighting the key benefits of keeping a journal. We’ll also deep-dive into some of the best journaling techniques before explaining how to start journaling. All you need to do is sit back, relax and enjoy the read ;)</p>
<h2>What is journaling?</h2>
<p>Journaling is the practice of writing your thoughts, emotions, or goals in a journal or diary on a regular basis. It’s also a way to connect with yourself, express your emotions, track your everyday life, your feelings, your dreams, your fears, and experiences. This self-care technique has been <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">shown</a> to help strengthen mental well-being and boost the immune system and has therefore enjoyed increased popularity over the last decade.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Journaling</h2>
<h3>Help Manage Your Stress</h3>
<p>Journaling can be a powerful therapeutic outlet to help relieve stress. Indeed, by expressing yourself on paper, writing down your fears, worries, and even recording negative experiences you’re facing at work or in your personal life, journaling can be cathartic. It can provide a safe and private space where you can freely express negative thoughts or repressed emotions you don’t feel you can share with anyone, allowing for emotional cleansing.
As a result, writing about stressful experiences can be an effective stress management tool that can help reduce stress and its impact on your emotional and physical health.</p>
<h3>Boost Your Memory</h3>
<p>A study published by the <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/xge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Journal of Experimental Psychology</a> revealed that writing is an excellent way to boost your working memory. Indeed, the same way athletes need to train to stay in good shape, the study showed that your brain needs to keep active and engaged in order to stay sharp. Some of the key factors contributing to the improvement of your working memory when writing regularly include focusing on a single task without distraction, thinking of ways to describe events, and recalling descriptive words.</p>
<h3>Help You Fight Depression</h3>
<p>Journaling can be a great way to help you work through depression, navigate what’s happening in your life, and ultimately heal.</p>
<p>The reality is, the more you know about your depression, the better you can manage it. By helping you track your triggers and identify regular thoughts, patterns, and behaviors, journaling can help you better understand where your sadness comes from and define a plan to control it better.</p>
<p>Journaling also gives you an opportunity for some positive self-talk and acts as a reminder of your biggest achievements and your best memories.</p>
<p>By identifying your happiest moments and helping control your emotional triggers, writing can help also improve your mood.</p>
<h3>Help You Achieve Your Goals</h3>
<p>A journal is an excellent goal tracking tool. Indeed, by writing down clearly defined goals and recording the steps you’re taking in order to achieve them, a journal can help you fulfill your wildest dreams and aspirations. As a testament to this, a study led by the Dominican University in California even found that people are 42% more likely to reach their goals if they write them down. The reason is simple; writing down your goals can help declutter your mind, give you clarity, and help you create a vision for your future, ensuring your daily habits align with your priorities.</p>
<h3>Enhance Your Creativity</h3>
<p>Creative journaling is a very efficient way to boost your creativity. Your journal is your secret garden. Indeed, no one else has access to it, and nobody else will ever see or read what is in your journal. This helps relieve any kind of societal pressure and paves the way for your imagination to grow and your incredible ideas to flow unhampered.
Besides, not only can you write down your wildest dreams in a journal without fear of being judged, but you can also use your journal as a way to relax and free your mind from the daily draining clutter and noise, allowing your best ideas to mature and come to fruition.</p>
<h2>Best Journaling Techniques</h2>
<h3>Bullet Journaling</h3>
<p>A bullet journal can be used as an organization tool to keep track of your goals, daily achievements, write your to-do lists, or brainstorm ideas. It can also be used as a reminder tool. A bullet journal provides you with a one-stop-shop for all your ideas and allows you to plan, organize, and track your entire life in one consolidated place. The great thing about a bullet journal is that it can be adjusted at any time to fit your needs.</p>
<p>If you like structure and keep organized by listing things, a bullet journal might be a great tool for you.</p>
<p><strong>How to use a bullet journal?</strong>
You can either buy a pre-made bullet journal or create your own. Based on Caroll’s method, your bullet journal should feature an index, along with future, monthly, and daily logs allowing you to plan and track tasks, meetings, appointments or events, and add reminders. The tasks should be represented by a dot bullet, events by a circle bullet, and notes by a dash bullet. Priority tasks should also be highlighted using an asterisk, and completed tasks will be represented by an x. This way, you’ll get a birds-eye view of all the things you need to do this month and be able to adjust as you go.</p>
<h3>Freewriting</h3>
<p>Freewriting is a journaling technique that allows you to write about anything, for a set period of time without having to worry about grammar or self-editing. It was popularized by <a href="https://nataliegoldberg.com/books/writing-down-the-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nathalie Goldberg</a> and encourages writers to take a leap of faith, freely write their thoughts, emotions, and let their creative juices flow. This technique is a powerful way to help content creators and academics boost their creativity while brainstorming ideas.</p>
<p><strong>How to freewrite?</strong>
The most important thing to do when you freewrite is to forget about language rules. Clear your mind, set a timer (ideally between 10 and 20 minutes), and write. Keep writing without ever stopping regardless of the grammatical mistakes or typos until the time limit is over. It’s important to write even if you think it’s stupid or useless, as this is the only way to unleash your creativity with this journaling technique. From this disorganized, seemingly meaningless writing, something powerful will emerge that you can use in your academic or official writings, even if it takes a few freewriting sessions.</p>
<h3>Art Journaling</h3>
<p>If you want to explore fun ways to express yourself, your thoughts, or your emotions, an art journal might be a fantastic tool for you! Whether you use drawings, paintings, sketches, doodles, collages, or a mix of these and writing, keeping an art journal can be an efficient way to help you channel your emotions. It can also help you express your dreams, relax, plan, and organize your life, boost your creativity, or reduce your stress.</p>
<p><strong>How to use an art journal?</strong>
With art journaling, there aren’t any specific rules. The idea is for you to have fun with it. Gather supplies such as paint, gel pens, scissors, markers, and old magazines and start creating ;)</p>
<h3>Unsent Letters</h3>
<p>If you need to process your feelings regarding a particular person, the unsent letter journaling technique could prove helpful. The idea is to put your emotions into words on a piece of paper, from anger and frustration to admiration or love. Sometimes writing down your feelings towards someone addressing them directly in your writing can help you navigate and channel your emotions and process them. As a result, this widely used technique can help you get closure, collect your thoughts, release repressed emotions, and even give you more clarity about specific feelings.</p>
<p><strong>How to write unsent letters?</strong>
When writing an unsent letter, make sure you’re completely honest and genuine and don’t repress from writing down your true feelings. Make sure you freely express your anger, frustration, sadness, or disappointment. Nobody will ever receive or read this letter, so unleash all of your thoughts. Also, unsent letters can be written to anyone or anything, so there is no limit as to who or what you can write a letter to. You can also start your letter with a prompt such as ‘’ What I need to tell you is’’ or ‘’What I don’t like about you is’’ to help you get started.</p>
<p>There are many other powerful journaling techniques, such as dream journaling, writing a reflective journal, or morning pages.</p>
<h2>How to Start Journaling</h2>
<p>Your journaling process should be unique to you. Don’t try and create a perfectly organized journal, instead strive for genuine self-expression and authenticity. To help you get started, we’ve listed below a few tips to follow:</p>
<div>
    <h3>Pick your journaling tool</h3>
    <p>It can be a notebook, a password-protected WordPress website, or an app. Some of the best journaling apps include Day One, Journey, and Grid Diary. Note that, while journaling apps all have different features, strengths, and weaknesses, Day One is regularly touted as the best journal app.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Write a little every day</h3>
    <p>Pick a time of the day where you can allocate ten or fifteen minutes to writing and make it a habit. Consistency is key if you want to make the most out of your journaling practice.</p>

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>
  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  

<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>






  


  <a-ad height="250" instant="" layout="responsive" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)" preload-distance="200" safeframe="" sizes="300x50,300x75,300x100,300x150,300x250,320x50,320x75,320x100,320x250,fluid" targeting="{&quot;kw&quot;:[&quot;E-Mail&quot;,&quot;E-Mail-Provider&quot;,&quot;Gerichtsurteil&quot;,&quot;LKA&quot;,&quot;Tutanota&quot;,&quot;VerschlÃ¼sselung&quot;,&quot;Ãœberwachung&quot;],&quot;mpos&quot;:[&quot;2&quot;],&quot;themenhub&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}" type="gpt" unit="/6514/www.heise.de/ct/ct-inhalt" width="300"></a-ad>



<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/66ug5i9bkhrghef/screencap_coffeegrindsize.mov?raw=1"></video><figcaption>This is an example of how to use the coffee grind size application.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you do reverse engineering for a living?
Have you ever wasted several weeks reversing an open source library embedded in a target?
Do you crave for better tools than copy-pasting random strings into Google?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Well, read anyway.</p>
<p>-- <em>babush</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we are proud of showing the world the first prototype of <strong>Big Match</strong>, our tool to find open-source libraries in binaries <strong>only using their strings</strong>.
How does it work?
Read this post to find out, or head to <a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><strong>our demo website</strong></a> to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/homepage.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> we are analyzing all the repositories on GitHub and building a search engine on top of that data.</p>

          
          
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There's a thing that every good reverser does when starting to work on a target: look for interesting strings and throw them into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><strong>Google</strong></a> hoping to find some open-source or leaked source.
This can save you anywhere from few hours of work to several days.
It's kind of a poor man's function (or library) matching.</p>
<p>In 2018, I decided to try out <strong><a href="https://line.me/en/">LINE</a>'s Bug Bounty</strong> program and so I started reversing a library bundled with the Android version of the App.
For those unfamiliar with LINE, it's the most used instant messaging App in Japan.
Anyway, there were many useful error strings sprinkled all around my target, so I did exactly that manual googling I've just mentioned.
Luckily, I was able to match some strings against Cisco's <a href="https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp"><code>libsrtp</code></a>.
But little did I know, my target included a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject"><code>PJSIP</code></a>, a <strong>huge</strong> library that does indeed include <code>libsrtp</code>.
Unfortunately, I discovered this fact much later, so I wasted an entire week reversing an open-source library.</p>
<p>So, I thought: <em>"can we do better than manual googling? Why hasn't anyone built a huge database of all the strings in every public repository?"</em>.
And, just like that, the main idea for <strong>Big Match</strong> was born.</p>
<h2>Outline of our approach</h2>
<p>The way we, at rev.ng, decided to approach this problem is actually simple conceptually, but gets tricky due to the scale of the data we are dealing with.</p>
<p>In short, this is the outline of what we did:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Get the source code of the top C/C++ repositories on GitHub</strong>, where <em>"top"</em> means <em>"most starred"</em>. Ideally we would like to analyze all of them, and we will eventually, but we wanted to give priority to famous projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Deduplicate the repositories:</strong> we don't want to have 70k+ slightly different versions of the Linux kernel in our database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extract the strings</strong>: use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> as a quick way to extract strings from source code.</li>
<li>
<strong>De-escape</strong> the strings. E.g.: turn <code>'\n'</code> into an actual newline character.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hash</strong> the strings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Store them</strong> in some kind of database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Query</strong> the database using the hashes of the strings from a target binary.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cluster</strong> the query results.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>The first thing we did was figure out a way to <strong>get the list of all the repos on GitHub</strong>, sorted by stars.
It turns out, however, that this is more easily said than done.
GitHub has an official API but it is rate-limited and we wanted to avoid writing a multi-machine crawling system just for that.
So we looked around and, among many projects making available GitHub data, we found the amazing <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/"><strong>GHTorrent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>GHTorrent, short for <em>GitHub Torrent</em>, is a project created by Prof. Georgios Gousios of TU Delft.
What it does is periodically poll GitHub's <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-public-events">public events API</a> and use the information on commits and new repositories to record the history of GitHub.
So, for example, if user <code>thebabush</code> pushes some changes to his repository <code>awesome-repo</code>, GHTorrent analyzes those changes and, if the repo is not present in its database, it creates a new entry.
It also saves its metadata, e.g. star count, and some of its commits.
By exploiting the GitHub REST API, GHTorrent is able to create a somewhat complete <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/relational.html">relational view</a> of all of GitHub (except for the actual source code):</p>
<p><a href="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"></a></p>
<p>GHTorrent's data is made available as either a MySQL dump of the relational database in the picture or as a series of daily MongoDB dumps.
GHTorrent uses Mongo as a caching layer for GitHub's API so that it can avoid making the same API call twice.</p>
<p>Once you import the GHTorrent MySQL dumps on your machine, you can quickly get useful information about GitHub using good ol' SQL (e.g.: information about the most popular C/C++ repos is a simple <code>SELECT ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ...</code>).
It also contains information about forks and commits, so you have some good data to exploit for the repo deduplication we want to do.</p>
<p>However, <strong>GHTorrent is best-effort by design</strong>, so you'll never have a complete and consistent snapshot of GitHub.
For example, some repos might be missing or have outdated metadata.
Another example is that commits information is partial: GHTorrent cannot possibly associate every commit to every repository containing it.
Think about the Linux kernel: one commit would need to be added to 70k+ forks and that kind of things doesn't scale very well.</p>
<p>Finally, there's another risk regarding the use of a project like GHTorrent: <strong>maintenance</strong>.
Keeping a crawler working costs money and time, and it seems like in the last couple of years <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mysql/">they haven't been releasing MySQL dumps that often anymore</a>.
On the other hand, they still release their <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mongo-daily/">incremental Mongo updates daily</a>.
Since they create the MySQL DB using REST API calls that are cached through MongoDB, those incremental updates should be everything you need to recreate their MySQL database.</p>
<p>A fun fact is that <strong>Microsoft used to sponsor GHTorrent</strong>, but I guess <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">they don't need to do it now</a> 🙃.
And yes, that's not a good thing for us.</p>
<p>In the end, since we don't actually need all the tables provided by the GHTorrent MySQL dump, we decided to write a script that directly consumes their Mongo dumps one by one and outputs the information we need into a bunch of text files.
In fact, <strong>most of our pipeline is implemented using bash scripts</strong> (you can read more in our future blogpost about what we like to call <strong><em>bashML</em></strong>).</p>
<h2>Repository deduplication</h2>
<p>We mentioned in the outline that we need to deduplicate the repositories.
We need to do that for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As stated earlier, we don't want to download every single fork of every single famous project out there.</li>
<li>Duplicated data means that our database of repos grows very fast in size. The first ~100K repos we downloaded from GitHub amount to ~1.4TB of <code>gzip</code>'d source code (without <code>git</code> history), so you can see why this is an important point.</li>
<li>Duplicated data is bad for <strong>search results accuracy</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>GHTorrent has information about forks but, as for GitHub itself, that only counts forks created with the <em>"Fork"</em> button on the web UI.
The other option is to look for common commits between repositories.
If we had infinite computing resources, we would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Clone every repository</strong> we care about.</li>
<li>Put every commit hash in a <strong>graph database</strong> of some kind.</li>
<li>Connect commit hashes using their <strong>parent/child relationship</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>root commits</strong>.</li>
<li>For every root commit, <strong>keep only the most-starred repo</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we live in the real world, so this is simply impossible for us to do.
We would like to have a strategy to deduplicate repos <strong>before</strong> cloning them, as cloning would require a lot of time and bandwidth.
On top of that, when using git you can merge the history of totally-unrelated projects.
So, if you deduplicate repos based on the root commit alone, you end up removing a lot of projects you actually want to keep.</p>
<p>Case in point: <strong><a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife"><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code></a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Octocat</h2>
<p><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code> is the <strong>most forked project</strong> on GitHub, and there's a reason for that: it's the repo that is used in GitHub's <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">tutorial on forking</a>.
This means that a lot of people learning to use GitHub have forked this repo at some point.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why <code>Spoon-Knife</code> causes troubles to our theoretical deduplication algorithm.
Well, take a look at this screenshot of <code>LibreCAD</code>'s git history:</p>
<p><img alt="LibreCAD history" src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/librecad.png"></p>
<p>At some point in the past some user by the name of <code>youarefunny</code> was learning to use GitHub and so he forked <code>Spoon-Knife</code>.
At some other point, he forked <code>LibreCAD</code> and made some commits.
Then, for whatever reason, he thought <em>"well, why not merge the history of these two nice repositories in a single one? So we can have a branch with the history of both projects!"</em>.
And finally, just to <del>fuck with us</del> contribute to a useful open-source project like <code>LibreCAD</code>, he decided to open a pull request using that exact branch.
And that pull request was accepted.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> the history of <code>Spoon-Knife</code> is included in <code>LibreCAD</code>'s repo.</p>
<p>If you want to check this out, visit <a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/commit/f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170">this link</a> or clone <code>LibreCAD/LibreCAD</code> and run <code>git diff f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170</code>.</p>
<p>Things like this present a serious issue for us because <code>Spoon-Knife</code> has 10.3k stars at the moment, while <code>LibreCAD</code> only has 2k.
Which means that if we were to remove the least starred project, we would actually remove <code>LibreCAD</code> and keep the utterly useless <code>Spoon-Knife</code> repo.</p>
<p>I hate you <code>yourefunny</code>.
And no, you are not actually funny.</p>
<p>But <code>yourefunny</code> is not alone in this: during our tests we've found that some people also like to merge the history of Linux and LLVM.
Go figure.</p>
<h2>Best-effort deduplication</h2>
<p>So we can't <code>git clone</code> every repo on GitHub and we can't do root-based deduplication.
What we can do is use GHTorrent once again and implement a different strategy.
In fact, <strong>GHTorrent has information about commits</strong>, too, albeit limited.
This is what it gives us:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(parent commit, child commit)</code> relations.</li>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(commit, repository)</code> relations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Exploiting this data we can't reconstruct the full git history of every repository, but we can recreate <strong>subgraphs</strong> of it.
We then apply this algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a commit for which GHTorrent doesn't have a parent (we call them <em>parentless commits</em>) and consider it a root commit.</li>
<li>Explore the commit history graph starting at a root commit. We do this going <strong>upward</strong>, that is, only following <code>parent → child</code> edges.</li>
<li>We group all the repositories associated with the commits of a subgraph we obtain in step 2. We call such group a <em>repository group</em>.</li>
<li>For every repository group, we find the most starred repo it contains and consider it the <em>parent repo</em>, …</li></ol></div></div>

  </p>


<p>x86 is back in the general programmer discourse, in part thanks to Apple’s M1 and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.
As such, I figured I’d do <em>yet another</em> x86-64 post.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory">the last one</a>,
I’m going to cover a facet of the x86-64 ISA that sets it apart
as unusually complex among modern ISAs: the number and diversity of registers available.</p>

<p><a href="https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/">Like instruction counting</a>,
register counting on x86-64 is subject to debates over methodology. In particular, for this blog
post, I’m going to lay the following ground rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count sub-registers (e.g., <code>EAX</code> for <code>RAX</code>) as distinct registers. My justification:
they have different instruction encodings, and both Intel and AMD optimize/pessimize
particular sub-register use patterns in their microcode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that are present on x86-64 CPUs, but that can’t be used in long mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count registers that are <em>only</em> present on older x86 CPUs, like the 80386 and
80486 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_register">test registers</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count microarchitectural implementation details, like shadow registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that aren’t directly addressable, like MSRs that can only be accessed
through <code>RDMSR</code>. However, I <strong>won’t</strong> (or will try not to) double-count registers that
have multiple access mechanisms (like <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>RDTSC</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count model-specific registers that fall into these categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MSRs that are only present on niche x86 vendors (Cyrix, Via)</li>
      <li>MSRs that aren’t widely available on recent-ish x86-64 CPUs
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Errata</strong>: I accidentally included AVX-512 in some of the original counts below,
  not realizing that it hadn’t been released on any AMD CPUs. The post has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MSRs that are <em>completely</em> undocumented (both officially and unofficially)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the rules above, I’m going to use the following considerations and methodology
for grouping registers together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many sources, both official and unofficial, use “model-specific register” as an umbrella term
for any non-core or non-feature-set register supplied by an x86-64 CPU. Whenever possible, I’ll
try to avoid this in favor of more specific categories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Intel and AMD provide synonyms for registers (e.g. <code>CR8</code> as the “task priority register,” or
<code>TPR</code>). Whenever possible, I’ll try to use the more generic/category conforming name (like <code>CR8</code>
in the case above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the individual cores of a multicore processor have independent register states.
Whenever this <strong>isn’t</strong> the case, I’ll make an effort to document it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers">General-purpose registers</h2>

<p>The general-purpose registers (or GPRs) are <strong>the</strong> primary registers in the x86-64 register model.
As their name implies, they are the <strong>only</strong> registers that are <em>general purpose</em>: each has a set
of conventional uses<sup id="fnref:conventional" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conventional">1</a></sup>, but programmers are generally free to ignore those conventions and use
them as they please<sup id="fnref:ignore" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ignore">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because x86-64 evolved from a 32-bit ISA which in turn evolved from a 16-bit ISA, each
GPR has a set of <em>subregisters</em> that hold the lower 8, 16 and 32 bits of the full 64-bit
register.</p>

<p>As a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>64-bit</th>
    
    <th>32-bit</th>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>

    <td>RSI</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>RSP</td>

    <td>SP</td>
    
    <td>SPL</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R8</td>
    
    <td>R8D</td>
    
    <td>R8W</td>
    
    <td>R8B</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R9</td>
    
    <td>R9D</td>

  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R10</td>
    
    <td>R10D</td>
    
    <td>R10W</td>

  <tr>

    <td>R11W</td>
    
    <td>R11B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R12</td>
    
    <td>R12D</td>
    
    <td>R12W</td>
    
    <td>R12B</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R13</td>
    
    <td>R13D</td>
    
    <td>R13W</td>
    
    <td>R13B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R14</td>
    
    <td>R14D</td>
    
    <td>R14W</td>
    
    <td>R14B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R15</td>
    
    <td>R15D</td>
    
    <td>R15W</td>
    
    <td>R15B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>Some of the 16-bit subregisters are also special: the original 8086 allowed the <strong>high</strong> byte
of <code>AX</code>, <code>BX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> to be accessed indepenently, so x86-64 preserves this for some
encodings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>
    
    <th>8-bit (high)</th>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>AX</td>
    
    <td> AH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>BX</td>
    
    <td> BH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>CX</td>
    
    <td> CH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>DX</td>
    
    <td> DH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>So that’s 16 full-width GPRs, fanning out to another 52 subregisters.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 68</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 68</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="special-registers">Special registers</h2>

<p>This is sort of an artificial category: like every ISA, x86-64 has a few “special” registers that
keep things moving along. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>instruction pointer</em>, or <code>RIP</code>.</p>

    <p>x86-64 has 32- and 16-bit variants of <code>RIP</code> (<code>EIP</code> and <code>IP</code>), but I’m <strong>not</strong> going to count
  them as separate registers: they have identical encodings and can’t be used in the same
  CPU mode<sup id="fnref:ip" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ip">3</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>status register</em>, or <code>RFLAGS</code>.</p>

    <p>Just like <code>RIP</code>, <code>RFLAGS</code> has 32- and 16-bit counterparts (<code>EFLAGS</code> and <code>FLAGS</code>). Unlike
  <code>RIP</code>, these counterparts can be partially mixed: <code>PUSHF</code> and <code>PUSHFQ</code> are both valid in
  long mode, and <code>LAHF</code>/<code>SAHF</code> can operate on the bits of <code>FLAGS</code> on some x86-64 CPUs
  outside of compatiblility mode<sup id="fnref:cpuid-lahf-sahf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cpuid-lahf-sahf">4</a></sup>. So I’m going to go ahead and count them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 4</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 72</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="segment-registers">Segment registers</h2>

<p>x86-64 has a total of 6 segment registers: <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, <code>FS</code>, and <code>GS</code>. The operation
varies with the CPU’s mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In all modes except for long mode, each segment register holds a <em>selector</em>, which indexes into
either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table">GDT</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table#Local_Descriptor_Table">LDT</a>. That yields
a segment <em>descriptor</em> which, among other things, supplies the base address and extent of the
segment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In long mode all but <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are treated as having a base address of zero and a 64-bit
extent, effectively producing a flat address space. <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are retained as special cases,
but no longer use the segment descriptor tables: instead, they access base addresses that
are stored in the <code>FSBASE</code> and <code>GSBASE</code> model-specific registers<sup id="fnref:kernelgsbase" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kernelgsbase">5</a></sup>.
More on those later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 6</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 78</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simd-and-fp-registers">SIMD and FP registers</h2>

<p>The x86 family has gone through <em>several</em> generations of SIMD and floating-point instruction
groups, each of which has introduced, extended, or re-contextualized various registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>x87</li>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, SSE4, …)</li>
  <li>AVX (AVX2, AVX512)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s do them in rough order.</p>

<h3 id="x87">x87</h3>

<p>Originally a discrete coprocessor with its own instruction set and register file, the x87
instructions have been regularly baked into x86 cores themselves since the 80486.</p>

<p>Because of its coprocessor history, x87 defines both normal registers<sup id="fnref:normal-ish" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:normal-ish">6</a></sup>
(akin to GPRs) and a variety of special registers needed to control the FPU state:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ST0</code> through <code>ST7</code>: 8 80-bit floating-point registers</li>
  <li><code>FPSW</code>, <code>FPCW</code>, <code>FPTW</code> <sup id="fnref:mynames" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mynames">7</a></sup>: Control, status, and tag-word registers</li>
  <li>“Data operand pointer”: I don’t know what this one does, but the Intel SDM specifies it<sup id="fnref:sdm" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sdm">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>Instruction pointer: the x87 state machine apparently holds its own copy of the current
x87 instruction</li>
  <li>Last instruction opcode: this is apparently distinct from the x87 opcode, and has its
own register</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 14</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 92</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mmx">MMX</h3>

<p>MMX was Intel’s first attempt at consumer SIMD in their x86 chips, released back in 1997.</p>

<p>For design reasons that are a complete mystery to me, the MMX registers are actually sub-registers
of the x87 <code>STn</code> registers: each 64-bit <code>MMn</code> occupies the mantissa component of its corresponding
<code>STn</code>. Consequently, x86 (and x86-64) CPUs cannot execute MMX and x87 instructions at the same time.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>MM0</code> through <code>MM7</code>, MMX also defines a new status register (<code>MXCSR</code>) as well as
a load/store instruction pair for manipulating it (<code>LDMXCSR</code> and <code>STMXCSR</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 9</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 101</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sse-and-avx">SSE and AVX</h3>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, I’m going to wrap SSE and AVX into a single section: they use the same
sub-register pattern as the GPRs and x87/MMX do, so they fit well into a single table:</p>

<p>In other words: the lower half of each <code>ZMMn</code> is <code>YMMn</code>, and the lower half of each <code>YMMn</code> is
<code>XMMn</code>. There’s no direct way register access for just the upper half of <code>YMMn</code>, nor does
<code>ZMMn</code> have direct 256- or 128-bit access for the thunks of its upper half.</p>

<p>SSE also defines a new status register, <code>MXCSR</code>, that contains flags roughly parallel
to the arithmetic flags in <code>RFLAGS</code> (along with floating-point flags in the x87 status word).</p>

<p>AVX-512 <strong>also</strong> introduces eight <em>opmask</em> registers, <code>k0</code> through <code>k7</code>. <code>k0</code> is a special case
that behaves much like the “zero” register on some RISC ISAs: it can’t be stored to, and
loads from it always produce a bitmask of all ones.</p>

<p><strong>Errata</strong>: The table above includes AVX-512, which isn’t available on any AMD CPUs as of 2020.
I’ve updated the counts below to only include SSE and AVX2-introduced registers.</p>

<h2 id="bounds-registers">Bounds registers</h2>

<p>Intel added these with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MPX">MPX</a>, which was intended to
offer hardware-accelerated bounds checking. Nobody uses it, since
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Intel-MPX-Is-Dead">it doesn’t work very well</a>.
But x86 is eternal and slow to fix mistakes, so we’ll probably have these registers taking up space
for at least a while longer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BND0</code> — <code>BND3</code>: Individual 128-bit registers, each containing a pair of addresses
for a bound.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFG</code>: Bound configuration, kernel mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFU</code>: Bound configuration, user mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDSTATUS</code>: Bound status, after a <code>#BR</code> is raised.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="debug-registers">Debug registers</h2>

<p>These are what they sound like: registers that aid and accelerate software debuggers, like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>.</p>

<p>There are 6 debug registers of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR0</code> through <code>DR3</code> contain linear addresses, each of which is associated with a breakpoint
condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code> are the debug status and control registers. <code>DR6</code>’s lower bits indicate which
debug conditions were encountered (upon entering the debug exception handler), while <code>DR7</code> controls
which breakpoint addresses are enabled and their breakpoint conditions (e.g., when a particular
address is written to).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What about <code>DR4</code> and <code>DR5</code>? For reasons that are unclear to me, they don’t (and have never)
existed<sup id="fnref:guess" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:guess">9</a></sup>. They <em>do</em> have encodings but are treated as <code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code>, respective, or produce
an <code>#UD</code> exception when <code>CR4.DE[bit 3] = 1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 6.</strong></p>

<article>
<p>I have no real interests or hobbies. If I was shopping for myself I’d probably just buy another book on “growing your side hustle” or one of the many “building a startup” books.</p>
<p>Revenue, monetization, and profit are always the primary driver for my activities. Whether or not I actually care about a particular topic is sorta irrelevant. And my frustration is that depending on who I talk to, I get entirely different perspectives on whether this going to facilitate my success in life or not. For example, people who are like my business/money focused family applaud my efforts. They don’t understand how this is bad.</p>
<p>“Dave, how is spending your free time trying to make more money a bad thing? You can use that money to pursue your hobbies or interests.”</p>
<p>“Yeah uncle, but I honestly don’t know what my hobbies and interests are besides things that make more money.”</p>
<p>“Great Dave, so your passion is making money!”</p>
<p>“But I don’t want that to be my passion!”</p>
<p>But if I talk to my more passion focused friends, I’m sorta self-judging in my head.</p>
<p>“Dave, I’m working on a youth charity. It’s soo many hours of long work and stressful, but really rewarding.”</p>
<p>“Oh umm…that’s great Pam. But that’s a lot of work, and no money? Like…is it really worth it? Imagine if you turned it into some type of education business. What’s the market like for that? You could charge at least $300 per student.”</p>
<p>Ugh, this is what gives me migraines. My 25 year old anxiety is telling me that if I pick the wrong strategy then my future is forever doomed. I also have no idea where this obsession began. I didn’t grow up poor, so I can’t use that as an excuse for my obsession. I think it might have to do with imposter syndrome and feeling like I have to prove myself. Basically, if I have lots of money rolling in then I can say “fuck the system” and not be criticized. I falsely feel like people can’t judge me if I have my own business that’s making Elon Musk level income.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s simply because I live in the United States, and that’s just our culture here. Plus with all the uncertainty, you never know when debt can hit you. Poverty, streets, homeless shelter, etc.</p>
<p>But this just all feels wrong to me. It feels like I’m digging myself into a bad hole. What if my time was used toward genuine activities and interests? I could also have a chance at financial success with those. I just don’t know what those genuine interests are. All I know is that when I chase after these money quests, I always feel cheated in the end.</p>
<p>Let’s walk inside my mind for a second.</p>
<p>So I work on coding side projects outside of work. Do I love coding and problem solving? Eh, I’m not really sure. But, I do love the idea of one day rolling in cash from some tool or app I built. Therefore, I’m going to spend my time trying to find a niche market that I can penetrate with some basic app/program that I can at least charge $100 a month for. Then I just need to spend a couple of hours everyday scouring through Google trends, Reddit, or Exploding Topics to find something people are currently into. Then maybe set up a landing page, and see if people enter in their credit card info. Or how about I search the Apple App Store and find some shitty app that people pay big bucks for and copy it? Oh wait, hold up, snack boxes are trending! Okay, so I can just set up a service for $20 a month to send people almonds, right?</p>
<p>Trust me, it gets worst.</p>
<p>I make videos on YouTube. I have a little over 200k subscribers currently. Do I like making videos? Eh…I’m not really sure. Truthfully, most days I would rather not engage in the activity. But influencer sponsorships pay a lot! Also, adsense is a really nice passive income source. So what I need to do is spend my time studying the YouTube algorithm so I can produce videos that get more views. More views equals more money!! Oh and remember when I made videos on Android? Yeah nobody cares about that niche anymore. So I’m going to use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ to see trending topics that people are watching. Okay people are all talking about <em>Among Us</em> right now. So if I make a video that’s at least 10 minutes long I can stick a mid-roll ad into it too! Don’t forget all the long-tail keywords. Wait, my website hardly has any ads on it right now. I’m missing out on extra income! I need at least a sidebar ad and also a footer ad.</p>
<p>Guess what? After two days I lost motivation in the Snackbox idea. As for YouTube, I made videos on the “well researched SEO friendly topics” and they performed horribly. It was like another slap in the face saying “Dave, this is what happens when you chase money without regard for interests.” But….but…all the entrepreneurs say just having interest in building a business is enough!</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don’t know what to say or how to end this. I’m just hoping that by sharing my obstacles and fears I get some helpful incite; or at least connect people who also share this struggle. I feel like it’s one of the many problems that’s not addressed adequately and leaves us just desperate for answers.</p>

                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way we operate in the world. One of the most significant changes has been a large shift to remote work. According to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceo-panel-survey-emerge-stronger.pdf">survey conducted by PwC</a>, 80% of CEOs expect widespread remote work to continue even after COVID-19 passes.</p><p>With distributed workforces becoming more prevalent, the use of video conferencing technology has skyrocketed. We used our <a href="https://www.datashake.com/review-index-api">Review Index API</a> to analyze the aggregated consumer reviews of Zoom Video Communications and how those reviews relate to the company’s stock performance.</p><blockquote>We include the notebook used for this data analysis at the end of this post, as well as all the raw data for your own analysis.</blockquote><p>Extracting the online review data for this analysis was made easy by our Review Index API, allowing us to extract Zoom's online reviews in just one API call:</p><figure><pre><code>$ curl --request GET --url 'https://app.datashake.com/api/v2/review_index?domain=zoom.us&amp;ticker_symbol=ZM' --header 'spiderman-token: API_KEY'</code></pre><figcaption>Remember to replace API_KEY with your own API key.</figcaption></figure><p>In the background, this API has done the heavy lifting of indexing all of Zoom's review profiles across the Internet, along with their associated reviews.</p><h2 id="diving-into-the-data">Diving into the Data</h2><p><strong>Review Rating</strong></p><p>Although Zoom has exploded in popularity since the pandemic, it has been a favorite among remote workers for years. Zoom is not only a great video conferencing software but a top software company overall. The Software Report, which ranks companies based on industry professional and customer reviews, <a href="https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/the-top-100-software-companies-of-2020/">ranked Zoom 33rd best</a> software company in the world in 2020.</p><p>Compared to its competitors – which include BlueJeans, GoToMeeting, Join.me, Skype, Slack and Webex – Zoom’s consumer reviews are exceptional. Since the beginning of 2019, Zoom’s average review rating has not dropped below a score of 4 (out of 5).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iTGuYrDaOXUWe_7-zwD7_wvRfN9RUKfa-4l8L5II9Jnevn4nBaktsi5TL1G8Vbb2AhfVJUnsQUbUhEhSp6gx47lTBe_DoBiP_pswrULTac5x2yJxDnCPouo1Of5K4vsnZXM_DQJDzRg82tT2mg" alt=""></figure><p>However, Zoom’s average rating has dropped slightly since COVID-19 started. Before the pandemic, Zoom averaged a review rating of 4.66 and averaged a review rating of 4.55 after the pandemic.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/z9aeFU3rcw06ELomxMX2TE6yArPS40r5ZQ8nMF6DFvxkcMgjXlPF9iEMK-EOWLMRAQaQqR2o7IYcWTr394DT_oFCcl4Up0n2pwkAax01VCz5zIeJUvWEfMQgzxRT6LAX7ZHZEXgpuIyqyFP4gg" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Review Text</strong><br>Zoom’s rating drop can most likely be attributed to a large influx of new users putting more stress on their infrastructure. Our Review Index API also comes with the actual review text for every review across multiple platforms. &nbsp;If we look at reviews with a rating of 3 or worse that mention “quality” in the review text, we can get a good idea of how many consumers were unhappy with Zoom’s quality.</p><p>We can see from the chart below that quality issue reviews spiked from July to August, right around the same time Zoom’s average rating dropped. The review rating and the percentage of quality issue reviews have a correlation coefficient of -0.38. So, when quality issues rise, the average review rating tends to drop.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7NtOKn_xUFg_lnDp3femO58IgmqNPDKiBukZpRzUCYCz1aQIQbuoIL71o3wR0dp_oDYBJdlGv3WoO77lAXfrGlZVHecdfMtJY59BYS5kpg9q_BbpsczVAeT_yrisLUjfuRVf60d37BKjm__N6Q" alt=""></figure><p>After COVID-19 began, Zoom’s average rating dropped by 2.2%, which was the second to worst drop compared to Join.me’s 2.3% drop. Zoom’s quality issues may be something to keep an eye on in the short-term but a well-managed company like Zoom should be able to make the necessary adjustments.</p><p><strong>Review Volume</strong></p><p>When it comes to review volume, Zoom’s advantage over competitors becomes more apparent. Since COVID-19 began, the review volume of Zoom’s competitors has dropped or only slightly risen while Zoom’s review volume has surged.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GfyE4NBkIYLa6zbPHtSeVrESc5dEbGu9r6KO8mWCS6fBs_JxCbLj_ZZ6H3XrDNPV0mpRuFg_98cgGaB8VBFTWXpad4HeFrqt9nCqcWrnd1EHJR6KJLrN44QqXquRSusg9ht9vfjIcdeANhU3DA" alt=""></figure><p>Before COVID, Zoom and Slack were fairly even at 22 and 20 average daily reviews, respectively. After COVID, Zoom averaged 40 daily reviews and Slack’s average dropped to 12 daily reviews. Zoom’s review volume peaked in early October at a whopping 95 reviews per day.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_BsaLOOWX_gooJMmoH893ndZhdGP9mF0dxpHXTK5xEoapmZ7SpTyo0oImWXyy-Tqm_avWWHnXfoQqRDWiyrUcPQsS4LrXzlxizfMwgc5cMulkkPNB5CqSqkO9jXkj2KrK8qid-AksNHzsmfgQA" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Stock Prediction</strong></p><p><strong>Review Data &amp; Stock Correlation</strong></p><p>Zoom’s rapidly growing review volume is reflected in its stock price. When the noise of both the stock price and review volume data is smoothed with a 20-day moving average, the two have a 0.51 correlation coefficient. So, generally, when one goes up so does the other.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FNbCbXS2NH1IU5fIy_G0Kry4HZdfTDOy5pQfOIIIxr42LmStGxxJKH5KRLerrG0f9ke9pHFxJPCZGj1wCWk6USN8N7D-8Kwye9PYyuKJYB3gABzTPKVpyezzq7OJqm0FRBQFJlrACGp1W9e-_Q" alt=""><figcaption>Note: The parent companies of Skype (Microsoft), BlueJeans (Verizon) and Webex (Cisco) are shown in the chart above. GoToMeeting and Join.me are privately owned.</figcaption></figure><p>Stocks overall have performed well since the lockdown due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, but few have performed as well as Zoom. &nbsp;Zoom’s stock price has grown four times larger than its closest competitor since the lockdowns started and eight times larger than its closest competitor since the middle of 2019. Zoom’s average daily stock returns grew from 0.5% before the pandemic to 1.1% after the pandemic.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/te4pDczFeqFYQVkHRJdJXk9E_SORbe1fjPtRPqL7eH-JEnThErsMN4Fjlm6OibMVeihXCPjzUnlL4VAJnim7sjbpMZ-ojnLRY_u1d-IvprlwCQSUU8uuqlWiLmaAj-is335RIodvxXZZBTqEmg" alt=""></figure><p>Zoom’s review volume and stock price are not the only interesting correlation. Zoom’s review volume and trading volume have a correlation coefficient of 0.39.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XnNI4DaO8JmSeeix_TwjjWf1TW4gMVdeq_J2cv22St58nnzFf5WfexkNaGKHFpqEIaD5TkDCO_UCYyWZOxZ_1cL7_o_o5suKMDnOkDOdsAtDK7e1Ei15wRCpYo4dv40leMm0TtmJ88hoDzaZvQ" alt=""></figure><p>There are strong similarities between Zoom’s review volume and trading volume, but the two curves were a bit out of sync. Shifting review volume back 12 days raises the correlation coefficient to 0.47. This relationship could be used to reaffirm buy/sell signals from On-Balance Volume (OBV) or similar indicators.</p><p>There is also a relationship between Zoom’s review volume and stock price volatility.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZCj_crYjjKq3mGZyPKUC8gkObPvDPHrr1ZddJ7n-T-xJgkN4giKWRZvekUgSfemstnDJId9FNDp2Ja8DNLd6cxkGadAsVY5Qqf1OpN-G77X-BUWiPmCrvfmAOYQnRFvZeo2eHwO-0XNS5_lrtw" alt=""></figure><p>If we shift Zoom’s review volume back 27 days, the correlation coefficient with volatility goes from 0.06 to 0.51.<br></p><p><strong>Methodology</strong></p><p>Because there’s a clear relationship between Zoom’s online reviews and their stock data, we set out to use the review data to predict Zoom’s stock price movements. The goal was to build a machine learning model with decent accuracy and determine which features (variables) were most predictive.</p><p>Along with the review volume, review rating, the quality issues metric and basic stock price data, we used some of the most common technical indicators, including simple and exponential moving averages, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Bands and Relative Strength Index (RSI).</p><p>We also built another feature to add context to the review data. &nbsp;We used Python’s TextBlob package to apply a sentiment score to each review text. The sentiment scores range from -1 to 1, with -1 being perfectly negative, 1 being perfectly positive and 0 being neutral. The sentiment scores are normally distributed and centered on ~0.25.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/k5UrRhRgMSaDq7MDhQb46hcymBXXz9uzJ0kXsQsGYOjChymXAcb0hRV9KyV3MsxK2BVSmkGWJjF0j0nPTLO_dlkYrlxuuHZRkg6RnloEzl3nyeq9eoNacFxw1I9mswlOcFmL5Gcy4DAddx0Juw" alt=""></figure><p>The data was split into training and test datasets, with the test dataset being the last 75 days of trading and the training dataset being the 277 trading days before that.</p><p>Several machine learning models were trained and tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB, Random Forest, Adaboost and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)/LSTM. The variable being predicted was the following day’s price direction (up or down) from the opening price to the closing price.</p><p>In the entire dataset, 51.4% of the days had a price direction of “up.” So, if we used a model that guessed the majority class (up) every time, we would be correct about 51% of the time. We used this baseline accuracy as the accuracy to beat.</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>Out of the standard machine learning models, the Adaboost with a Random Forest base estimator performed the best with an accuracy of 53.3%. Although this accuracy leaves something to be desired, this particular model provides us with an opportunity to evaluate the predictive power of our variables.</p><p>With decision tree models, like the Random Forest, <a href="https://medium.com/bigdatarepublic/feature-importance-whats-in-a-name-79532e59eea3">Feature Importances</a> can be calculated to determine each variables impact on the accuracy of the model. Out of all the features used in the model, the sentiment score and review volume ranked 2nd and 4th most important in terms of predictive power. Our quality issues metric did not perform as well as hoped.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4y4whSq75-9ddw29zYeSO7VTFJJk2r3IMxCKZa25RXUJS2K-nc0srFtTOcfDu0HXOZtQHBAivNS8I0rdzsYpzvZ7uwTvnvpWn5IDvey5FkuqFgGHClJlCGDgYzpkad1TWSGaOi0zVPPbPZ0NSg" alt=""></figure><p>The standard machine learning models resulted in mediocre accuracy and were quite overfit. The RNN/LSTM model improved prediction accuracy significantly. The accuracy improvement is most likely due to the RNN’s ability to learn patterns across time. &nbsp;We also added dropout layers to reduce the problem of overfitting.</p><p>Below you can see the architecture of the Recurrent Neural Network. In this simple design, each LSTM layer is followed by a Dropout layer. The Dense output layer has a sigmoid activation function which keeps outputs in the range of 0 to 1. An output greater than to 0.5 is a prediction of “up” and an output less than or equal to 0.5 is a prediction of “down.” The learning rate was 0.01, the loss was binary cross-entropy and the optimizer used was Adam. The model was trained over 400 epochs and the batch size was 15 samples. The data was preprocessed to reflect a 10-day look-back period.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qb-0oPqiNak61VqYqqMmxzuPorQtNeHArqNQIIvUxrB0ki1HIfAzb63vjgVha3xb3u6Pry8ujsVKKaPC_4ybNbeaVDwdIreW7Va6rcidiJoJyYHudd5W6PRnxaXuxiuYSuxwO5m1A05EJL24SQ" alt=""></figure><p>If we look at the accuracy over all epochs, we see that the training and validation accuracy converges over time. Adding the Dropout layers greatly reduced overfitting. The validation accuracy peaked in epoch 339 at an accuracy of 59%.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7JdYooEefkYTX6xcGw-7Jgf40x8Xq7i6w0yw5V4oA8WIHmgRqSZHzCuduj-6sLkUnZTTVhdedRf0MKcbqSo2QOrTFNgwNnsytlTLoZp-RjvNsm4xtHX-SB5SPsFVVLCIsQTCLMosS2l__s37Fw" alt=""></figure><p>If we look at the loss over all epochs, we will notice something strange. Although the validation accuracy improved throughout training, the validation loss drifted upward. This is unusual, but a bit of research revealed that it is due to the model making worse and worse predictions on samples where it was already wrong. For example, let’s say the correct prediction for a sample was “down.” The sigmoid function would output a 0.60 (up) in the first epoch, then a 0.70 in the next epoch, a 0.80 in the next epoch and so on. The prediction was always wrong, but the sigmoid function kept outputting a worse result.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZJFPH8EGR0oe5s7Rc5eyYP625_BxkOjtQWlYWJcXukHRDZwsDNRbWKULvdKBq5-YDOXbr93ltmIZ4CAdqDOlj2MZVPKcjmS8Pxciavki0hPOYbprpPndhLrLD3lJbxA6FQHwsNHYUY3zTzNXw" alt=""></figure><p>Although the validation loss drifted slightly upward, the epoch where the model accuracy peaked (339) coincided with a local minimum in validation loss.</p><p>Below we can see a confusion matrix of the test dataset predictions. The model is more reluctant to predict up days than down days. However, when the model does predict up days, it does so with greater accuracy. The model precision (i.e. true positives over total predicted positives) is 77.8%.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3t8PKgjXQM7Dn2k__ATFbJ5IWah4EoCx4si16XIv6ivK7m183MDAh7ds6XtdxH7VxrK9h91hC2Q6opgGdLblpzULmurE1ljonaXQjXG25eWxeYUGqy6lqUGMfhZPdkUl07Cb9AP5fe_eiuG66Q" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Zoom’s success since the COVID-19 pandemic began has caught the attention of workers, technologists and investors.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-89cfead268f30384aa7d"><div><p><em>TLDR: Simplicity is still a controversial topic. Most argue that consumers desire simpler products. Some argue that they want simplicity but only if it is executed correctly (what that means is often left undefined). And a few believe that it’s actually complexity that makes consumers buy. This disagreement is rooted in the fact that no one seems to agree on what simplicity means. I suggest avoiding using it in any professional capacity, in favor of a more precise tool kit. What motivates the buying decision are the 3 components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation, ability, and prompt. Motivation, in order to make the sale, can be further broken down into the Job To Be Done (why is the consumer hiring the product?) and acute satisfaction (how badly do they want it in that moment?). Ability, making a behavior easier or harder to do, can be subdivided into time, money, physical effort, mental effort, repetition, social deviance, location in space, and location in time. Getting comfortable with these concepts will give you a productive framework to work with when deciding what features to include/exclude, and help you create products people actually want to buy, use, and recommend.</em></p><p>One of the most fundamental theorems to have come out of behavior science is that <strong>shine changes behavior</strong>.</p><p>What’s shine? Shine is the emotion you feel when you feel successful. When you aced that job interview, got your first customer, or finally won that match in your game or sport. [1] By making behavior easy to do, you increase the probability that you’ll succeed instead of fail. When you succeed, you feel successful which reinforces the connection in your brain between that behavior and that positive feeling, and that leads  to behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p>Simplicity → Shine → Behavior Change.</p><p>Because simplicity means so many different things to so many different people, a more precise way to think about it is in terms of ability. High ability means a behavior is easy to do. Low ability means it’s hard to do. So when you’re thinking about consumer behavior change, think about increasing ability, making it easy to do.</p><p><em>For the purpose of this essay you can use consumer and user interchangeably.</em></p><p>Obvious right? Well, no. The problem with fields like behavior science is tool bias. Which I described in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/covid" target="_blank">Covid-19 And Human (Ir)Rationality — PART 1</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a fascinating bias I call tool bias (if it has an official name, let me know), which ties the complexity of the tool to the perception of difficulty. Math can appear complex even when the application is very simple. Influencing behavior can appear simple even when the application is very complex. This phenomenon occurs in comedy as well. It’s easy to underestimate how difficult it is to create a good set because the tools (language) are simple, so while you laugh you think, I could do this easily.”</p></blockquote><p>I.e. behavior science suffers from hindsight bias because it’s so easy to understand. It all appears obvious ex post facto.&nbsp;</p><p>If something seems easy, we think “that must BE easy.”</p><p>But if you were to ask around as to what creates behavior change, you’d get many different answers (mainly around motivation) but making things easy to do wouldn’t be one of them. [2]</p><p>Okay, if simplicity or more precisely, increasing ability is so important (and obvious) then why are products so complicated?</p><p>Because it’s that very complexity that sells.</p><p>When we see something that’s complex, we think “that must have a lot of value.” If you’re a consultant giving simple answers to complex problems, it seems as though you’re not very smart or, at the very least, you aren’t taking it seriously. When you make it so complex that people can hardly follow along, it becomes hard for people to estimate the boundaries of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g. suppose you hire a consultant to help you with next year’s strategy. If they give you a thick stack of papers that supports their conclusion, you’ll perceive it more favorably than if they give you a single sheet with 2 paragraphs on it, sharing that same conclusion. Complexity acts as a heuristic for value. [3]</p><p><em>An obvious, but important nonetheless note, is that truth has to be measured by truth, not truthiness. </em><strong><em>Complexity impacts truthiness but it has no correlation with truth</em></strong><em>. I.e. just because something is complex doesn’t make it true. Just because something is simple doesn’t make it false. But that’s exactly the cognitive bias we have and partly explains our obsession with data-driven arguments. Read </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/misleadingdata?rq=data" target="_blank"><em>Your Data Is Lying To You And You’re Listening</em></a><em> for more on that.</em></p><p>Is this only true in information? No. You see the same phenomenon from consumer products to enterprise software.</p><p>According to Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust (2005), increasing the complexity of a product can have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction because of an increase in perceived capability.</p><p>Look at the following products:</p><p><strong>Stripey toothpaste: </strong>Why do they go to so much trouble to make sure stripey toothpaste comes out of the tube, well… stripey? An overly logical engineer would see that and claim that you should just mix the products. It would have the exact same effect on oral hygiene and you’d actually save on cost. But that’s only correct if your customers were logical robots. But they’re emotional humans. Consumers simply don’t believe your toothpaste has 3 functions if they don’t see it. ‘’Healthy gums. Strong teeth. Fresh breath.” Show me, don’t tell me.</p><p><strong>Dishwashing tablet: </strong>Same argument. Just blend all the ingredients into one homogenous tablet. But again, I, the consumer, wouldn’t believe you.</p><p><strong>Toilet rim block: </strong>Look at how these simple blocks have grown in complexity. Multiple liquids in a container, different colored solid spheres, sticky discs you shoot onto your bowl, etc. [4]</p><p><strong>Coffee machine: </strong>The most expensive ones have the most gizmos. More features to increase perceived capability, which is exactly what I, the consumer, want. Take Dolce Gusto machines for example. A manual lever to flip to make coffee? What am I, a 17th-century peasant?! I’ll take the model with the fancy LCD touch screen so I can feel like Louis the 14th thank you very much.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_102553"><p><strong>Cars: </strong>Steering wheels with roughly similar complexity as NASA's mission control. Mirrors that can be moved electronically, are heated, dim based on light intensity, and more. Just take a look at the incredible feature set of these 2021headlights:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_35746"><p><strong>iOS:</strong> Remember that the original “iPhone OS” didn’t even have an Appstore yet?

But also… well, no.</p><p>There are many UX experts that advocate precisely this. “Simplicity is overrated and consumers, ceteris paribus, want more features because they want the most powerful products.”</p><p>This is partly true. Would you pay more for a phone that does less? It has a basic camera, or perhaps no camera, it has less memory, it’s not fast, it’s missing features (even if you don’t use them). Probably not. While one can imagine an audience of minimalists for that, one can’t imagine that they’d pay more for it than the flagship phone which sets the anchor for that particular price hierarchy.</p><p>But if that’s the whole story, that raises the question, why do products ever get disrupted? Surely, if features sell then Yahoo wouldn’t have gotten disrupted by Google. Or Netflix by Blockbuster. Or Facebook by Myspace. Or any other startup, since pretty much all of them started very simple.</p><p>The erroneous assumption here is that simple means getting rid of features. But a car that’s missing two wheels, the engine, and the body, that’s not simplicity. That’s not even a car. A bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; a cordless bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; the Dysons we have now with all kinds of attachments, different vacuum heads, and automatically adjusting suction levels… now you’ve got my attention. The “simple” Dysons still had high usability despite lower capability. So it’s not just about removing features, it’s about being diligent about which features you do add. And your customers are the arbiter that decide whether or not you got it right.</p><p>On top of that, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) demonstrated that an increase in features (even the right features) doesn’t automatically translate into more consumer satisfaction. In fact, as perceived capability increases, perceived usability decreases. This is known as feature fatigue. (Thompson, Hamilton &amp; Rust, 2005; See also Kemenade, 2018).</p><p>So if we can’t simply add or remove features, how should we think about getting consumers to buy?</p><p>The user needs to want it (motivation), they need to be able to buy it (have the ability), and be provoked into buying it (prompt). (Fogg, 2009). Ability usually isn’t the most constraining factor. If a consumer really wants to buy something, they’ll take care of any cognitive dissonance for you. E.g. “I don’t have the space for this new guitar. But damn, I really want it. Okay, I’ll just clean up the attic, and then I’ll have enough space.” (Which they won’t do). Not carrying (enough) money is also not really an issue anymore with Apple Pay and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>You could imagine a physical constraint. E.g. they wanna buy but the product is too big to take home in their car. That’s a place where you could offer some delivery service to solve for ability. E.g. Ikea or AptDeco. Or your site only accepts credit cards, which are never used in The Netherlands. In which case the user probably wouldn’t buy because it’s too much of a hassle. </p><p>Prompts aren’t perfect in 2020 but rarely do products fail because they were so amazing yet the company simply forgot to tell people about it. And pretty much the only thing marketers actually understand is CTA: Call To Action, which is just another word for prompt. So buying is primarily a motivation issue. And secondarily an …</p></div></div></div>

        <div>
                      <p><span><strong>What was the last product demo you saw?<br>
Not on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, they’re all over those, but on tv, billboards or press (does press still exist?).<br>
You just don’t see agencies doing them anymore.<br>
Odd, because, and I hope I’m not giving away any trade secrets here, the goal of most advertising is to persuade people that the product featured is good.<br>
Ideally, REALLY good.<br>
So showing it in action, performing well, seems like it might be a good way to go?<br>
Because most purchasing decisions are based on what a product does. But sometimes in ad agencies, we can get too distracted with our own fancy theories and philosophies.<br>
Not just in agencies, sometimes when I teach I’ll review work that, although clever, doesn’t feel like it’ll sell anything.<br>
It doesn’t feel like it’s trying to sell anything.<br>
Would you buy that cereal because you’re told it’s what the cool folks eat?<br>
Or a computer because the company that makes it has some very progressive social policies?<br>
Maybe.<br>
But most wouldn’t, they want to know what’s in it for them.<br>
My advice when such a situation arises is always the same; imagine you’re with a friend, face to face, how would you persuade them to buy this product?.<br>
They know they can’t waffle and bullshit friends, so they stop trying. Instead, they start thinking about why their friend may actually part with money for this product.<br>
Focussing on what it does.<br>
How it may help them.<br>
The ideas often become less grandiose and more like common-sense advice.<br>
Which is more persuasive.<br>
As the saying goes – Don’t tell me you’re funny, make me laugh.<br>
So why are we producing less product demos?<br>
Less products to warrant that type of advertising today?<br>
Would that kind of <em>‘hard sell’</em> advertising reflect badly on a brand today? Or that it would reflect badly on us?<br>
(Answers on a postcard, etc, etc.)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>p.s. &nbsp;I couldn’t help wondering if the British Government spent less money telling people what to do about Covid-19 and more on demonstrating the benefits of wearing masks and washing hands, the situation may be a bit better?</span></p>
<p><span>E.g. 1. Masks.</span></p>

<p><span><em>E.g. 2. Soap.<br>
</em></span></p>


<p><span>When I gathered together this bunch, I didn’t look through awards sites or annuals, I just tried to remember product demonstrations, ones that had stuck with me.</span><br>
<span>Consequently, there are some ads in here that I couldn’t tell you when or where they were done, like Tonka and the nail varnish ad.</span><br>
<span>But having collated all of this ‘unfashionable’ work, it dawned on me that most of it was created by the most fashionable agencies.<br>
At least, the most fashionable in their of the day.<br>
DDB, PKL, WRG, GGT, BBH, WCRS, DDB, AMV, APPLE.<br>
Written by the likes of George Lois, Roy Grace, Dave Trott, David Abbott, John Webster, Ron Collins.<br>
Maybe they knew something we don’t?</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
    <p><img src="https://yusufhegazy.com/img/bof-normies/header.png" alt="Fractal Tree"></p><h2 id="what-is-a-buffer-anyway">What is a Buffer anyway?</h2>
<p>We can think of buffers as containers to hold our data for later use, it’s not really something specific to computer science; In fact, we have buffers in electronics, mechanics, chemistry and even politics!
We can say that the word buffer is just a fancy name for a placeholder (temporary storage)!</p>
<h2 id="buffer-in-computer-science">Buffer in Computer Science</h2>
<p>Now, it’s time to get more technical and get to know buffers more in computer science!</p>
<p>Online video streaming is a pretty good application of buffering, back in the old days we would see YouTube showing that nostalgic loading bar while waiting the video to load and that’s exactly why we use buffers!
We need to store video data in someplace so that when we need that data we can load it directly from the computer’s memory since we can’t really have our internet connection playback videos in realtime without having some temporarily storage for data to reside in, and that’s the reason why livestreams never sync with realtime and have a couple seconds delay.</p>
<p>here is a more lower level representation of a buffer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#define BUFSIZE 1024
</span><span></span><span>char</span> buffer[BUFSIZE];
size_t len;

<span>// ... later
</span><span></span><span>while</span>((len<span>=</span>read(STDIN, <span>&amp;</span>buffer, BUFSIZE)) <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>)
    write(STDOUT, buffer, len);
</code></pre></div><p>This snippet basically check for data available then reads it from the standard input (command line) and writes that data back to the standard output (command line too).</p>
<h2 id="buffer-overflows">Buffer Overflows!</h2>
<p>It’s time for the good stuff now!</p>
<p>Let’s say we have an arbitrary variable of size 5 bytes, and we stored some value in that variable which <em>exceeds 5 bytes</em>, that’s a simple buffer overflow!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> someVariable[<span>5</span>];

<span>/* we are trying to copy 15 bytes to a 5 bytes sized variable */</span>
memcpy(someVariable, <span>"Hello, world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, <span>15</span>); 

printf(someVariable);
</code></pre></div><p>We encounter buffer overflows more frequently than we imagine, ever seen <code>Segmentation Fault</code> appear in your C program out of nowhere? That’s also a buffer overflow but your computer has prevented it from causing any damage and stopped the program from running.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to our 5 bytes overflown variable example. What happens to the overflown data? Where is it’s destination? Does it get lost in the void of nothingness?</p>
<p>Nope, in fact we just overwrite other data when we overflow any variable, and that’s the core of our problem. We can’t just overwrite data and act as if nothing happened. What if we overwrite important data? What if we can overwrite data related to process memory and already running programs?</p>
<p>These are all possibilities which are just a mere consequence of buffer overflows and can cause great damage to computers</p>
<h2 id="weaponizing-buffer-overflows">Weaponizing Buffer Overflows</h2>
<p>A basic technique used by hackers when exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities is determining the place where data gets overwritten and <strong>handcrafting</strong> the overflown data to inject <strong>arbitrary code</strong> in the program, imagine if that program runs at elevated privileges and a hacker takes control of it’s execution flow, you get <em>pwned.</em></p>
<p>And that’s just the basic technique in abusing buffer overflow vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="am-i-really-safe">Am I Really Safe?</h2>
<p>Sadly, yes you are safe.</p>
<p>Buffer overflows aren’t as popular in 2020 (as of writing this article) as they used to be back in the old days of computers, all modern processors/operating systems have strict rules and mitigations for all the paradigms and techniques of buffer overflows.</p>
<p>Some of these famous mitigations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ASLR</strong> (Address Space Layout Randomization)</p>
<p>Basically randomizes all the memory addresses at runtime whenever you execute any program so it makes it impossible to hardcode memory addresses for exploiting buffer overflow attacks</p>
<p>i.e: the exploit needs to be completely dynamic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NX Bit</strong></p>
<p>Basically marks areas of memory as non-executable, prevents hackers from injecting malicious code into areas of memory in an attempt to execute it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack Canaries</strong></p>
<p>Basically generates some random value in memory at runtime and checks before returning from any function if that random value got overwritten or not, if yes then program exits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are just some of the basic mitigation used in 2020.</p>
<p>But again, <em>these doesn’t really make your computer invincible</em> as much as making it just harder for an attacker to compromise your system using buffer overflow attacks.</p>
<p>Hackers still can bypass these mitigations using underhanded methods such as bruteforce and leaking addresses from memory but using these mitigations correctly can make buffer overflows nearly useless.</p>
<p>It’s also worthy to mention that buffer overflows can be prevented from the programmers side by following the coding best practices and avoiding unsanitized input etc…</p>

                    <h2>Best so far</h2>
<p>I have been writing every day for more than a month now, and it has not been apparent to me that I got any better.</p>
<p>I make mistakes when writing the first draft. I butcher some of the sentences. Hemingway wants me to change the structure of every sentence. </p>
<p>It is all the same.</p>
<p>But yesterday, I have <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/when-productivity-increases">written the best article</a> I have written so far.</p>
<p>It took much more time than usual to finish. It required me to do research. It required me to make custom images for it, but I did all of that it.</p>
<p>What really caught me off guard is that I  edited it. </p>
<p>I really hate the editing process, at least I did hate it. Ever since I started writing an actual novel book and thousands of people started reading what I write, I started feeling conscious of my mistakes.</p>
<p>Instead of just trying to finish the task straight away, I had to make sure that at least the text itself had no mistakes. I knew that it wouldn’t go in vain and people will be reading it.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of editing that I found is that you learn a lot when editing. You see the common trends in mistakes. You start to understand how you write and what mood does your writing give.</p>
<p>That has enabled me to accelerate my learning.</p>
<h2>How I started writing the blog</h2>
<p>I started with just a simple resolution, on October the 12th, to write every single day a piece of writing that others could read. It didn’t have to be long or amazingly good. It just had to be some writing.</p>
<p>That is how a person that never written anything half-decent can start writing.</p>
<h3>How I started writing a novel</h3>
<p>After around a month, I was drained reading the novels that had a thin plot and were just straight up badly written. So I had to give it a try myself. I had no experience in writing and had no idea how to write a novel either. The first chapters, expectedly, were tough to write. But after it started flowing as if it was my second nature. It became much easier to write a novel.</p>
<h2>My plan</h2>
<p>It all started with me promising to write at least 200 words per day, and now I write around 2 thousand per day. Plus all the editing. To tell you the truth, I would off never expected everything to end up like this.</p>
<p>By reading this, you might think that I am planning on going somewhere and setting myself crazy goals that I want to achieve? Well yes and no.</p>
<p>I want to achieve great goals, but setting them is not the ideal way for me to do it.</p>
<p>I want to get to the goals unexpectedly and with the habits instead of sheer motivation. </p>
<p>Ever since I started with habits, I don’t believe in motivation anymore. Motivation is best used to start habits, but in the long run, it is meaningless. You better use your motivation on starting a new habit, then forcing yourself to the next goal.</p>
<p>When I wake up in the morning, I don’t have to motivate myself to write. I just do it. It is the next thing that I do after a shower, as easy as that. This understanding enables me to occupy my head with other things that truly matter.</p>
<p>The only thing I am planning on making different is spending more time on my writing on the weekends. I can see that this area can be scaled. It can be scaled well enough actually to give a benefit to others.</p>
<p>That means that if I put extra effort into articles that will actually rank and become higher indexed on Google. Then I will also be able to get new traffic from SEO, which means I can help even more people.</p>
<p>I have to say that I really under appreciate what is happening right now with everyone being able to write. It is a blessing that I should have been using from the day I got a computer. </p>
<p>If you still haven’t started writing, then:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<p>The success of Apple Silicon M1 will be defined by how good the chip is. The success of the <em>transition</em> will be defined by <em>Rosetta 2</em>.</p>

<h3>Apple Silicon M1</h3>



<p>So Apple is migrating CPU architectures <span id="easy-footnote-1-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/mac/m1&quot;>https://www.apple.com/mac/m1</a>"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. Again. For the <em>third time</em>. Now from x86 (bought from Intel) to ARM:self-designed, baked by TSMC. We can all read up on their bombastic claims and decide if its good or not. Good performance? Good battery life? But bad for environment as nothing is repairable or upgradable? Everybody has an opinion. Mine? I personally think it’s an interesting, good move… but lets talk about something else.</p>



<h3>Rosetta of 2005</h3>



<p>Let’s draw your attention to the <em>transition</em> <em>period</em> side of things. Cast your minds back to 2005, when Apple migrated from PowerPC to x86 architecture. “How is that possible? All our software would no longer run!” – users might shout. But a key piece of technology was developed to smooth out the transition, Rosetta <span id="easy-footnote-2-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/the-brains-behind-apples-rosetta-transitive&quot;>https://www.cnet.com/news/the-brains-behind-apples-rosetta-transitive</a>"><sup>2</sup></a></span>  <span id="easy-footnote-3-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/22/how-one-of-apples-most-important-pieces-of-software-came-from-a-small-uk-startup&quot;>https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/22/how-one-of-apples-most-important-pieces-of-software-came-from-a-small-uk-startup</a>"><sup>3</sup></a></span>. It was developed by a company called Transitive, in Manchester, UK. Coincidentally, I was lucky enough to work there as well. But I joined a few years after Rosetta had been unveiled, and did not get a chance to join it’s development effort. However, for many a year Transitive remained my benchmark for an ideal workplace.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?resize=391%2C152&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="391" height="152" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?w=968&amp;ssl=1 968w, https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?resize=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?resize=768%2C298&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?w=968&amp;ssl=1 968w, https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?resize=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?resize=768%2C298&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-rosetta-pledge.jpg?resize=391%2C152&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>If you don’t know it’s there, its doing its job well</figcaption></figure>



<p>It is important to understand how really, <em>really</em> complicated that solution was. It is <em>not</em> <em>only</em> an emulator. I’ve written emulators. It wasn’t rocket science. The big brains behind the software is a real time, dynamic binary translation engine, reading in instructions from one CPU architecture, and figuring out how to produce code for another architecture altogether. Where no direct 1-to-1 mapping of such operations may even exist. Or a different amount of registers are available. Or many, many other challenges – to list most of them i would need a series of blogs. But let us review what Steve Jobs claimed in 2005:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="230" src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rosetta-1.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rosetta-1.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>– Dynamic Binary translation<br>– Runs existing Apps!<br>– Transparent to users<br>– Lightweight<br><strong><em>– Fast (<span>enough</span>)</em></strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In my humble opinion, the key take-away was the last point there. It showed that Apple (Transitive) did made it work! But they wanted to downplay user expectations. Maybe they were not 100% confident?</p>



<h3>Rosetta of 2020</h3>



<p>Now back to the future (or rather, the present). This time we have Rosetta 2. It is no longer built by Transitive, as that has been acquired by IBM back in 2008 <span id="easy-footnote-4-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-acquires-transitive&quot;>https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-acquires-transitive</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span>. But the experts are still out there, the technology has been proven, and Apple built a new one.</p>



<p>The success of Apple Silicon will be defined by how good the hardware is. The success of the transition will be defined by <em>two</em> things: how well Rosetta 2 performs, and how fast software providers distribute updated versions of their applications. Popular tech news articles will once again briefly-or-not mention Rosetta 2, most likely calling it an emulation layer. You, my dear reader, by now should guess that it is <strong>not just that</strong>. Once again, it is an amazing solution, a complicated engine to perform difficult computational tasks, solve register and memory management issues, perform as fast as possible (or better!!), never crash, and handle anything that is thrown at it. There should be no option to fail here. No place to </p>



<pre>log.error("TODO: finish this instruction translation later");</pre>



<p>So… What is special about the second version <span id="easy-footnote-5-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-36" title="<a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment?language=objc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment"><sup>5</sup></a></span>? Let’s have a quick look at Apple developer documentation.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>“If an executable contains only Intel instructions, macOS automatically launches Rosetta and begins the translation process. When translation finishes, the system launches the translated executable in place of the original. However, the translation process takes time, so users might perceive that translated apps launch or run more slowly at times,” </p></blockquote>



<p> It’s not all powerful, Apple lists instruction set extensions and things they don’t support yet: kernel extensions, hypervisors running x86 VMs, vector instructions… But it is still fascinating. Let’s take their example: your software is already ‘new’, compiled for the ARM architecture. But it has plugins you want to use, and those are not. In theory, Rosetta 2 should be able to run the whole process ‘translated’, and handle the old plugins fine. So what did Tim Apple boast about Rosetta this time?</p>

<p>Notice that key differences in the presentation. </p>



<ul><li>No longer did Apple downplay user expectations: “fast enough” vs “Fast performance”. To me it shows they have more confidence in it, and a more powerful tool at their fingertips.</li><li>Translated at install time: now that sounds cool. Does that mean, that if you attempt to install an x86 app, it is completely translated immediately, and you have a translated binary ready to go? That is generally called “static binary translation”, but has great limitations for code that is loaded dynamically.</li><li>Dynamic translation for JITs: this means they not only do static translation. They support what is called “self modifying code”, where static translation is not possible. What is the value in translating the code ahead-of-time, if the code will go and change itself?</li><li>Transparent to the user: now that does not change. It must still remain the most amazing software you will never see!</li></ul>



<p>Most likely it has a multi-layered caching/storage solution of translated code to avoid translating the same things over and over again. But note that warning in the quote above: “…the translation process takes time, so users might perceive that translated apps launch or run more slowly at times”.<br>It is important to understand this. At first launch of an app, all code is encountered for the first time. So Rosetta 2 must go instruction by instruction, decode its function, check for side effects, and produce good ARM alternatives. Then cache/store the results. Then chain those together. Now this process takes time, of course, and the application may appear to run slower. But what Apple is banking on – is that their chip is actually so good that it can offset that slowdown and in the end, it is not impossible for the application to actually – at least perceivably – run even faster than on a previous Intel based mac!</p>



<h3>So How Fast is it, anyway?</h3>



<p>Now, the first benchmarks are already pouring in. Just a quick shout-out – I have just purchased an HP Elitebook with a Ryzen 7 Pro 4750U CPU. I absolutely love it. But lets have a quick look at the first numbers arstechnica provided <span id="easy-footnote-6-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/google-chrome-is-available-as-an-apple-m1-native-app-today&quot;>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/google-chrome-is-available-as-an-apple-m1-native-app-today</a>"><sup>6</sup></a></span>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Jetstream is the broadest of the three benchmarks shown here—it combines an enormous number of JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmarks. Workloads include regex parsing, list sorting, ray tracing and (much, much) more.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>HP Elitebook Ryzen 7 4750U Google Chrome         <strong><em>129.8</em></strong></li><li><em>Apple M1 Mac Mini Google Chrome x86_64            <strong>93.1</strong></em></li></ul>



<p>.. thats a ~28 percent performance hit on a really heavy benchmark. I give it a 9 out of 10. But…</p>



<ul><li>Apple M1 Mac Mini Google Chrome M1 Native.      <strong><em>156.9</em></strong></li></ul>



<p>… Apple, your ARM chip outperforms my brand new spanking HP laptop. You really pulled a rabbit out of the hat this time.</p>







<p>Disclaimer 🙂<br>I’m not an ‘Apple fanboy’. I have never purchased Apple products myself but actually owned some. But I am a big fanboy of amazing hardware and software. Which Rosetta 2 most definitely is. As well as M1.<br></p>



<ul><li> P.S.<br>Now you will be able to run iOS apps on 4k laptop displays. What?? Is your app ready for that?

<p>I write and prefer code that fits within 80 columns in <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and other projects – and there are reasons for it. I’m a little bored by the people who respond and say that they have 400 inch monitors already and they can use them.</p>



<p>I too have multiple large high resolution screens – but writing wide code is still a bad idea! So I decided I’ll write down my reasoning once and for all!</p>

<p>There’s a reason newspapers and magazines have used narrow texts for centuries and in fact even books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length">aren’t using long lines</a>. For most humans, it is simply easier on the eyes and brain to read texts that aren’t using really long lines. This has been known for a very long time.</p>



<p>Easy-to-read code is easier to follow and understand which leads to fewer bugs and faster debugging.</p>



<h2>Side-by-side works better</h2>



<p>I <em>never</em> run windows full sized on my screens for anything except watching movies. I frequently have two or more editor windows next to each other, sometimes also with one or two extra terminal/debugger windows next to those. To make this feasible and still have the code readable, it needs to fit “wrapless” in those windows.</p>



<p>Sometimes reading a code diff is easier side-by-side and then too it is important that the two can fit next to each other nicely.</p>



<h2>Better diffs</h2>



<p>Having code grow vertically rather than horizontally is beneficial for diff, git and other tools that work on changes to files. It reduces the risk of merge conflicts and it makes the merge conflicts that still happen easier to deal with.</p>



<h2>It encourages shorter names</h2>



<p>A side effect by strictly not allowing anything beyond column 80 is that it becomes really hard to use those terribly annoying 30+ letters java-style names on functions and identifiers. A function name, and especially local ones, should be short. Having long names make them really hard to read and makes it really hard to spot the difference between the other functions with similarly long names where just a sub-word within is changed.</p>



<p>I know especially Java people object to this as they’re trained in a different culture and say that a method name should rather include a lot of details of the functionality “to help the user”, but to me that’s a weak argument as all non-trivial functions will have more functionality than what can be expressed in the name and thus the user needs to know how the function works <em>anyway.</em></p>



<p>I don’t mean 2-letter names. I mean long enough to make sense but not be ridiculous lengths. Usually within 15 letters or so.</p>



<h2>Just a few spaces per indent level</h2>



<p>To make this work, and yet allow a few indent levels, the code basically have to have small indent-levels, so I prefer to have it set to two spaces per level.</p>



<h2>Many indent levels is wrong anyway</h2>



<p>If you do a lot of indent levels it gets really hard to write code that still fits within the 80 column limit. That’s a subtle way to suggest that you should not write functions that needs or uses that many indent levels. It should then rather be split out into multiple smaller functions, where then each function won’t need that many levels!</p>



<h2>Why exactly 80?</h2>



<p>Once upon the time it was of course because terminals had that limit and these days the exact number 80 is not a must. I just happen to think that the limit has worked fine in the past and I haven’t found any compelling reason to change it since.</p>



<p>It also has to be a hard and fixed limit as if we allow a few places to go beyond the limit we end up on a slippery slope and code slowly grow wider over time – I’ve seen it happen in many projects with “soft enforcement” on code column limits.</p>



<h2>Enforced by a tool</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, we have ‘checksrc’ which will yell errors at any user trying to build code with a too long line present. This is good because then we don’t have to “waste” human efforts to point this out to contributors who offer pull requests. The tool will point out such mistakes with ruthless accuracy.</p>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>

</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

      <p> <em>Published: </em> 11/28/2020</p>

      <p>I’m not fat. There I said it, I should feel better about myself, right? Size is just a number. Right? Come on you know it’s true, size, weight and all that jazz is just a BS figure on the scale. That’s what we tell ourselves to make us feel better.</p>

<p>I’m obese, my medical BMI is 42.0. I’m 335 pounds. As Penn Jillette would say, I’m a “fat fuck”. I’m tired of being a “fat fuck” or as my wife prefers a “big guy”.</p>



<p>I’m an audiobook guy. I’m in love with Audible, she is very wonderful service to have, she reads to me every day, all day. About two weeks ago, I was bored, and she suggested Presto, a book by Penn Jillette about how he lost 100 pounds. I was bored, lazy and waiting for someone so I bought the book. Oh my gosh, the language is obscene, but the author is hilarious and entertaining. I could not put the book down. It made me want to toss the skinny white peppermint mocha and bananas in the trash…</p>

<p>Basically, Penn is a obese guy like me, well he was, he was 330 pounds at his highest. He went to the hospital for heart issues and nearly died. On a fist full of pills to keep his blood pressure less than the voltage of an outlet in Europe he embarked on a crazy, all in diet consisting of potatoes for two weeks. I like his style, he’s an all or nothing guy like me. Either give me the steak, the ice cream and the sides or give me nothing. I want to eat big; I want to live big. Moderation is bullshit as Penn would say, I would agree! I don’t do anything in moderation. If I’m going to do something, it’s all-in baby. When in Vegas last summer, I was the dipshit who went all in with a pair of kings in my hand and straight on the table; that’s me baby, not the smartest guy but hey I like to live it big.</p>

<p>I don’t do keto, I don’t do paleo, but when I do diet, I go really big, I go to Costco and literally buy everything I need to be successful on that plan, I research, I plan. It’s just like thanksgiving this year; I researched, I planned, I went to Costco and planned out each and every ingredient. I was diligent. Every doctor, health coach and fitness instructor has told me that my relationship with food is fucked up. Well, not fucked up, but bad; unhealthy. As Penn would say your life sucks if you’re taking diet advice from a Las Vegas Magician, well, Penn, my life does suck. I can’t breathe outside very well, hell, I get windy walking to the park. I’m an obese guy, I have a CPAP machine, I’m 335 pounds, I can barely do the things I want to do, basic stuff; sleep and wake rested, eat and not feel sick, go for a walk and not get winded. I’m half Penn’s age and his same weight… It’s time for a change.</p>



<p>The plan according to Penn’s buddy, Cray Ray, aka “Ray Cronise” is to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eat nothing but potatoes for two weeks. Boiled, baked, steamed, roasted; does not matter, just no salt, oil, or sugar. Plain, nothing added, no salt, no butter, no pepper, no olive oil, just a plain, boring potato. Sweet, red, yellow, gold, purple, do not be a racist pig about potatoes, eat the potato rainbow, but just potatoes. Feel free to pig out on potatoes; just no fries or chips, that’s the beautiful potato ruined by Americans</li>
  <li>Contrast showers: Humans have conquered winter &amp; cold. Therefore, in order to get back to the biologically true lifestyle we’ve grown as a species as, we need to bring back the cold. Turn down the thermostat and cycle 10 seconds hot; 30 seconds cold showers for 5 minutes. It’s brutal but the time goes by shockingly fast</li>
  <li>After two weeks on potatoes, you go to a plant based, vegan lifestyle until you hit your target weight</li>
</ol>



<p>One big thing with CrayRay and Penn is the need for a scale, the smartass of scales. On an impluse I plopped down $100 for the <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus">Withings Body + scale</a>. It’s been 10 days! 10 DAYS!!! I’m 326.4, on day 2 of the plan. In 10 days, 1 of which involving nothing but potatoes, I’ve lost 9 pounds. This is AMAZING.</p>

<p>On day 1, it’s black Friday, or sucker day of the year. Everyone piles in their car after a Thanksgiving Day hang over consisting of pie and turkey, to go buy more stuff to stuff into their garage in six months. It’s all American in style and glory. What am I do? Well, shopping for TVs on Amazon like every other fat guy scared out of his mind of COVID-19. I’m sitting on my couch waiting for the oven, 350 degrees for 45 minutes, to produce 9 potatoes. That’s right 9 potatoes, or about 1000 ish calories. Once done cooking, I scarf down one single sweet potato. It’s sweet (no shit sherlock), delicious and surprisingly moist. I like it, I chase it with 4 tiny petite potatoes and some black coffee. This diet is sure boring.</p>

<p>Lunch time rolls around and I make some food for the kiddo and thanksgiving dinner for lunch for the wife. What do I have? If you guessed potatoes, you’d win the prize! I had 2 potatoes, a red and white. It was bland, boring and good.</p>

<p>A car ride nap, so more black coffee and about 2 liters of water later, we’re sitting down to dinner. I made peanut noodles for the wife, mac and cheese with some TG leftovers for the baby. I have 3 more potatoes, a gold, a red and a sweet potato. 2 potatoes into the meal, I’m stuffed. STUFFED ON TWO POTATOES?!?!??! Yeah, I save the sweet potato for dessert and decide to count my potatoes.</p>

<p>A few days ago, while prepping for thanksgiving, I bought 10 pounds of potatoes. I thought that was a LOT of potatoes, but when I counted it out I had around 20 potatoes left. That’s enough to feed a family a four a potato a night for a week, but for a guy living on potatoes? It’s more like two days if I’m lucky, so I head to Costco.</p>

<p>I love Costco. Everything there is a deal, no matter what the idiots on Life Hacker tell you. I love their steak, their fruit and yes, I love their clothes and bedding. But potatoes, that’s where you really make off like bandits. The potatoes were on sale today too.</p>

<p>I knew to continue the diet I needed to account for 14 days of potatoes, less today and the 1.5 I had in revere; thus, I knew I need about 12 (rounding up) days of potatoes. I’m supposed to be on a calorie restricted diet of 1800 or less per day, which is helping, but to get 1800 calories a day eating just potatoes, I’d need to consume 5 POUNDS of potatoes. That’s right, every day on this thing to hit target calorie intake I’d need 5 POUNDS!?!?!? So, with 12 days needed to be shopped, a total of 60 pounds of potatoes, I headed to Costco.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of potatoes! The berries are for my son, Luke, for him to eat with yogurt and breakfast for the next two weeks. Not pictured is the bottles of the sparkling water I got to enhance my diet this week.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to see me shirtless, it’s time to close the page. My starting stats on 11/20/2020 are: 335 LBS, but the offical, diet starting stats are: 333.4 lbs, BMI of 41.7. I’ll be updating this blog with progress, but here’s to my weightloss and success.</p>

<p>I’m off to eat more potatoes!</p>

		<div>
						<p>The NYT describes “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html">The Problem of Free Speech in an Age of Disinformation</a>, and in response Hacker News commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24813749">throwaway13337</a> says, in part, “It’s not unchecked free speech. Instead, it’s unchecked curation by media and social media companies with the goal of engagement.” There’s some truth to the idea that social media companies have evolved to seek engagement, rather than truth, but I think the social media companies are reflecting a deeper human tendency. I wrote back to throwaway13337: “Try teaching non-elite undergrads, and particularly assignments that require some sense of epistemology, and you’ll discover that the vast majority of people have pretty poor personal epistemic hygiene—it’s not much required in most people, most of the time, in most jobs.”</p>
<p>From what I can tell, we evolved to form tribes, not to be “right:” Jonathan’s Haidt’s <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2012/03/25/jonathan-haidts-the-righteous-mind-and-what-were-really-arguing-about/"><em>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</em></a> deals with this topic well and at length, and I’ve not seen any substantial rebuttals of it. We don’t naturally take to tracking the question, “How do I know what I know?” Instead, we naturally seem to want to find “facts” or ideas that support our preexisting views. In the HN comment thread, someone asked for specific examples of poor undergrad epistemic hygiene, and while I’d prefer not to get super specific for reasons of privacy, I’ve had many conversations that take the following form: “How do you know article x is accurate?” “Google told me.” “How does Google work?” “I don’t know.” “What does it take to make a claim on the Internet.” “Um. A phone, I guess?” A lot of people—maybe most—will uncritically take as fact whatever happens to be served up by Google (it’s always Google and never Duck Duck Go or Bing), and most undergrads whose work I’ve read will, again uncritically, accept clickbait sites and similar as accurate. Part of the reason for this reasoning is that undergrads’s lives are minimally affected by being wrong or incomplete about some claim done in a short assignment that’s being imposed by some annoying professor toff standing between them and their degree.</p>
<p>The gap between elite information discourse and everyday information discourse, even among college students, who may be more sophisticated than their peer equivalents, is vast—so vast that I don’t think most journalists (who mostly talk to other journalists and to experts) and to other people who work with information, data, and ideas really truly understand it. We’re all living in bubbles. I don’t think I did, either, before I saw the epistemic hygiene most undergrads practice, or don’t practice. This is not a “kids these days” rant, either: many of them have never really been taught to ask themselves, “How do I know what I know?” Many have never really learned anything about the scientific method. It’s not happening much in most non-elite schools, so where are they going to get epistemic hygiene from?</p>
<p>The United States alone has 320 million people in it. Table DP02 in the Census at data.census.gov estimates that 20.3% of the population age 25 and older has a college bachelor’s degree, and 12.8% have a graduate or professional degree. Before someone objects, let me admit that a college degree is far from a perfect proxy for epistemic hygiene or general knowledge, and some high school dropouts perform much better at cognition, meta cognition, statistical reasoning, and so forth, than do some people with graduate degrees. With that said, though, a college degree is probably a decent approximation for baseline abstract reasoning skills and epistemic hygiene.</p>
<p>Almost anyone who wants a megaphone in the form of one of the many social media platforms available now has one. The number of people motivated by questions like “What is really true, and how do I discern what is really true? How do I enable myself to get countervailing data and information into my view, or worldview, or worldviews?” is not zero, again obviously, but it’s not a huge part of the population. And many very “smart” people in an IQ sense use their intelligence to build better rationalizations, rather than to seek truth (and I may be among the rationalizers: I’m not trying to exclude myself from that category).</p>
<p>Until relatively recently, almost everyone with a media megaphone had some kind of training or interest in epistemology, even they didn’t call it “epistemology.” Editors would ask, “How do you know that?” or “Who told you that?” or that sort of thing. Professors have systems that are supposed to encourage greater-than-average epistemic hygiene (these systems were not and are not perfect, and nothing I have written so far implies that they were or are).</p>
<p>Most people don’t care about the question, “How do you know what you know?” are fairly surprised if it’s asked, implicitly or explicitly. Some people are intrigued by it but most aren’t, and view questions about sources and knowledge to be a hindrance. This is less likely to be true of people who aspire to be researchers or work in other knowledge-related professions, but that describes only a small percentage of undergraduates, particularly at non-elite schools. And the “elite schools” thing drives a lot of the media discourse around education. One of the things I like about Professor X’s book <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2011/06/10/summary-judgement-in-the-basement-of-the-ivory-tower-confessions-of-an-accidental-academic-professor-x/"><em>In the Basement of the Ivory Tower</em></a> is how it functions as a corrective to that discourse.</p>
<p>For most people, floating a factually incorrect conspiracy theory online isn’t going to negatively affect their lives. If someone is a nurse and gives a patient a wrong medication or incorrect medication, that person is not going to be a nurse for long. If the nurse states or repeats a factually incorrect political or social idea online, particularly but not exclusively under a pseudonym, that nurse’s life likely won’t be affected. There’s no truth feedback loop. The same is true for someone working in, say, construction, or engineering, or many other fields. The person is free to state things that are factually incorrect, or incomplete, or misleading, and doing so isn’t going to have many negative consequences. Maybe it will have some positive consequences: one way to show that you’re really on team x is to state or repeat falsehoods that show you’re on team x, rather than on team “What is really true?”</p>
<p>I don’t want to get into daily political discourse, since that tends to raise defenses and elicit anger, but the last eight months have demonstrated many people’s problems with epistemology, and in a way that can have immediate, negative personal consequences—but not for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/26/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">Pew Research data indicate that a quarter of US adults didn’t read a book in 2018</a>; this is consistent with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/24/twilight-of-the-books">other data</a> indicating that about half of US adults read zero or one books per year. Again, yes, there are surely many individuals who read other materials and have excellent epistemic hygiene, but this is a reasonable mass proxy, given the demands that reading makes on us.</p>
<p>Many people driving the (relatively) elite discourse don’t realize how many people are not only not like them, but wildly not like them, along numerous metrics. It may also be that <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/gossip-at-scale/">we don’t know how to deal with gossip at scale</a>. Interpersonal gossip is all about personal stories, while many problems at scale are best understood through data—but the number of people deeply interested in data and data’s veracity is small. And elite discourse has some of its own possible epistemic falsehoods, or at least uncertainties, embedded within it: some of the populist rhetoric against elites is rooted in truth.</p>
<p>A surprisingly large number of freshmen don’t know the difference between fiction and nonfiction, or that novels are fiction. Not a majority, but I was surprised when I first encountered confusion around these points; I’m not any longer. I don’t think the majority of freshmen confuse fiction and nonfiction, or genres of nonfiction, but enough do for the confusion to be a noticeable pattern (modern distinctions between fiction and nonfiction only really arose, I think, during the Enlightenment and the rise of the novel in the 18th Century, although off the top of my head I don’t have a good citation for this historical point, apart perhaps from Ian Watt’s work on the novel). Maybe online systems like Twitter or Facebook allow average users to revert to an earlier mode of discourse in which the border between fiction and nonfiction is more porous, and the online systems have strong fictional components that some users don’t care to segregate.</p>
<p>We are all caught in our bubble, and the universe of people is almost unimaginably larger than the number of people in our bubble. If you got this far, you’re probably in a nerd bubble: usually, anything involving the word “epistemology” sends people to sleep or, alternately, scurrying for something like “You won’t believe what this celebrity wore/said/did” instead. Almost no one wants to consider epistemology; to do so as a hobby is rare. One person’s disinformation is another person’s teambuilding. If you think the preceding sentence is in favor of disinformation, by the way, it’s not.</p>

<p>They told me, “You have to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhThso-PE_o">this interview where Mike Tyson talks about medieval history</a>,” and so I did, and there he was at the New York Public Library in 2013 being interviewed by curator Paul Holdengräber, whose German accent strikes the American ear as both effortlessly intellectual and lightly amusing, and who would seem to have nothing in common with the face-tattooed boxer.</p>



<p><img data-attachment-id="12067" data-permalink="https://quidplura.com/2020/11/29/and-this-worlds-a-fickle-measure/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11-57-11-pm-copy/" data-orig-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" data-orig-size="1816,934" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-11-28 at 11.57.11 PM copy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=863" src="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>The two men do, in fact, find much to talk about. Their discussion is mesmerizing, because to most of us Mike Tyson is nothing but a face and fists, not a man who reflects aloud and at length about his inner life. Holdengräber prompts a reticent Tyson to narrate clips of his greatest moments in the ring, and newcomers to boxing will easily see why Tyson was such a sensation, but Iron Mike grows more animated when other matters arise.</p>



<p>Half an hour into the interview, Holdengräber says that their mutual friend, eccentric German filmmaker Werner Herzog, urged him to ask Tyson why he’s so fascinated by Clovis, the founder of the Merovingian Frankish dynasty, and Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks. Tyson’s answer, however halting, makes him come alive: </p>



<blockquote><p>I don’t know—it all comes from my insecurity from being poor, and not having enough—to be insecure, and being—yeah, that’s what it is: obscure. I never wanted to be obscure. I was born in obscurity and I never wanted to deal with that again, never wanted to be that. And they came from obscurity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tyson then narrates a capsule history of the Frankish kings. He rambles, he doesn’t get all the details right, and his mispronunciation of names marks him as an autodidact, but it’s a shame to hear the audience laugh when Holdengräber asks, “Mike, how do you know all this shit?” Whether Tyson is mapping his own experiences onto medieval history or hearing echoes of the Franks in his troubled life, the credentialed, status-conscious audience is uncomfortable with his sincere interest in a past they find trivial.</p>



<p>Yet Tyson is the real deal, a book lover not because his peer group yaks about whichever author the <em>New York Times</em> has dubbed fame’s latest love child, but because he’s hungry for ideas, for meaning, for connections across time. He speaks with undisguised emotion about Cus D’Amato, the trainer and manager who turned him into a lethal boxer. Obsessed with Nietzsche and Clausewitz, D’Amato taught Tyson to see boxing as war and war as the key to decoding the world. “That is just what I do,” Tyson explains, an attentive pupil and dutiful son. “I love war. I love the act of war. I love the players in war, the philosophy of war.”</p>



<p>Tyson is searching for more than war on the pages of the past. Having grown up amid crime and chaos and founded his life on violence, he now relies on books to make moral and ethical sense of the world:</p>



<blockquote><p>Yeah—they’re our most priceless possessions, because if you think about it, you know, a room without a book is like a body without a soul. It’s the only way that we can connect the future with the past. Without that, there’s no way that we can know about the future, and know about particularly the past, or the present, you know, that when you think about history, the value of history is not necessarily scientific but moral. By liberating our minds and deepening our sympathies and fortifying our will, we can control—pretty much history allows us to control not society but ourselves, which is a much more important thing to do, you know what I mean? And it would allow us to pretty much meet the future more so than foretell it, and for that reason alone, in order to predict the future we always have to look through the past, because very rarely does time not repeat itself, and it always will repeat itself. </p><p>I’ve heard a quote before in a book that we would be fools to think historically that the past is us in funny clothes, but the past <em><span>is</span></em> us in funny clothes, and that’s truly what it is. That’s from somebody who really said a really profound statement but he misquoted what he was saying, he must have been saying it backwards, because that’s really what the past was, it’s just us in funny clothes, in different times, that’s really what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, to hear Tyson cite <a href="http://thecampvs.com/2011/08/03/cicero-on-books-and-the-soul/">a quip inaccurately attributed to Cicero</a>, “a room without books is like a body without a soul,” is to wonder if he’s putting us on. Late in the interview, he jokes that if you quote books, you fool people into thinking you’re smart—but Tyson, for all his malapropisms and mispronunciations and odd mannerisms, <em>is</em> intelligent. He’s going round after round with big questions that  many of the ostensibly educated attendees at his book-talk don’t bother to ask.</p>



<p>When Holdengräber suggests that Tyson’s knowledge of history didn’t improve his behavior, Tyson calmly disagrees. He compares himself to the fictional Ben-Hur, a fellow athlete and celebrity who achieved glory but was doomed to be unfree until he set his priorities in order: “He may not have been famous again,” Tyson points out, “but he got his family, and that was his success.” </p>



<p>After listening to Mike Tyson—childhood criminal, devastating fighter, struggling alcoholic and recovering drug addict, convicted rapist, pop-culture eidolon—speak for an hour and a half, I still don’t quite know who he is. He may be the closest thing 21st-century America has to <a href="https://quidplura.com/2011/11/03/but-the-answers-you-seek-will-never-be-found-at-home/">a Robert E. Howard character</a>, a born barbarian who’s ignorant of social niceties but possesses earned wisdom that the civilization around him disdains. I don’t know whether he’s all in on his bookish pursuits or one slight away from again gnawing off someone’s ear. Whether he’s a good man or a bad man feels foolish to ask about a professional punch-thrower who reads Nietzsche, but Tyson looks like a <em>better</em> man, one who has perhaps searched harder for his humanity than the onlookers snickering from the safety of their library seats. What has their pride gained them? Tyson’s, by contrast, has brought him perspective, and with it the humility to admit that his story is still being written—and has been before.</p>

<p>Drivers who block electric vehicle chargers in Victoria will be fined under new road rules. </p>
<p>Non-electric vehicles, or electric cars that aren’t plugged in to the charger, face fines of $330.44 for “stopping in a parking area for electric-powered vehicles”. </p>
<p>The rules are designed to stop electric vehicle chargers, which are sparse in some parts of Australia, from being blocked by drivers looking for a convenient spot to park their internal-combustion vehicle. </p>
<p>Similar rules have been implemented in American states such as Colorado to prevent what’s known as ICEing. </p>
<div><figure><ul><li><div><figure><a data-fancybox="gallery" href="https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/3000/-/app/uploads/2020/03/electric-charging-ev-charge-electric-3.jpg" data-thumb="https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/180/-/app/uploads/2020/03/electric-charging-ev-charge-electric-3.jpg"><img alt="Victoria to fine drivers blocking EV chargers" srcset="https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/1600/-/app/uploads/2020/03/electric-charging-ev-charge-electric-3.jpg 2x, https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/800/-/app/uploads/2020/03/electric-charging-ev-charge-electric-3.jpg 1x" loading="lazy"></a></figure></div></li></ul></figure></div>
<p>Although it has brought in new rules to protect electric vehicle drivers, Victoria has also made news for <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/victoria-aiming-to-raise-30-million-per-year-from-ev-road-tax">trying to tax them</a>. </p>
<p>The state has followed <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/south-australia-plans-ev-road-user-levy-but-also-pledges-to-buy-more-electric-cars-for-its-own-fleet">South Australia</a> in committing to a&nbsp;<strong>road tax for electric vehicle</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>plug-in hybrid vehicle</strong>&nbsp;owners.</p>
<p>The tax of&nbsp;<strong>2.5 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for pure electric vehicles and&nbsp;<strong>2.0 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for plug-in hybrid vehicles was announced by the Victorian Treasurer ahead of this week’s state budget, and will come into force in July 2021.</p>
<p>An electric vehicle owner who travels&nbsp;<strong>15,000km</strong>&nbsp;per year will be charged&nbsp;<strong>$375</strong>&nbsp;on top of their annual registration fee, while plug-in hybrid owners will pay an extra&nbsp;<strong>$300</strong>&nbsp;per year.</p>
<p>Although the estimated $30 million the tax will raise annually won’t be funnelled directly into electric vehicle infrastructure, the Treasurer said $45 million will be set aside in the budget to boost take-up of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles.</p>
<div><figure><ul><li><div><figure><a data-fancybox="gallery" href="https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/3000/-/app/uploads/2020/10/mercedes-benz-EQC-charging-electric.jpg" data-thumb="https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/180/-/app/uploads/2020/10/mercedes-benz-EQC-charging-electric.jpg"><img alt="Victoria to fine drivers blocking EV chargers" srcset="https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/1600/-/app/uploads/2020/10/mercedes-benz-EQC-charging-electric.jpg 2x, https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/800/-/app/uploads/2020/10/mercedes-benz-EQC-charging-electric.jpg 1x" loading="lazy"></a></figure></div></li></ul></figure></div>
<p>Chairman of the Electric Vehicle Council of Australia, Behyad Jafari, described Victoria’s tax as a “shameful abdication of Victoria’s intention to reduce emissions”.</p>
<p>South Australia’s proposed charge will include a fixed component, similar to current registration charging, and a variable charge based on distance travelled.</p>
<p>The proposal has been widely criticised, with chief executive of the peak body for carmakers in Australia, Tony Weber, describing it as “beyond belief”.</p>
<p>“We believe this charge will make South Australia the only jurisdiction in the world that actually opposes the uptake of low and zero emission vehicles,” Mr Weber added.</p>
<p>As state governments in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales have moved to tax electric vehicle owners, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has positioned itself as the friendliest jurisdiction in the nation for EV buyers.</p>
<p>It recently announced an ambitious target to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/all-act-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2030-under-ambitious-plan">sell only zero-emissions new vehicles</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle</a> is an important result in physics, expressing a limit regarding the measurement of certain pairs of particles’ physical properties. In essence, it states that the uncertainty of any measurement of these pairs of properties at the same time has a lower bound. For example, if we’re measuring a particle’s position and velocity, and want to be more certain about the particle’s <em>position</em> (measure the position more precisely),
at some point we would inevitably start becoming less certain about the particle’s <em>velocity</em>, regardless of the measurement tools we use. This limitation doesn’t come from any technical
properties of how we measure those properties. Rather, it points to a loss of mathematical meaning as the measurements get “too precise”.</p>

<p>I believe a similar phenomenon exists in the world of research and development. It seems trivial, but too many times I’ve seen it forgotten (or ignored) when it was inconvenient.</p>

<p>Pick a random project management book or article, and you’ll probably see projects depicted as triangles representing the projects’ constraints in some form. Two of the primary constraints
would be equivalents of <em>time</em> and <em>result</em>: we know what we want, and we know when we want it. In practice we are usually not overly concerned with calculating confidence intervals
for those variables.</p>

<p>But the more <em>novel</em> a project (or subtask) is, the more inherent uncertainty it has. This means that if we’re trying to take on something that no-one in-house has experience with
(and we’re not consulting someone with experience), the error bars on <em>both</em> time and result should be quite large. And if we’re tackling something entirely new (as far as we can tell
from preliminary research), it’s almost meaningless to assign an expected value to both the project’s duration and the result. This is important because after a certain threshold, a change of scope is warranted: as a manager, at some point you stop framing the project as “I want X by Y”, and start framing it as one of either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“I want X and I don’t care how long it takes.”</li>
  <li>“I’m willing to give this project until Y, no matter the results.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course both of these framings are problematic from the business perspective. But the way I see it, assigning too-small error bars just to make a project’s premise feasible
business-wise is a risky endeavor at best.</p>

<p>Note that even when a project is not very novel, <a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html">we are not great at making practical estimates</a>. Even when we would expect uncertainty to be controlled it comes back to bite us - all the more reason to be extra-careful of underestimating it.</p>

<p>Japan's <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?id=10&amp;vm=2&amp;re=">Employment Security Act</a> requires a recruitment business to obtain a license. Failure to do so can result in imprisonment of up to a year. While I've met sleazy recruiters, sending them to prison seems a tad excessive to me. Curious about why the industry is so harshly regulated, I started digging. This took me into the seemingly dry but surprisingly interesting topic of the history of recruitment in Japan. As virtually nothing about this is written in English, I'm sharing what I found.</p>

<h2 id="japans-first-employment-agency">Japan’s first employment agency</h2>

<p>The earliest account of an employment agency in Japan comes from the mid-Seventeenth century. <a href="http://shokugyo-kyokai.or.jp/shiryou/gyouseishi/01-1.html">Keian Yamato</a> was a doctor who was sometimes asked by his patients to introduce servants or help arrange marriages. He was compensated for these introductions, and eventually this side business grew so successful that it overtook his medical practice. In 1652, he quit his job as a doctor to focus on his introduction business instead. So much so was his early fame, that early employment agencies were called “Keian” after him.</p>

<p>Keian’s agency and others got started at that point in Japanese history because the economic conditions were right for them. For an employment agency to be a viable business, there needs to be both a large supply of people seeking employment, and employers seeking labor. By mid-Seventeenth century Japan, such a market for labor was flourishing in response to a shift in Japanese society that had started with the dawn of the Edo Period, fifty years earlier.</p>

<h2 id="the-labour-market-in-the-edo-period">The labour market in the Edo Period</h2>

<p>The Edo period started in 1603 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu Tokugawa</a> officially assumed control of Japan. Before he came to power, for the last century and a half, Japan had been in a state of near-constant civil war, leading to much of the country struggling to recover from the ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>Ieyasu chose Edo, modern day Tokyo, to be the center of his government and country. Previous to this, the political and cultural center was located in western Japan, and Edo and the surrounding region had been economically underdeveloped. But Ieyasu enacted policies that encouraged the urbanization of Edo, transforming it from a small castle town with only one hundred houses to a bustling metropolis of over 250,000 people by 1650.</p>

<p>Not only did Ieyasu pursue urbanization of Edo, but his policies encouraged it throughout Japan. The government divided all of Japan into specific regions, granting each to a local Daimyo, a powerful feudal lord, who built their own castles surrounded by Samurai residences. This lead to a growth in the number of artisans and merchants, who in turn needed staff, creating new employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Further driving demand for labour was the government policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankin-k%C5%8Dtai">Sankin-kōtai</a>, which required Daimyo to alternate living between their holdings and Edo on a yearly basis, in an attempt to prevent them from gaining too much power. As it was infeasible for Daimyos to relocate their entire household to Edo, this led to a demand for temporary staff.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Edo saw a large influx of job seekers. Traditionally in Japan, the eldest son inherited everything: the family name, business, and any assets. Other children were seen as a burden, particularly for poor families. Struggling families practiced “Kuchi-berashi”, literally translated as reducing the number of mouths, where they would place their children to work elsewhere. As Edo flourished, many second sons and daughters of poor rural families journeyed there in search of employment.</p>

<p>Not only did children seek employment in Edo, but so did adults. Often these were people from farming villages who were cast out by their family, or samurai who became masterless after their leader fell in battle.</p>

<p>As these job seekers didn’t have local connections, they sought out someone who could make introductions. With the burgeoning employment market, recruiting as a profession was born in Japan.</p>

<h2 id="employment-in-the-edo-period">Employment in the Edo period</h2>

<p>Employment is a relationship where an employer pays an employee for work. While this has been one type of relationship, there are others where people perform work without receiving compensation, such as slavery or indentured servitude. In the Edo Period, the division between compensated and forced labor was ambiguous, with the term <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%89%E5%85%AC">Hōkō</a>, roughly translated as “service” or “apprenticeship”, used to refer to a wide range of employment-like relationships.</p>

<p>The most straightforward kind of Hōkō was temporary labor, where a person tended to be paid daily. Another form was a long term contract of a year or more to work for a samurai house. With this contract, they were usually paid on a monthly or yearly basis, however the salary itself was low as they were also provided room and board while working for the family.</p>

<p>Unpaid apprenticeships also fall under the term Hōkō, whereby a person would work for an artisan or merchant to learn the business. While they usually wouldn’t be directly paid for their work, the expectation was that their previous employer would sponsor their new business.</p>

<p>Children could also be placed out to work under a Hōkō agreement, where they would often learn a craft while being given food, clothes, and a place to live, but not be directly financially compensated. The parents of the children would be given what was effectively an interest free loan: they’d get a lump sum payment when the child started the apprenticeship, which they’d need to pay back when it ended.</p>

<p>While Hōkō tended to refer to agreements of fixed duration, it also encompasses a slavery-like relationship, whereby a whole family was born to serve a wealthy family for their entire life. Near the beginning of the Edo period, this form of permanent Hōkō was banned, and restricted to a fixed period instead (a maximum of 3 years in 1616, but extended it to 10 years in 1625).</p>

<h2 id="recruiter-or-human-trafficker">Recruiter or human trafficker?</h2>

<p>In modern parlance, just like there is a clear divide between employment and forced labour, there is also a clear divide between recruiters who perform employment matchmaking, and human traffickers who provide uncompensated labourers to employers. In the Edo period, the difference between these two professions was murkier than it is today.</p>

<p>For instance, when children ventured into Edo in search of employment and didn’t have any local connections, they would sometimes make use of a local recruiter. These recruiters would sign a contract on behalf of the parents with an employer. While some of these were benevolent, it was easy for them to be exploitative, and force the children to take jobs with poor working conditions.</p>

<p>During this period, the government also established special regions called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABkaku">Yukaku</a>, which became the only legal area to practice prostitution. The government saw Yukaku as a way of maintaining public order and collecting taxes. To ensure a steady stream of new prostitutes, the government allowed the “apprenticing” of young girls into prostitution. Unlike normal apprenticeships though, where the parents needed to pay back the “loan” that they received, the girl herself became responsible for paying it back. The amount the parents received was so much though, that even if the girl worked her entire life as a prostitute, she could never pay off the debt. The only way out was to have a wealthy man buy out her remaining debt, and become his mistress. Some recruiters took advantage of Yukaku, and effectively bought young girls from poor families in rural areas and sold them to brothels.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps-towards-regulation-of-recruitment">First steps towards regulation of recruitment</h2>

<p>In 1867, the Tokugawa shogunate was finally toppled, ushering in a new era in Japanese history, referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)">the Meiji period</a>. Whereas the previous government had maintained an isolationist stance, the new government embraced western technology and culture, seeking to modernize the country before it was subjugated by western powers.</p>

<p>As part of this modernization, the government abolished the strict class system that divided Japanese into Samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, declaring that everyone who had been peasants, artisans, and merchants to be equal. People who were formerly Samurai and Daimyo however were still granted a status as nobles.</p>

<p>With this move modernity, the government sought to regulate the recruiting industry. In 1872, they introduced a requirement that recruiters be licensed and have a guarantor. They also limited the fee a recruiter could receive to be a maximum of 5% of the salary of the introduced employee. This fee was paid by both the employee and employer.</p>

<h2 id="international-attempts-to-ban-private-employment-agencies">International attempts to ban private employment agencies</h2>

<p>As part of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm">the International Labour Organization (ILO)</a> was founded to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.</p>

<p>At their very first meeting in 1919, the ILO called on its members to establish free public employment agencies and move towards banning fee charging agencies. As a member of the ILO, Japan created a new law, which required municipal governments to establish public employment agencies and introduced stricter requirements for private employment agencies. While there had been 9,712 private agencies in 1926, the number dwindled to 2,541 by 1934.</p>

<p>The new regulation of the industry also saw stronger controls against unethical recruitment, such as using exaggerated or false claims to recruit people, forcing applications, recruiting women to be prostitutes, blocking applicants’ freedom, and so on.</p>

<p>In April 1938, the public employment agencies that had been operated at a local level were nationalized with a new law. This law also banned private agencies, except for some of the existing agencies, which were allowed to continue while facing even stricter regulations. Many of the private agencies who were banned merged into the national agency. The driving factor for this nationalization was not human rights though, but rather a response to a rapid increase in …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>This will be the first in a series of articles showing you how to model a public company.</p>
<p>We’re going to build a <strong>standalone model</strong> for Slack Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: WORK). A standalone model is exactly what it sounds like: a financial model for a given company without any assumed transactions (e.g., acquisition, dividend recap, etc.). Oftentimes, a standalone model is the first building block in a larger financial analysis exercise. For example, if a bank is hired to help a company review its strategic alternatives, one of the first steps is working with management to build a standalone model. The standalone model serves as the company’s <em>base case</em>, which all strategic alternatives are then compared to.</p>
<p>Likewise, public markets investors model public companies in order to project financial results and evaluate investment opportunities. For private equity investors, building a rigorously tested operating model is one of the key workstreams in any deal. Knowing how to build rock-solid standalone models is a foundational skill for investment banking, private equity, and hedge fund professionals.</p>
<p>This article will walk you through building a public market overview (PMO), which is the first step in any standalone model for a public company. A public market overview calculates a company’s equity value and enterprise value, along with basic trading multiples.</p>
<p>Future articles in this series will walk you through building the full standalone model and accompanying operating cases. This is step one.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>We recommend you start from a blank Excel workbook and try to follow the steps below. But if you prefer, here’s the <a href="https://multipleexpansion.com/excel/Slack-PMO.xlsx">completed Excel file</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-Create-Cover-Tab"><a href="#1-Create-Cover-Tab" title="1) Create Cover Tab"></a>1) Create Cover Tab</h2><p>First, we’re going to create a cover tab. Our cover tab looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/1-cover-tab.png"></p><p>A few things to point out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Below the cover area, we wrote our project code name (“WORK”) in cell F47. We’re naming this cell <code>PROJECT</code>.<blockquote>
<p>To name a cell, you press <strong>CNTL</strong> + <strong>F3</strong>. When you name a cell, you can then refer to it anywhere in the workbook using its new name (in this case, <code>PROJECT</code>).</p>
<p>Word to the wise: don’t overuse this functionality. If you have more than 10 named cells in your model, you’re doing too much.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The title in the cover area is actually a formula using our project code name. The formula is:<blockquote>
<p>=”Project “&amp;PROJECT</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Similarly, the date / timestamp below the title is created using the formula:<blockquote>
<p>=now()</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Create-PMO-Tab"><a href="#2-Create-PMO-Tab" title="2) Create PMO Tab"></a>2) Create PMO Tab</h2><p>Next, we’re going to create a new tab for our <strong>p</strong>ublic <strong>m</strong>arket <strong>o</strong>verview (PMO). Again, a public market overview calculates a company’s equity value, enterprise value, and implied trading multiples. This might sound simple, but calculating equity and enterprise values can involve a surprising degree of nuance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, let’s create a new tab. The shortcut to create a new Excel tab is <strong>SHIFT</strong> + <strong>F11</strong>.</li>
<li>Now, let’s rename the new tab <code>PMO</code>. The shortcut to rename an Excel tab is: <strong>ALT</strong> &gt; <strong>H</strong> &gt; <strong>O</strong> &gt; <strong>R</strong>.</li>
<li>Let’s apply some basic formatting to our new tab. In the upper leftmost cell, we’ll reference the project name again.<blockquote>
<p>= “Project “&amp;PROJECT</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Below the project name, let’s put a page header - in this case, “Public Market Overview (PMO)”</li>
</ul>
<p>Your new PMO tab should look like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/2-blank-pmo-tab.png"></p><h2 id="3-Add-PMO-Layout"><a href="#3-Add-PMO-Layout" title="3) Add PMO Layout"></a>3) Add PMO Layout</h2><p>Let’s add the basic structure of our PMO. Remember - we’ll be calculating equity value, enterprise value, and trading multiples for Slack. </p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate equity value for a public company?</strong> Pretty simple, we multiply the number of shares by the stock price. We’ll need (i) the stock price and (ii) the fully diluted share count.</p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate enterprise value for a public company?</strong> We take the equity value, and we add net debt. We’re already calculating the equity value (above), but we’ll need to look at Slack’s latest filings in order to determine the net debt.</p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate trading multiples?</strong> (If you really have no idea, this is not the right tutorial series for you.) We’re going to divide equity value and enterprise value, respectively, by various financial metrics for Slack, such as revenue, EBITDA, and net income. The exact metrics and multiples we use will depend on the company’s financials.</p>
<p>Here’s what the outline of your PMO should look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/3-pmo-layout.png"></p><h3 id="Stock-Based-Compensation"><a href="#Stock-Based-Compensation" title="Stock-Based Compensation"></a>Stock-Based Compensation</h3><p>You’ll notice that we’re adding options &amp; RSUs to basic shares in order to calculate the <strong>f</strong>ully <strong>d</strong>iluted <strong>s</strong>hares <strong>o</strong>utstanding (FDSO). Most public companies offer some form of stock-based compensation to employees, and options and RSUs are two common varieties. When we go through Slack’s financial statements, we may discover additional share awards, or we may find out that Slack doesn’t have options or RSUs. Ultimately, we need the fully diluted share count, so that we can calculate accurate equity and enterprise values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Some theory - why we’re focused on counting every last share…</strong><br>A company’s stock price gives us the implied equity value per share. We must assume that the market is relatively efficient. Therefore, the market is doing the same basic math as us, and knows exactly how many outstanding shares there are, including from stock-based compensation. Armed with this knowledge, the market is then giving us a price, which implicitly is the <em>most diluted</em> (lowest) value. If we don’t include all shares in our equity value calculation, we’re undervaluing the given company, because we’re multiplying the market price (reduced by share awards) by a half-baked share count.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Noncontrolling-Interest"><a href="#Noncontrolling-Interest" title="Noncontrolling Interest"></a>Noncontrolling Interest</h3><p>Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of any subsidiaries not owned by Slack. For example, if Slack bought 80% of XYZ Co three years ago, all of XYZ Co’s assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows would be included in Slack’s consolidated financials. The outstanding 20% of XYZ Co - not owned by Slack - would be included in Slack’s balance sheet as noncontrolling interest. </p>
<p>Noncontrolling interest is included as a debt-like item in the build from equity to enterprise value. It’s treated like debt, because it represents a claim on Slack’s consolidated net operating assets that is not included in Slack’s equity value. Remember, the noncontrolling interest is the portion <strong>NOT</strong> owned by Slack and, therefore, not indirectly owned by Slack’s shareholders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>More theory - what does enterprise value represent?</strong><br>This concept is often poorly explained. I’ll try to do a better job here. Enterprise value represents the aggregate value of a business, or collection of assets, irrespective of capital structure.</p>
<p>For example, when you buy a house, you fund the purchase using some combination of debt and down payment. The enterprise value for the house is the total amount of money transferred to the seller. Enterprise value ignores capital structure - it is purely a measure of aggregate value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-Searching-the-Financials"><a href="#4-Searching-the-Financials" title="4) Searching the Financials"></a>4) Searching the Financials</h2><p>Now the fun begins. Reading and searching a company’s financials deserves its own (lengthy) article series. We’ll do our best to cover the essentials below.</p>
<h3 id="SEC-Filings"><a href="#SEC-Filings" title="SEC Filings"></a>SEC Filings</h3><p>Since we’re evaluating a US-listed company (Slack), we’ll go to the SEC’s website to pull the filings. A lot of people are intimidated by the SEC website, due to its slightly clunky interface, but once you get the hang of it, it’s fast and easy. Personally, I feel more comfortable pulling filings directly from the source - and in the US, that’s EDGAR, the SEC’s filings website.</p>
<p>I never remember the website URL, so I always just google “SEC EDGAR.” The first result is the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correct link</a>. On the left side of the EDGAR webpage, you should see a search box labeled <strong>Company and Person Lookup</strong>. That’s where you enter the ticker. So let’s type in Slack’s ticker, <strong>WORK</strong>, and we’ll get going.</p>
<p>You should now be on Slack’s EDGAR page, and you should see “Slack Technologies, Inc.” at the top (here’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1764925&amp;owner=exclude" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the link</a> in case you want to double-check).</p>
<p>Filings are listed in reverse chronological order (most recent filings at the top), and the number-and-letter symbols in the leftmost column represent filing types. You’ll mainly be interested in <strong>10-K</strong>s (annual financials), <strong>10-Q</strong>s (quarterly financials), and <strong>8-K</strong>s (periodic investor updates), but here’s a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete list of filing types</a>. I wouldn’t recommend reading this list, unless you have an unanswered question. For example, if you see an unusual form code and want to know what it is, try google first. If you can’t find a succinct answer quickly, then pop open <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list</a> and <strong>CNTL</strong> + <strong>F</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks are where you’ll spend most of your time. 10-Ks provide the most comprehensive information, and they’re filed annually. You can think of 10-Qs as leaner, less filling versions of the 10-K. 10-Qs are filed quarterly. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersreada10khtm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This guide on how to read a 10-K</a>, provided by the SEC, is pretty thorough without making your eyes bleed (at least mine didn’t). If you’re new to filings research, it’s a good place to start.</p>
<p>When building a PMO, you want to locate the latest 10-Q or 10-K, which should have all of the information you need. Ideally, the latest 10-Q or 10-K will be one of the first filings listed, as is the case here (as of November 25, 2020). See below:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/4-first-10-q.png"></p><p>It’s better (for you) if the latest 10-Q / 10-K is near the top of the list, because then you have to check fewer filings to ensure nothing material has changed. Remember - 8-Ks contain investor updates, so sometimes you can run into situations, in which an important 8-K is released <em>after</em> the latest 10-Q / 10-K. By default, you should check every filing above the latest 10-Q / 10-K, and it’s also a good idea to check any 8-Ks directly below the latest 10-Q / 10-K. You don’t want to miss something important. Anyways, we’re in luck. No subsequent 8-Ks, and the latest 10-Q should have everything we need.</p>
<h3 id="10-Q-and-Exhibits"><a href="#10-Q-and-Exhibits" title="10-Q and Exhibits"></a>10-Q and Exhibits</h3><p>Let’s click on that top <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000176492520000570/0001764925-20-000570-index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-Q</a>. You should see this menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/5-latest-10-q-menu.png"></p><p>The first link in the table (here, it says “10-Q”) is the main filing. We’ll go to that in a second.</p>
<p>The exhibits listed below the filing contain various legal documents. You can ignore these unless you’re hunting for something specific. For example, the first …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Pay up -- or we’re pulling the plug. </p><p>That’s the approach the news industry should take when it comes to Google and Facebook: Pay for our journalism or we’re banning it from your platforms. </p><p>For too long, journalists have given away their stories for free in exchange for distribution by the duopoly. At best, a story may go viral (rare) or hit the SEO lottery and experience a one-off traffic surge (unsustainable). </p><p>And for that, newsrooms have willingly handed over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/media/google-news-industry-antitrust.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">billions of dollars</a> in ad revenue to the tech giants that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/">threaten</a> their very existence. (Google and Facebook are No. 1 and No. 2 <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/facebook-ad-revenue-2019-2020">ad platforms</a> in the U.S., respectively).</p><p>The news industry as a whole needs to come together and demand to be fairly compensated for their contributions. Until Facebook and Google agree to pay up, they are simply exploiting journalism under the pretext of democratizing information. </p><p>News drives habit. Habit drives frequency. And frequency drives time spent. In the attention economy (read: ad-driven), news content entices people to come back and stay in platforms’ carefully crafted ecosystems. </p><p>In short, platforms need news. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg said it himself when Facebook launched its news tab in 2019 (its most recent olive branch to publishers). In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/opinion/sunday/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-news.html">piece for the<em> New York Times</em></a>, the Facebook founder pledged to “support the news industry” and said that journalism today is “more important than ever.” But only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/23/facebook-offer-news-tab-users-pay-some-publishers-their-work/">some of the 200+ publishers</a> involved in the news tab were actually paid for their contributions. &nbsp;</p><p>These platforms are simply using their high-minded mission statements (e.g. Facebook: To “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and Google: To “organize the world’s information”) as a thuggish pretext for exploiting journalism. </p><p>Instead, they should pay a licencing fee or provide a sizable cut of ad revenue to newsrooms that are populating the platforms (Murdoch analogized this to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/22/rupert-murdoch-facebook-should-pay-news-publishers">carriage fee</a>). &nbsp;</p><p>It’s not enough for them to attempt damage control by <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/">spinning up funds</a> claiming to help journalism or offering some – but not all – publishers fees for their contributions. (If you want to know how Google really feels about paying for news, see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/google-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSL1N0TV0S520141211">how they treated publishers</a> in Spain).</p><p>That’s why we’re building <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/?utm_source=nillium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=frontpage">Forth</a>, a news-first platform that pays journalists for their work and offers the audience concise updates with context -- from the reporters they trust. All revenue generated on Forth is shared with our news partners. </p><p>We only allow trusted and credible journalists (vetted by our editorial team) to publish to the platform. It's a one-stop shop for accurate information about what's happening right now. &nbsp;</p><p>It’s one thing for Facebook and Google to out-innovate a slow-to-adapt industry -- it’s another to profit off of the same industry's work with impunity. </p><p>Newsrooms should be mad as hell -- and they don’t have to take it anymore. </p><p>Let’s Go Forth, </p><p>-- Xana</p><p><br><em>Xana O'Neill is the Co-Founder of Forth, a platform for concise updates with context from the reporters you trust.</em></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the middle of an actual, like, actual workplace coup with secret meetings, purges, puppetmasters, frame-ups, leak investigations, and (rumored) slack DM surveillance, I was listening to the bombshell podcast and heard about this book about coup-proofing, and how it ruins teams.
I picked up a copy, and this year I read it.</p>

<p>The book (Caitlin Talmadge / <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501700293/the-dictators-army">The Dictator’s Army</a>) is about how coup fears hamstrung management in two wars:
Saddam Hussein’s 8-year failed invasion of Iran, and South Vietnam’s final defense against the North.
This article is about private sector leadership lessons I took from the book.</p>

<p>Writing about private sector leadership on the eve of a plausible military coup seems like peeing into the ocean, but it’s this or doomscrolling and holding in your pee can kill you.</p>

<p>Most management books are aspirational and map out success.
This one is about repeated failure, despite great funding, first-mover advantage and better equipment, through repeated mistakes, and in the public eye.
Nothing that I would know anything about cough.</p>

<p>Startups sub 30 people have a hard time accessing experienced hires who combine domain skill and the ability to work on a team.
There are real reasons for this, and some boil down to something like Saddam’s coup fears.
But if our society plans to continue airlifting cash into small companies, onboarding good middle managers earlier can make more of these bets pay off.</p>

<p>If you prefer a soundtrack, play this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbICk05yPk">masterclass on management</a> (from GI Joe’s Cobra Commander) in the background.
It sometimes gets me through the week.</p>

<h2 id="despots-meddle">Despots meddle</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.
– JS Mill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By inference, if you’re not hiring barbarians and / or they don’t need improvement, or your team is capable of discussion, consider a lighter-weight leadership style.</p>

<p>‘Despot’ also means bronze age feudal landowners or the heir apparent of Byzantium, but we haven’t had those for a while.
Adaptive reuse of the term in revolutionary France gave the term its modern meaning:
an absolute ruler who governs without restraint by the law.
See also ‘frondeur’.</p>

<p>When growing teams take on more complex goals but don’t update their management, they encounter pathologies of delegation –
senior leadership who isn’t sure how to solve problems using middle managers, who give them the wrong length leash.
This is the 10 person to 30 person growth spurt.
Good companies outgrow it this <em>if</em> they survive.</p>

<p>Here’s what that looked like in Iraq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>decision-making at the senior levels of the Iraqi military revolved more around the fear of what Saddam might do than what the Iranians might do.<sup id="fnref:senior-fear" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:senior-fear">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>by the middle of the war, Saddam was making a serious effort to inform himself about military matters in order to understand what was happening. However, Saddam was the only decision maker,<sup id="fnref:educate" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:educate">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technocratic middle managers were spending most of their energy undoing their leader’s bad decisions, rather than fighting and winning.
There’s a spectrum between ‘own worst enemy’ and ‘annoying bandwidth bottleneck’, but new managers generally are on it somewhere.</p>

<p>Over-centralization of authority sends a message that people shouldn’t act on their own, which paralyzes your org.
Note that I’m not arguing against hierarchical authority or a clear chain of command, but rather against authority all concentrating at the top, making it impossible for middle managers to do their jobs.
In Vietnam:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>few officers who had come up in the Diem system were willing to do anything “in the absence of detailed orders.”<sup id="fnref:detailed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:detailed">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization also hamstrings the flexibility of a large team to adapt to new information.
Top leaders, often lacking domain skill or up-to-date information, are best at ‘do nothing without asking me’ orders that trap middle managers in bad positions.
In one case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Saddam had decreed that units were not allowed to cede any ground, the Iraqi defense was poorly coordinated and ineffective, eventually inducing panic.<sup id="fnref:panic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:panic">4</a></sup> …
Iraqi officers in the field lacked the authority to redeploy forward troops or to call on reserves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because the dictators aren’t an expert in any part of the organization, lack the attention to focus on everything at once, and aren’t accountable to anyone, they have zero memory.
In one case in Vietnam, President Thieu’s personal intervention not only disrupted the existing strategy, but he had forgotten by the next day that he’d given the order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudden change in orders from an uninformed Thieu was a disaster, resulting in neither a robust defense of the city nor a clean withdrawal.<sup id="fnref:sudden-change" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sudden-change">6</a></sup> … Amazingly … Hue’s abandonment apparently came as a surprise to President Thieu<sup id="fnref:abandonment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:abandonment">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unaccountable, illogical plans from inexpert leaders create hills to die on, in some cases literally.
They also come through unusual channels (because hands-on leaders prioritize fast action).
Unusual channels = coordination and preparation impossible for middle managers.
In one case in South Vietnam, a general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>personally interceded at all levels, sometimes going so far as to personally issue orders by radio to individual brigade commanders without notifying the division operations center. Both Giai and his division advisers often learned of new orders only as they were being carried out.<sup id="fnref:all-levels" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:all-levels">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By comparison, the North Vietnamese had good delegation and sane command structures in place.
From an internal document, they valued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“unanimity of thought from the top to the bottom regarding the opportunity we faced and the tactics to be employed” but significant room for commanders to execute their plans<sup id="fnref:unanimity" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unanimity">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the American revolution, George III was having a conversation with his American portraitist Benjamin West; he heard Washington was going to resign his commission and ‘return to his farm’.
The King was like ‘ha pull the other one’, recognizing that giving up power is very hard, and said something like ‘<em>if</em> he does it I take back everything I said about the guy.’
The point is that accepting the limits to authority is hard, but also critical for good leaders.</p>

<h2 id="managing-up">Managing up</h2>

<p>One of the lessons of 2020 is probably that sometimes the only person in the room who can stop a bad outcome is a middle manager,
and often they can only do it by managing up, not through direct action.</p>

<p>Middle managers are frequently in situations where their domain skills are better than senior leadership –
either because they’re technocrats with domain skills,
or because they’re dealing with the problem day-to-day and have better information, or both.</p>

<p>We still get shouted down a lot, resulting in waste:
of money, of time, of resources, of opportunities, of morale.
In a war it can be lives.</p>

<p>We speak out a few times but eventually converge to inaction as your <a href="https://danluu.com/wat/">wtfs trail off</a>.
We give up because we’re tired, but that’s not all of it:
We stop arguing because when a leader experiences argument as dissent, their reactions are unpredictable and poison the team.</p>

<p>The way around this way of thinking is to
(1) make very sure that you’re very right when you pick a fight with your boss,
(2) fight for better delegation, not just a correct decision this one time.
And (3) remember that if you succeed, things get permanently better; these are hard fights but companies need them to grow.</p>

<p>Middle managers are the only people who have the authority and connections to fight these fights.
That’s why they leak, that’s why they manage up.
The organization will fail if we don’t.
Employees depend on companies to put food on the table; you do have a moral obligation to help your employer not fail (if you can) (barring circumstances like if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU">you’ve looked at these caps recently</a>).</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/FutureDocs/status/938173926953443328">JAMA article</a> about ‘professional silence’ by doctors.
Silence is not golden when an important argument is being suppressed.</p>

<p>Senior technocrats have a surprising amount of power when they align their story and band together. For Saddam, years into the war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iraqi generals blamed Saddam’s military organizational practices for both sets of losses, raising a serious danger of overthrow from within<sup id="fnref:blame" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:blame">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because his leadership style was in conflict with their technical skills.
He punished losses in ways that deterred ground commanders from requesting backup, creating a losing cycle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saddam put great pressure on Iraqi commanders on the ground to avoid losses, which led them not to report failures. Withholding losses from reports and thus not receiving reinforcements or other support left commanders in impossible combat conditions. However, this was better than reporting their failures and suffering execution.<sup id="fnref:pressure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pressure">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The command-and-control system was incapable of transmitting the true tactical situation. Senior Iraqi officers later noted that they often got more timely information from the media than they did from their own commanders at the front.<sup id="fnref:media" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:media">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Vietnam, General Phu, a technocrat middle manager who had been brought in to fix the South Vietnamese army’s problems, tried to use his authority to salvage a bad campaign and was talked down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phu, who previously had enjoyed an excellent reputation as commander of the 1st Division, expressed grave reservations about the operation to those around him, complaining that he had done it only because of Thieu’s order<sup id="fnref:reservations" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reservations">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Thieu’s realtime intervention, leading to a bad loss, demoralized him and he was never able to lead again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thieu’s absurd order to withdraw immediately from the Central Highlands essentially caused another corps commander, General Phu, …</p></blockquote></div></article></div></div></div>
