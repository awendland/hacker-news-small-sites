  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://dmellonielet.com/images/onboarding.jpg" alt="WFH!" title="Photo by XPS on Unsplash"></p>

<p>Career moves like starting a new role are challenging, can often be unnerving, and for sure requires leveling up. <img title=":computer:" alt=":computer:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>A few months back, I accepted an offer with another business group at Intel. To me, it was a great way of exploring new opportunities within the company and experiencing another flavor of its engineering culture. This new role was a scale-up from my previous one, a lot of new areas for me to contribute, learn, and explore.</p>

<p>What helped me tackle this was defining how I onboarded in the new role. In this article, I am sharing the framework and ideas from my onboarding learnings.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding-done-right">Onboarding done right</h2>

<p>A well-defined onboarding is crucial to provide team members with the resources they need to succeed and ensure their expectations match the reality of the organization. It also clears any confusion about the role. Not having the right onboarding experience can often lead to not clearly understanding the new work environment leading to one as the wrong fit for the team.</p>

<p>Usually, onboarding has two distinct &amp; complementary components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Onboarding</strong>: Getting familiar with the company culture, vision, mission, value, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Role-specific Onboarding</strong>: Acquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to master the role effectively and efficiently.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Joining a new team brings in a plethora of information and emotions and can be quite stressful. If you are reading this as someone who needs to onboard a team member, I highly encourage taking some time to think through the prep work covering basics for onboarding. At the end of the article, I have listed some useful resources for the same.</p>

<p>The focus of this article is someone (particularly a software engineer) who will be onboarding a new role.</p>

<h2 id="the-onboarding-template-page_with_curl">The onboarding template <img title=":page_with_curl:" alt=":page_with_curl:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c3.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<h4 id="1-set-expectations-with-yourself">1. Set expectations with yourself</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.” ― Paulo Coelho <img title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important thing is setting expectations for your new role. Sure, you have done quite some assessment before accepting the offer. However, this step talks about goal setting before your first day.</p>

<h3 id="2-set-clear-expectations-with-your-manager">2. Set clear expectations with your manager</h3>

<p>Well, you have cracked the role owing to your strengths and the value you potentially bring to the team. Hence, it is vital to discuss the expectations of onboarding with your manager. A few questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you suggest I focus on for my first week and month in this team?</li>
  <li>How can I learn more about the project(s)?</li>
  <li>Is there a team ‘how-to’ document I can refer to?</li>
  <li>Who is my dedicated buddy for onboarding?</li>
  <li>What accesses a new member needs to request?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-create-a-plan">3. Create a plan</h3>

<p>Now that you have a fair idea of the expectations, chart out an onboarding plan. It helps to list out activities to not be overwhelmed and create a to-do list to cover all essential tasks.</p>

<h3 id="4-meet-with-as-many-team-members-as-to-familiarize">4. Meet with as many team members as to familiarize</h3>

<p>In the pre-covid world, face to face introductions were much easier. It’s not quite the same in a remote environment.
Make it a point to proactively reach out to as many team members/ stakeholders and set introductory 1:1s to learn about them, get a preliminary idea of the project, learn more about their preferred working times/ style, etc. This is an opportunity to get started on the technical details about the systems, projects, etc., and also provides a window into other team members’ interests.</p>

<h3 id="5-work-with-your-buddy-on-the-team">5. Work with your buddy on the team</h3>

<p>“There is no such thing as a stupid question!”</p>

<p>It can be a bit daunting to ping someone with a question that feels stupid to ask even if it is not. A dedicated buddy on the new team makes it easier to figure out the correct point of contact for your questions. A buddy can help understand communication dynamics within and across the teams, help understand the company/ team abbreviations &amp; acronyms, guide you on your tasks, etc.</p>

<h3 id="6-ask-questions-a-lot-of-them">6. Ask questions.. A lot of them</h3>

<p>Your imposter syndrome sure will not kick in until the first week or two. Maybe it won’t kick in at all. But if you are venturing out for something new, more often it does. A great tip for dealing with this is to be fearless and ask questions (<em>again..there are no stupid questions..</em>). The more you can familiarize yourself with the new team, the project, and the business, the better. It may not all make sense to you all at once but keep notes. Eventually, it will all come together.</p>

<p>It also helps to schedule regular 1:1s with members of your team and driving the agenda on things you wish to understand in the project.
Another great way to learn fast is to shadow experienced team members on tasks, understand their thought process, watch them debug issues, understand their communication style.</p>

<h3 id="7-read-the-documentation-and-code">7. Read the documentation and code</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to read the documentation and code. The information you have heard from your teammates will now start making more sense. Additionally, this will help you recognize potential improvements in the documentation/ codebase for future contributions.</p>

<h3 id="8-contribute">8. Contribute</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to do. Nothing beats the feeling of your first commit in the new project- be it a bug fix, a small feature enhancement, documentation improvements, etc. Channel your doer mindset and look for ways to make things better.</p>

<h3 id="9-seek-feedback">9. Seek feedback</h3>

<p>In a loop of continuous improvement, nothing triumphs feedback. Seek constructive feedback from your manager, your teammates on what you did better and what are your blind spots. Where can you improve as well as discuss what challenges you are facing and how can you address them?</p>

<p>Good feedback is a two-way conversation. Not only should you receive feedback but also provide it. Be open to sharing what you learned through the onboarding process, what can potentially improve for the future, how did your team members help you feel comfortable with the process, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Owning your onboarding can contribute to your success in the role and can bring joy. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" alt=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c8.png" height="20" width="20"> I hope these tips and ideas can help new engineers navigate the onboarding successfully.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum is resin&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Mastic tree found on the Greek island Chios. It's been labelled as a superfood because of its numerous health&nbsp;properties- which we'll talk about in just a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the last 5 years its popularity has skyrocketed for&nbsp;a reason no Greek farmer could have ever expected.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>It can sharpen your jawline</em></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;People are catching on to an old BodyBuilder method for building muscle in the jawline- chewing mastic gum! Because it's 10x harder than regular gum it's basically like taking your jaw to the gym.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently this is relatively well-known in Hollywood and the BodyBuilding space. Now it's&nbsp;making its way into the mainstream. More on that later. First you've got to understand where it comes from to know why it's so special:</p>

<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><em>Mastic gum from the Greek island Chios</em></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>he people of Chios have&nbsp;cultivated and harvested mastic or "Mastiha" for over 2500 years. The hot and humid climate is ideal for the 6-month, laborious process.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/mastic-gum-from-chios_0706dfc7-3e37-472b-9669-5ec2e9f92bad_480x480.jpg?v=1607283273" alt="Farmers harvesting chios resin"></p>
<p><em>Farmers harvesting Mastic on the Greek island Chios</em></p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Every 4-5 days, several&nbsp;cuts are made in the trees to slowly drain the resin. It takes roughly 15-20 days for the crystal to solidify and fall off. Because of the way it falls from the tree and it's shape, these small pieces of resin are called "Tears of Chios". The farmers then collect these small teardrops and wash them in natural spring water.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>It&nbsp;has a refreshing pine/cedar flavour.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>M</strong>astic's earliest identified uses was as chewing gum- the additional benefits were yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic producing villages&nbsp;were fortresses,&nbsp;bordered by huge walls. The only way to enter these villages was by ladder, designed to shield the resin from invaders.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre"><strong>wars were fought over mastic gum</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Ottoman rule of Chios in the 1800s, mastic was <strong>worth its weight in Gold.&nbsp;</strong>In todays gold prices that means 1 piece would cost $59.14</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily for us, it doesn't cost that much. But with its growing popularity, maybe someday it might. Let's talk about <em>why </em>it's selling out around the world:</p>



<p><strong>T</strong>he ancient Mediterraneans loved mastic and thought it had "magic" healing properties. Thanks to modern science we know today how that "magic" works. Here's the 7 main health benefits we use it for today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#dental">Aids Dental Health</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#inflammation">Anti-Inflammatory</a></strong></li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#cholesterol">Lowers Cholesterol &amp;</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;Blood Sugar</strong>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="#biotic">Anti-Biotic&nbsp;/ Anti-Fungal</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#digestion">Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#cancer">Cancer Preventative</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#asthma">Asthma Treatment</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Here's The "Magical" Ingredients (Skip If Boring)</b></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic gum is composed of several bioactive compounds responsible for its numerous health benefits. These include <em>triterpenic acids</em> (TAs) such as <em>isomasticadienolic acid</em> as well as triterpenes. These are natural antibiotics that also act as strong anti-inflammatories.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastiha naturally&nbsp;contains large percentages of organic compounds like Terpenoids, which add to its aromatic element. The main active Terpenoids include&nbsp;<em>alpha-pinene</em> (40%), <em>beta-myrcene</em>, <em>beta-pinene</em>, <em>limonene</em>, and <em>beta-caryophyllene</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Alpha-pinene</em> is also found in pines and rosemary. It's what gives Mastic a fresh pine/cedar flavor.&nbsp;As well as providing a strong woody aroma, it's also a potent topical antiseptic. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike regular chewing gums, which are</span><span>&nbsp;filled with artificial coloring and flavors, <strong>mastic gum&nbsp;is 100% natural.</strong></span></p>


<h2 id="dental"><span>1. Aids Dental Health (Prevent Cavities)</span></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>here are&nbsp;multiple studies about Mastic gum and its positive effect on dental health.&nbsp;A <span><a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/angle-orthodontist/article/77/1/124/58081/Short-term-Effect-of-Mastic-Gum-on-Salivary">2007 study</a>&nbsp;</span>found that chewing&nbsp;mastic gum may potentially help prevent teeth cavities by&nbsp;reducing bacteria in the mouth and the pH of saliva.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/Tooth-decay-diagram_b8ee88bd-931a-4d5d-b51e-ad0d796e9211_480x480.jpg?v=1607283312" alt="Diagram of tooth decay"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum has been shown to reduce the build-up of plaque</em></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;After chewing mastic gum for 15 minutes, participants in the study were found to have lower levels of&nbsp;</span><em>lactobacilli</em> and <em>S Mutans</em> in the oral cavity. The rate of bacteria levels even remained low even 2.25 hours later. This same effect was further supported by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281189/">2014 study</a></span>.</p>
<p>What this means for you is:</p>
<h3><strong>Mastic Gum Prevents Cavities And Bad Breath</strong></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There's no need to worry about chewing a random resin that came from a tree in Greece- it's recommended by dentists!</p>
<p>Just chew it&nbsp;like a regular piece of gum and chuck it when you're done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WEIRD FACT:&nbsp;</strong>you can swallow mastic gum! It can be broken down by your stomach like any other food because it's 100% natural.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="inflammation"><strong>2. Anti-Inflammatory (Heal Faster)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic's anti-inflammatory properties may help with autoimmune illness&nbsp;and chronic inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It decreases the levels of various inflammatory substances and blocks inflammatory pathways. It also aids the activation of neutrophils which is a type of white blood cell.</span></p>

<meta charset="utf-8"><br>
<h2 id="cholesterol">
<span>3.&nbsp;Lower Cholesterol &amp; Blood Sugar&nbsp;</span>(Healthier Heart)</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>O</strong>ur modern lazy-lifestyles and unnatural diet have made high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels commonplace. These two things increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Some studies suggest that chewing mastic gum could help&nbsp;restore these levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2047487315603186">2015 study</a></span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;<span>with</span>&nbsp;156 healthy individuals found that daily mastic consumption lead to lower total cholesterol levels. These results were observed after 8 weeks.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2047487315603186">2016&nbsp;study</a></span>, people who took mastic&nbsp;in some form also experienced lower blood glucose levels which are&nbsp;sometimes associated with high cholesterol levels. Mastic was found to have&nbsp;a greater effect on people who are overweight or obese.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="biotic"><strong>4. Anti-Biotic / Anti-Fungal (Good For Everything)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>B</strong>alancing our body's bacteria is a crucial function of our diet. Mastic has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that&nbsp;serve as a&nbsp;cure for several ailments.</p>

<h3>Soothing Stomach Ulcers</h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to&nbsp;help in treating symptoms of peptic ulcers (stomach ulcers).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A well-known <span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a>&nbsp;</span>conducted in 1984 on 38 people demonstrated that 1 gram of mastic gum taken daily, results in reduction of ulcer symptoms in less than 2 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>Reducing Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria In The Stomach</strong></h3>
<p><span>Helicobacter pylori bacteria infections are a major risk factor that can contribute to stomach ulcers. If left unchecked, t</span>hese bacteria&nbsp;may potentially lead to stomach cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic gum's antibacterial capabilities against&nbsp;<i><span>H. pylori </span></i>have been shown to mitigate these risks. A<span> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711309002396?via%3Dihub">study</a></span>&nbsp;from 2010, found that mastic gum destroyed&nbsp;H. pylori colonies faster than a placebo in a 14 day period.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="digestion">
<strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</strong>
</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic gum's most common use (for health purposes) throughout history has been as a cure for digestive problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One<span> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a></span> found that 1g of mastic gum a day, led to fewer stomach aches and heartburn in volunteers. If you read <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mastic+gum&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></span> reviews for Mastiha and mastic gum, you will find hundreds of cases where it has cured men and women's ulcers and digestion problems:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/amazon-review-for-mastic-gum_480x480.png?v=1607283351" alt="Amazon review of mastic gum"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum is an almost "magical" cure for stomach ulcers&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Helps Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</h3>
<p>New research presented in <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/">2015 review</a></span> suggests that mastic gum can help with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;A study conducted on 60 people with IBD found that individuals who consumed mastic in any form had&nbsp;measurable improvements in their IBD inflammation markers such as&nbsp;</span><span>decreased levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein. This was over a 3 week period.</span></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="cancer"><strong>6.&nbsp;Cancer Preventative</strong></h2>
<p><span><strong>R</strong>esearchers</span>&nbsp;are currently investigating mastic gum’s role in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer. According to a<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.21935"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2006 study</span>,</a> mastic gum can inhibit an androgen receptor that could have an effect on the development of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to weaken the function of the androgen receptor in&nbsp;these&nbsp;cancer cells. More recent<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951764/"><span>laboratory studies</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;have uncovered more about how this effect works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476564/">Research from 2017</a>&nbsp;</span>suggests that mastic&nbsp;may also help suppress the growth of tumors that can lead to colon cancer. Researchers found that mastic inhibited the increase of colon cells. It has been show to&nbsp;inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma tumors.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="asthma"><strong>7. Asthma Treatment</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum's anti-inflammatory properties may make it useful in treating<span>&nbsp;allergenic asthma</span>. This type of asthma often includes airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and airway hyper-responsiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2010-0212OC">2011 study</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;</span>on mice, mastic gum significantly inhibited eosinophilia, reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, and blocked the production of inflammatory substances. It had a positive effect on lung fluid and lung inflammation. In vitro tests found that mastic gum inhibited cells that react negatively to allergens and cause airway inflammation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These results are promising but further studies are needed to determine efficacy in human cases.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><span><strong>G</strong>enerally well-tolerated and 100% natural, mastic and&nbsp;doesn't have any major reported side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;In some rare cases, it may cause dizziness, headache, or an upset stomach. These cases are likely due to increased tension in the muscles surrounding your skull because mastic gum is so much harder than what we are accustomed to chewing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Start with a small quantity and see how your body reacts to it</strong>.&nbsp; Once you're sure there's no&nbsp;negative&nbsp;effects you can gradually increase the dose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's always possible to have an allergic reaction to something new</span><span>. So monitor how you feel and consult a doctor if you're concerned.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>You shouldn’t take mastic gum if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.</span>&nbsp;</p>

I was meeting smart engineers and learning new things. It wasn’t until my first oncall rotation that I started thinking <em>what if there’s an outage and I need to fix it?</em></p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/anxious.gif" alt="anxiety before first week of oncall"></p><p>Now, don’t get me wrong. LinkedIn has really good systems in place for monitoring/alerting, triaging issues and a very well defined process for incident response. Those are absolutely critical. And to prepare, I had shadowed our oncall the week prior and even had an experienced team member shadow me to guide and help me out, but still, I was anxious.</p><p>Here’s what I wish I had known.</p><ul><li><a href="#before-oncall-starts">Before oncall starts</a><ul><li><a href="#oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</a></li><li><a href="#organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</a><ul><li><a href="#trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</a></li><li><a href="#declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</a><ul><li><a href="#the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</a></li><li><a href="#establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</a></li><li><a href="#communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</a></li><li><a href="#provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</a><ul><li><a href="#get-help-early">Get help early</a></li><li><a href="#working-with-others">Working with others</a></li><li><a href="#video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video conferencing is your friend</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#towards-a-resolution">Towards a resolution</a><ul><li><a href="#looking-at-changes">Looking at changes</a></li><li><a href="#keep-calm-and-carry-on---one-step-at-a-time">Keep calm and carry on - one step at a time</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#learning-from-the-incident">Learning from the incident</a></li></ul><h2 id="before-oncall-starts">Before Oncall Starts</h2><h3 id="oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</h3><p>Before an oncall week starts, I talk to the person who is currently oncall to get context on any incidents that happened during the week or any weird bugs that were discovered in our stack. It gives me perspectives on issues that could be getting carried over from the previous week and any critical changes I should be aware of.
Although you can’t plan for all that happens during an oncall week, a proper handoff helps you prepare for it.</p><h3 id="organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</h3><p>As an SRE on LinkedIn’s container scheduler and deployment infrastructure team, our users are engineers at LinkedIn. We use Slack for internal communication and we have certain channels where users share issues they are experiencing with the tooling or to get our oncall’s attention. During an oncall week, I star these channels and organize my sidebar so that I can easily notice messages from our users and distinguish them from the other messages I receive. As an optional tip - I also like to mute/leave channels that I am not actively participating in to reduce clutter.</p><p>As compared to a normal week, I spend more time on Slack when I am oncall - responding to people, answering support requests, helping users with tooling. These Slack notifications can create a little bit of distraction, however, considering all our users are internal, a rise in messages on our channels can also indicate that something might be wrong with our system and our alerting hasn’t caught it yet.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/slack-pings.gif" alt="slack pings during oncall"></p><h2 id="signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</h2><h3 id="trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</h3><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/trust-but-verify-you-must.jpg" alt="trust-but-verify-you-must"></p><p><i>This is something I learned during my interview at LinkedIn and it has been very applicable in my experience since.</i></p><p>In early days of oncall and incident management, it is very common to feel as if things are on fire when any alert gets triggered. Over time, I have realized that gaining context and verifying that the alert is actually indicating an issue helps with the right next steps. It is important to distinguish signal from noise because:</p><ul><li>An alert could be non-actionable as it was recently configured with a threshold that’s making it too noisy</li><li>The monitoring stack is down and the alert is being triggered because the configuration treats a lack of data points as an issue</li><li>Your service is operating perfectly fine, however, the traffic tier routing requests to your service had an issue</li><li>Timer on a deliberately silenced alert expired and the alert started triggering</li></ul><p>I have experienced all of the above at some point in time. Now when I either receive an alert or a user reports an issue, I check our services (metrics, logs, reproduce the reported problem etc.) to verify that the issue is real.</p><h3 id="declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</h3><p>Not all actionable alerts result in an incident. To be effective at identifying the ones that do, it is extremely crucial to think about the bigger picture of mitigating the issue than be overwhelmed by the technical task of resolving the alert.</p><p>Some of the qualitative measures that help make this differentiation is to consider whether an issue requires coordinating the fix with other teams or whether the issue is impacting customers or violating an SLO. If any of the conditions are true, declare an incident. It is always better to declare an incident early in the process than waiting too long.</p><p>At LinkedIn, we have defined guidelines for all teams about what warrants an incident along with different levels of severity. This takes guesswork out of the picture, and provides a shared understanding to every team member.</p><h2 id="communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</h2><h3 id="the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</h3><p>Every incident gets a title. I didn’t realize it initially, but giving an incident a title forces one to define the problem and communicate it to the stakeholders very succinctly. When communicating to stakeholders, <strong>scoping the incident is very important</strong>. What I mean by scoping is identifying how big the impact is - which environment is impacted, is the impact limited to a region or is it global, how many customers are impacted, etc. For instance, “the login feature on the site is not working” vs “the login feature on the site is not working for traffic originating from Asia Pacific” say two very different things.</p><h3 id="establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</h3><p>We heavily rely on Slack to communicate during an incident. A dedicated slack channel helps focus all the energy and inputs from everyone in one place. It helps the incident lead collect data about symptoms that the users are experiencing and also captures a log of considered/discarded hypotheses and any changes made to the system. Once the Slack channel is created, establish an incident lead and let everyone know who is driving the incident forward.</p><p>Eslablishing explicit comms channels for reporting and identifying issues and establishing an incident lead reduce the delay in action and disambiguate any confusion.</p><h3 id="communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</h3><p>If there’s a fix you’d like to try out, let others know who are and encourage everyone to do the same. This ensures that the potential fix doesn’t make an already bad situation worse and helps catch any blind spots early. If you do end up making a change to the system after getting consensus, let others know and follow up on its effects.</p><h3 id="provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</h3><p>While working towards a resolution for the incident, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the technical details and miss to communicate an update. This leads to angry leadership and annoyed customers who have no insight into what’s happening.</p><p>An update provides visibility to the customers that the issue is being worked upon and lets the leadership identify if they can help out with anything. Depending on the severity of the incident, an update every 15-30 mins serves pretty well. The update doesn’t have to be extremely detailed, rather a brief summary describing the current state and immediate next steps is sufficient. An example update:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Our hypothesis about the memory leak checks out and we have validated the fix in the staging environment. We have pushed out the change and as soon as it goes through the CI pipeline, we’ll canary the new release, monitor metrics and promote the change after verifying the fix.</p></blockquote><h2 id="incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</h2><h3 id="get-help-early">Get help early</h3><p>In my earlier days, I used to think that it was solely my responsibility to mitigate the issue, find the root cause, and roll out the fix. If I couldn’t do it, it wouldn’t reflect well on me. In reality, incident management, like much of software development, is a very collaborative process.</p><p>One of the big differences in how I approach it now is I focus on actively pulling in other engineers who could help with debugging or resolving the issue early in the process. This change in perspective has relieved me of a lot of unnecessary stress and also made me more effective at resolving incidents.</p><p>When requesting help, be specific about the task as well as the urgency. It helps others calibrate their response and manage things they might have at hand.</p><h3 id="working-with-others">Working with others</h3><p>One of the most important things while handling incidents is working with others. Considering the multi-faceted nature of an SRE role, it’s one of the most important while underrated skills.</p><p>With multiple people involved, various possibilities get shared and one of the responsibilities of the incident lead is to guide these discussions in a productive direction while filtering out the noise. One should be cautious about going down any rabbit holes and focus on stopping the bleeding first. If there’s a probable cause, share it early - it helps rule out possibilities. And it’s okay to ask questions that seem obvious, but specific questions are more helpful.</p><p>Being fearlessly curious, and keeping an open mind enables one to consider possibilities that could be overseen otherwise. Remember, you are working together as a team on sharing and ruling out hypotheses to solve a challenging problem.</p><h3 id="video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video Conferencing is your friend</h3><p>We …</p></div></div>

<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>

This study took place from May to October in a secret lab on the third floor of LEGO&nbsp;headquarters, Legocentret. At the end of the study LEGO&nbsp;management received a report detailing programs, people, and resources needed to move into the new paradigm. LEGO&nbsp;quickly approved the plan, and SPU-Darwin was set in motion at the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>This website is the story of SPU-Darwin, of moving LEGO&nbsp;into the 21st century. I’m not sure yet how to tell that story, so it’s organized as a blog. This will allow me to present pieces of history as they come, without worrying about having to have everything set before presenting anything, and will allow me to experiment with presentations. Also, a great deal of leading edge science and engineering had to be developed, and those stories will require intense technical material, which might not appeal to everyone, and those entries will be separate from the general ones.</p>

<p>To Darwin members: the blog structure of this website is expressly designed to allow everyone to chime in with their memories. Please do that. Periodically I’ll go through the topics and concentrate them down into organized stories. It’s my hope that this path will eventually lead to an actual publication someday, like an interactive multimedia book, but we’ll worry about that later.</p>
<p>I’m not a designer, so if you’d like to contribute anything about this website design, PLEASE do so.</p>
<p>Note: only Darwin members (which is not just LEGO employees, it’s everyone who was intimately involved – this means you, SGI and Informix and DDE) will have editing access. Everyone else can email, which will be dealt with separately.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

<p>Google is the <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/">most widely-used search engine</a> in the world, and the company now offers hundreds of other services and products on top of search-based advertising. Personally, I think Google has done a great job improving search over the past two decades, but we are reaching a point where Google’s interests are colliding with offering honest search results to users.</p>
<h2 id="googles-competing-services">Google’s Competing Services</h2>
<p>All the way back in 2012, Yelp’s IPO statement cited Google as both its <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/399831-yelp-has-a-google-problem">biggest asset for gaining new users as well as its biggest competitor</a>. Because the site was the largest local business review site when it went public, it gathered much of its traffic from users who use Google to search for nearby businesses - especially those without a website or strong social media presence.</p>
<p>Since Yelp launched, Google has released its own competing review aggregator, which means that if Google wanted, they could force their results to the top of the list every time. This could effectively <em>kill</em> Yelp’s ability to get new users, and raises a lot of questions about Google’s monopoly on search and its effect on internet businesses.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phones-and-search-engines">Smart Phones and Search Engines</h2>
<p>A more recent frontier in the fight against Google is on smart phones. In 2020, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">brought a lawsuit against the search giant</a> accusing them of “anticompetitive and exclusionary practices,” related to the pressure they allegedly put on phone makers to default to their search engine.</p>
<p>Because Google owns one of the two biggest mobile operating systesm (Android), they have a lot of power to push users towards their search engine. It’s possible that this latest lawsuit could result in a large judgment against the company. A similar lawsuit <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-fines-google-51b-for-abuse-of-power">filed in the European Union in 2018</a> led Google to change the way it bundles apps on Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-wiki-model-for-search">The Wiki Model for Search</h2>
<p>As Google’s intentions to integrate search with its own services more deeply has become clear, and I’ve been considering what a non profit search engine might look like.</p>
<p>A great model to look at for guidance is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, the non-profit internet encyclopedia. Could having a crowdsourced, community-funded non-profit search engine be the way to save search engines from becoming cogs in a corporate advertising machine?</p>
<h3 id="spinning-off-a-not-for-profit-search-engine">Spinning Off a Not For Profit Search Engine</h3>
<p>Realistically, it’s not likely that a new competitor will be able to enter the search engine market and make any impact on Google’s market share. But, the US Justice Department or EU could split the company up.</p>
<p>For example, they could break Google up into multiple companies like they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">did to the telephone companies in the 1980s</a>, or Google search could be turned into a public utility. This is <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/competition/030819-antitrust-in-60-seconds-public-utility-regulation/">how electric companies became publicly supported infrastructure</a>, so it’s not impossible that it could happen again.</p>

<h3 id="how-would-a-non-profit-search-engine-work">How Would a Non Profit Search Engine Work?</h3>
<p>Essentially, a non-profit search engine would allow users to drive improvements to the algorithm by reporting bad results or collaborating on improvements.</p>
<p>I would envision a core team with many contributors - much like open-source projects hosted on Github. While the basic functionality (crawling, link-tracking, etc.) would be the same as a search engine like Google, an impartial not for profit search engine could sidestep privacy pitfalls like Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285">SPYW</a> and the aforementioned Yelp problem.</p>
<p>Of course, there is room for abuse in this system as well, but there are numerous improvements to be had in a publicly visible model like this.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-option-today">The Best Option Today</h2>
<p>The closest thing we have today is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, which is closed-source and for-profit, but does not store personal data. This gives users some of the privacy-focused features that a non profit search engine might provide, but doesn’t answer the potential for abuse or eventual monopoly.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OkT1Ljn.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search engine"></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I spent 3 months exclusively using DuckDuckGo as my search engine of choice. As a programmer, it was really challenging though. Google’s results have lots of context about my browsing behaviors, but DuckDuckGo doesn’t, so it takes a little massaging to get the results you might expect.</p>
<p>That said, DuckDuckGo did much better for non-technical search queries. For example, “watch Breaking Bad” takes you to a list of places you can watch the TV show “Breaking Bad.” The results are similar enough to Google’s that you probably wouldn’t notice the difference.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should there be a major player in the search engine market that is not for profit? Is it even necessary? Let me hear your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an important trade-off you need to make in order to be more creative: you need to be willing to <em>feel</em> less productive.</p>



<p>I say “feel” instead of “be” because productivity can be a really subjective and delusive game.</p>



<p>Even though efficiency freaks like to measure everything, what usually determines whether they were productive or not is their expectations. And those tend to be very high.</p>



<p>You should definitely work on adjusting your expectations about productivity. But, in the meantime, the best thing you can do is learn how to deal with unproductive guilt.</p>



<p>Because being more creative inevitably requires engaging in “unproductive” behaviors. Like sleeping, going for a walk (without your phone) or meditating.</p>



<p>Creativity is an unconscious and organic process. A great deal of the action happens behind the scenes. And like nature, it works on its own schedule.</p>



<p>You can foster and nurture creativity. But you can’t rush it.</p>



<p>Your mind needs time and space to chew experiences and information, process them, and make novel, interesting connections.</p>



<p>“Productive” people call it procrastination. For creatives, it is the making of a new idea.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.

Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Economist Noah Smith <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/climate-change-isnt-that-hard">is fed up with</a> generic critiques of technological “solutionism,” specifically what he calls the “2010s consensus that technology is a sideshow compared to social movements.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the last decade, we’ve basically been taught to deride “solutionism” — while Silicon Valley techbros were bending their genius toward figuring out ways to sell more ads or lower taxi drivers’ wages, inequality was running rampant and parents were struggling to feed their kids. Instead of trusting wizardry to solve the world’s problems, we were supposed to place our faith in politics, in mass action, and in cultural change.</p>

  <p>Except then consider what happened with COVID. Our leaders failed to fight the virus effectively, and the President actively sabotaged containment efforts. Culturally, we screeched our heads off about masks and herd immunity and “just the flu” and beach parties and school closings and bar closings and restaurant closings and dorm closings and so on and so forth. We didn’t implement strict lockdowns and we protested against lockdowns and we didn’t even obey the half-assed lockdowns we did implement. We became one of the planet’s worst-hit countries, despite having the planet’s most expensive health care system. We died in the red states, we died in the blue states. We died in droves, in hundreds of thousands. Collectively, as a society, we wrung our hands and ran in circles and screeched and died and screeched and died and screeched and died until scientists made vaccines against the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? In some ways, Smith stacks the deck in his favor. Scientific breakthroughs on vaccines can be produced by small groups of experts insulated from public pressure and the clown show of 21st century American politics. This was never the case with non-pharmaceutical interventions, even if I share Smith’s sense out of outrage and horror over America’s failed response to COVID.</p>

<p>Comparing them is a little akin to comparing World War II’s military-technical research achievements to the great campaigns of Europe and the Pacific War. The latter required extensive political and organizational coordination on a hitherto unprecedented scale, and buy-in from millions of ordinary people. The former were not exactly a bunch of eggheads in a seminar room, but they represent at least crudely processes that are largely autonomous from the need to attain large-scale consensus and cooperation.</p>

<p>Come next year, when we enter into the challenge of rolling out vaccines while preserving basic social distancing measures, we will get a reminder of how different these two kinds of activities are. I’m more optimistic that next year will be significantly better than 2020 was, but only guardedly. However, Smith is also on to something larger when he notes the dubious framing of how the answer to engineering our way to nirvana is supposed to be large-scale political and cultural change driven by mass popular mobilization.</p>

<p>‘Political solution’ in this framing seems to be a euphemism for either a deliberative process that harmonizes competing views or (more often) the imposition of one’s will on the body politic via political struggle. Neither look particularly promising in a polarized society in which merely putting on a piece of cloth held together with string has become a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/">partisan issue</a>. Moreover, Smith <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-17/california-is-back-on-the-brink-of-being-a-failed-state">observes elsewhere</a> that even in my home state of California – where GOP opposition has been virtually eradicated – single-party dominance has failed to resolve basic governance issues.</p>

<p>Certainly most thoughtful critics of techno-determinism likely will say that they aren’t categorically against the use of technology, but rather criticize a particular mindset that uncritically postulates that objective solutions can be discovered to objectively framed problems and then objectively implemented and accepted by a mostly cooperative public. However, it is hard to tell if they are talking about the technologists or themselves when they make this criticism. Statements like “if only we had the political will” to do something of interest are just as naive as “if only we had the right app.”</p>

<p>Technologists are often criticized for wanting to ‘route around’ the US political system, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/">given</a> low institutional trust and increasingly low interpersonal trust, it is difficult to be entirely critical of that desire. The biggest problem with it is that it often devolves into fantasies of taking one’s toys and exiting into an autonomous space free of the need to gain mass consensus (seasteading!) or instituting impersonal mechanisms that suppress political resistance (make the AI president!) There are idiots. Look around. But we’re all idiots in some shape or form and we’re stuck with each other. What do we do next?</p>

<p>First, somewhat of a meta-point: indirection often is a very underrated way of creating change. Part of what this post is looking to encourage is something I sometimes refer to as the “Andrew Marshall style” of change. For decades, Marshall headed up the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the United States Department of Defense. Most people interested in defense and strategy, including yours truly, have in some way directly or indirectly benefited from ONA and its projects. But Marshall did so largely below the radar.</p>

<p>Demanding only autonomy, a tiny (by Pentagon standards) budget, a small office, and the freedom to report directly to the Secretary of Defense, Marshall at first glance took a rather counter-intuitive approach. But this was actually critical to his success. He was not a threat to other people’s bureaucratic rice bowls. But he preserved his own autonomy. And by slowly building up a network of relationships and becoming a hub for innovative work, ONA ended up exercising a profound influence on American national security and defense.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Marshall’s success is that he propagated his particular institutional relationships forward through decades of changing political, economic, and bureaucratic turmoil while slowly altering the surrounding environment around him. It would be ridiculous to assert that Marshall is singularly responsible for any particular major shift in American national security and defense, but it is also very evident that ONA’s presence and persistence changed the boundary conditions of the US defense and security system.</p>

<p>While many technologists often valorize another Cold War American defense icon – John Boyd – Marshall is also a model worth emulating. Technology is complicated, frustrating, and more often than not disappointing relative to our ambitions. But it can change the boundary conditions of problems. Tweaking the boundary conditions of problems is a big part of how meaningful change can happen overall.</p>

<p>Getting 2-3 promising vaccines in under a year is a great example. Vaccines do not change the massive amount of political and institutional failures America has experienced since the COVID-19 outbreak began. However, consider the alternative world without vaccines that we were in only a short time ago. We had all of those problems but without any kind of roadmap as to how we might escape them. Now we have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/11/15/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus/?sh=3f66c9d936ed">hazy but nonetheless meaningful</a> idea of how long it could take to get back to normal, even if there is no really coherent shared idea of ‘normality.’ This is worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Even without a vaccine, we would be much worse off than we are now if everything from the physical network backbone to distributed work solutions did not perform well under significant stress. The Internet, also created originally in part for the purpose of scientific collaboration, enabled scientific researchers around the world to work together at breakneck speed to learn as much as possible about a novel virus and figure out how to attack it. Outside of the US and most <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lessons-from-taiwans-experience-with-covid-19/">successfully in Taiwan</a>, governments have also found success in working together with the private sector to manage information flows during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beyond COVID, what might this mean? Even in the best of times, the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">most</a> we can often accomplish on the most intractable social problems is to <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">muddle through</a>. They have <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">no inherent point</a> at which they officially stop being problems, and often no inherently correct shared framing. It doesn’t mean that action is pointless, but true students of politics often understand that politics is a secular activity instead of a means of bringing about religious salvation.</p>

<p>It seems unwise to stake our hopes on some kind of decisive reckoning at which political solutions will somehow materialize and then be imposed on our friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Much for the same reason that many of us find that we cannot get even members of our own family to take sensible COVID precautions no matter how much we plead, cajole, and threaten them. Still, we have also seen what happens when we simply stand still and do nothing.</p>

<p>“Techno-scientific” changes in the surrounding environment can do a number of salient things. They can provide tools we did not have before to mitigate problems. They can subtly influence or even shift the dynamics of particular interpersonal and institutional relationships and interactions. New frontiers to explore can distract people that otherwise would make trouble, and a bigger pie can make people feel more generous than they otherwise would be. While much has been made of the costs of technological disruption, breaking up established social hierarchies can be necessary for the system as a whole to survive and grow.</p>

<p>Preventing stasis and injecting more slack into the system are both means to the same end: propagating the system forward into the future. So technological “solutionism” (a term I have always disliked due to its imprecision), is both more and less important than ever. It certainly falls short of the hopes of its biggest boosters and the fears of its opponents. But if you are a technologist looking to make a difference now is as good of a …</p></div></div>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">"The new normal" has become part of our lexicon this year, in all areas of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">Will it become "normal" to wear masks during flu season? Will companies determine that workers are just as productive from home and fully embrace remote work? Will consumers permanently close the door on shopping at brick-and-mortar stores in favor of ordering groceries and supplies online?</p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">To investigate the means through which these shifts could happen—and the likelihood that they will—we identified three main ways the coronavirus could shape the economy long after the pandemic has subsided:</p>
<ul data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">Habits</span>&nbsp;</strong>could evolve, causing lasting change in consumer behaviour. As an example of the impact of habits, consider the rise of recycling in the United States over the past several decades. This shift was due in part to the advent of Earth Day in 1970 and the nationwide campaign encouraging Americans to "reduce, reuse, recycle."&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/2015_smm_msw_factsheet_07242018_fnl_508_002.pdf" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">The Environmental Protection Agency</a>&nbsp;reported that 34.7% of municipal solid waste was recycled in 2015, as compared with 6.6% in 1970.</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">Fear</span>&nbsp;</strong>can make consumers reluctant to engage in certain activities—in this case, fear of the next pandemic (including a COVID-19 resurgence).&nbsp;An instance where fear led to consumer shifts is when research in the 1960s demonstrated the health risks of smoking cigarettes. This led to a permanent reduction in cigarette sales—approximately 42% of U.S. adults smoked in 1964, compared with approximately 19% in 2011.</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong>Sunk costs</strong>, or costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recouped, could change the long-term plans of consumers and firms. A classic example of sunk costs is the Concorde. British and French manufacturers poured such exorbitant sums into developing the aircraft in the 1950s and 1960s that the jet never became profitable over the decades it was commercially available. (This was such a notorious incident that the sunk-cost fallacy is sometimes&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03909-005" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">also referred to as the Concorde fallacy</a>.)<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">We explored these three avenues to try to understand what the world could be like after COVID-19. To get a sense of how they've taken shape in the past, and what this could mean for the present moment, we considered five historical events that we believe are comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
<ul data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="">World War II and rationing</li>

<div data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><p><span>Habits have evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of social distancing concerns, as many people have cut back on normal activities such as eating at restaurants, traveling by air, attending large events, and shopping at physical stores.</span></p><p><span>Will this short-term shift in habits lead to long-term changes in consumer behaviour? Companies and industries impacted by this reduction in demand are&nbsp;</span><a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1003476/33-undervalued-stocks-for-the-fourth-quarter" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">underperforming in the market</a><span>, implying that investors think it will.</span></p><p><span>Many of the industries shaped by changes in habits are the same ones that could be impacted by fear of the next pandemic or a COVID-19 resurgence. It's difficult to predict how this fear will shape consumer behaviour—especially once an effective vaccine is developed and distributed—but awareness around the possibility of another pandemic may linger in people's minds. While the odds that anyone will continue to avoid eating in a restaurant because of that risk seem low, it's possible that fear may remain around the largest and densest kinds of social gatherings (such as public transit or air travel).</span></p><p><span>There's also the matter of sunk costs, which are probably the least intuitive and least discussed of the three concepts. Essentially, the pandemic has forced consumers and firms to incur costs they otherwise would not have; for instance, purchasing home office equipment to facilitate remote working. Once the pandemic is over, the impetus for the purchase decision will have disappeared, but people will still have the home office equipment, so working from home will continue to be marginally more attractive.</span></p><p><span>Sunk costs can also come in other, nonmonetary forms, like time. Consider that the surge in working from home has required extensive time on the part of managers, as they've needed to craft work-from-home capabilities, such as drawing up policies and learning the best ways to communicate with remote workers. This may not have been considered a valuable use of their time before the pandemic, but now that firms have been forced to incur this cost, the issue is no longer relevant, and the necessary work-from-home systems are in place.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, consumers also have limited amounts of time. When people turned to shopping online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores because of social distancing, previously reluctant consumers acclimated themselves to e-commerce out of necessity. Now that they've gotten more comfortable with shopping online, they might continue to do so out of convenience long after the pandemic.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">How Do Extreme Shocks Drive Long-Term Economic Behaviour?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>To better understand how the world might look different after COVID-19, we used these three concepts in our analysis of the five analogous historical episodes that had a significant short-term impact on consumer behaviour.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below maps out the degree to which each of these episodes led to fundamental long-term changes in economic behaviour, based on these three means.</span></p></div>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>Altogether, our analysis of these historical episodes indicates that there's, at best, modest support for the idea that COVID-19 will affect long-term consumer habits.</span><p><span>Each of these shocks had some impact on short-term consumer behaviour, but more often than not, habits eventually reverted to more closely resemble previous behaviours and fear subsided sooner or later. Though each episode was unique, we note that sunk costs were the means through which a longer-term impact most frequently occurred.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">The Economic Impact of Food Rationing During World War II</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Residents of the United Kingdom were subject to rationing of some combination of petrol, meat, fish, cheese, and more between 1939 and 1954. The island nation imports approximately 70% of its food and was therefore exposed to massive supply-chain disruption as a result of World War II. The rationing continued after the war as the U.K. redistributed food and resources to war-devastated countries under British control.</span></p><p><span>Did this period of deprivation have a lasting impact on consumer behaviour? The fact that it lasted for so long makes the possibility of permanent change seem more likely.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows the sharp negative impact that rationing had on the demand for key food items. At their respective troughs, per capita meat consumption declined as much as 32%, fat (butter, margarine, and others) 21%, sugar 35%, and eggs 64%.</span></p></span></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208%202.PNG" alt="U.K. Rationing" width="1142" height="741"></span></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>However, Britons clearly didn't get accustomed to these austere eating habits. Food consumption rebounded in the early 1950s as rationing was relaxed, and by the mid-1950s, consumption of meat, fat, sugar, and eggs was far in excess of prewar levels.</span><p><span>Therefore, wartime rationing didn't have a noticeable long-term economic impact; in general, our analysis shows that demand for rationed goods fully recovered after the war.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">Did World War II Advance the Rise of Women in the Workforce?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Also during World War II, the number of men off at war and wartime production needs led to a spike in the number of women working outside the home. These catalysts didn't last—the men came home, and those elevated wartime production levels died down—but did this episode play a role in the continued rise of women in the workforce?</span></p><p><span>Habit may have played a role in this shift as both women and their families became more accustomed to their working. Sunk costs also had some importance as firms needed to experiment with employing more women—and, by all accounts, this experiment was successful in terms of productivity.</span></p><p><span>But overall, we believe the movement toward greater female labor force participation during the war had only a modest impact on the long-term trend. The fact is that female labor participation in the U.S. was already on the rise, and the 1940s hardly stand out in terms of the trend's longer-term adoption.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows that the increase during the 1940s tracks with that of other decades—about 6 percentage points, right in line with the average decade from 1930 to 1990.</span></p></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">One could argue that the fast growth in the decades after the 1940s was jump-started by the war, but we think other factors were more important. For instance, economists have proposed the importance of:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"I don't think that this could ever create something that I wouldn't mute" </p><p><em>- Voxel, laying down the hard truths about music generation in general and my music generator in specific</em></p></blockquote><p>In groovelet32.exe, I’d like for the art assets to be capable of wiggling and booping in time with the music. </p><p>That’s seemingly simple sounding, but that simple idea contains, uh, <em>multitudes</em>.</p><p>This can be accomplished in one of a few different ways: </p><ol><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe the music whole into the execution environment and play the music with locally available music generation tools (Tone.js in JavaScript, Helm or wwise in Unity) </p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe important moments in written music into software language, have instrument hits trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, use automated analysis (Koreographer in Unity) to guess when dynamics are occcuring in the music and use those to trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using midi engine to drive effects. </p></li><li><p>Generate music entirely in place, have instrument hits directly trigger effects.</p></li></ol><p>Each strategy has its ups and downs. Notably, the first four strategies start with the simple-sounding but imposing “buy, commission, or write music”. Buying music - well, it’s hard to build a whole game around stock music - especially if music is as fundamental to the experience as it should be in a game about musical robots. </p><p>Commissioning music is simply too expensive, if I’m planning on paying my composer fairly (which I would be, if I had any money).</p><p>Writing music on my own would imply a strong upgrade in my own personal music production skills, because currently I’m operating at somewhere near the “Three Blind Mice” level. A number of my family members are talented musically - my younger brother married into a “music teacher” family - but I don’t think any of them have ever cracked open a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>, and they’re pretty busy with their own lives, so that’s a hard tree to shake and expect that video-game ready tunes will fall out.</p><p>So that leaves me with <strong>procedurally generated music</strong>. It’s perhaps naive to think that I, a person who can’t even write a regular song, could build a computer that could write music for me, but hey - if I’m good at anything¹ , it’s programming.</p><h2>A Basic Architecture for Procgen Music</h2><p>Some time back, I watched this inspiring JSConf talk: </p><p id="youtube2-_0ij8vY2gzE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_0ij8vY2gzE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0ij8vY2gzE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p><em>so cool</em></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> “we built a tool called <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce">Magenta.js</a> that allows you to tensorflow up some tunes”</p><p>I like tensorflow! I like tunes!</p><p>Setting upon the task with some zeal I managed to get Magenta.js generating tunes, slowly. I had a simple plan for how I would take slowly-generated 8-second tunes and convert them into longer songs:</p><ol><li><p>Have a background server process generate 8-second three-part-tune clips</p></li><li><p>Use some basic heuristics to guess at the key signature (“C# major”) of the clips, evaluate their intensity (lots of drum hits? loads of notes?) and save them in a huge clip database.</p></li><li><p>Create a search interface for the clip database.</p></li><li><p>Have the client request clips from the server in a specific key and intensity.</p></li><li><p>Weave two or three clips together, repeating them a couple of times, to make a full “song”.</p></li><li><p>Add tools to control the requested key signature, intensity, and change instrument, tempo, and what-have-you at the last second.</p></li><li><p>Take the output and make it sound like real human music that people would listen to on purpose.</p></li></ol><p>Now, there are some definite problems with this scheme. One of them is <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> - an unbelievably powerful synth workbench written for people who have read<a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/"> the entire book on Digital Signal Processing</a>, and <em>no other people</em>.</p><p>I actually took and passed a senior-level course in DSP for music generation, some 12 years ago. I have less of an excuse than the average person to be absolutely garbage at attaching oscillators to things. I’m still garbage, mind you, I just have less of an excuse.</p><p>Anyways, after some serious effort, I got steps 1-6 working.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Look at that! Sliders! Tempo! Intensity! Configurable per-channel instruments and levels! </p><div><p>Here’s the first song that ever sounded remotely passable, produced by the system.</p><p>It’s… <em>okay</em>, right? Not <em>bad</em>. That’s where the system was a year ago.</p></div><p>Here’s another song from just a few days ago: </p><div><p>Admittedly, I haven’t been working on the procgen engine for that entire year, but it hasn’t evolved much in the interim, huh?</p><p>I figured I might be able to shape the musicality of the output with simple heuristic rules and adjustments and embellishments, but - I can’t. An extremely talented musician/producer might be able to, but as we’ve established, I’m worse at finding C than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCr91EwGGxk">the salty pirates of landlocked Saskatchewan</a>. </p></div><p>Most of my clever changes would make the output sound better… some of the time. And worse, some of the time. Sometimes, rarely, the system produces something that, if you weren’t paying a terrible lot of attention, you might confuse for real music. A lot of the time it produces something bland and amusical. About as often it produces something <em>actively unpleasant</em>.</p><p>One idea I’ve had is building an underlying voting system to try to clear “bad” tunes out of the system - if my music generation system is actually powered by a thousand clips that sound pretty good under most any circumstances because all of the ones that sound bad have been downvoted out of existence, well, that’s one way of doing things.</p><p>But even at it’s best, the output isn’t… terribly good. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:577,&quot;width&quot;:534,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>And a big part of the problem is just that composing music is <em>hard</em>. If you take the simplest musical style that you can think of, there’s someone online explaining in painful detail that the soundtrack to Fart Chalice IV <em>actually</em> takes advantage of phrygian pentameter and post-modern phrasing to create artificial dissonance between the fourth and sixteenth notes in an alternating jazz-inspired progression.</p><p>I can just <em>barely</em> read music. I can’t deal with that! </p></div><p>There isn’t a simple set of rules for what will sound good when music is involved - people are too different from one another. There are dozens of conflicting sets of rules, and because there are so many ways to break those rules and still have music come out sounding good (or follow the rules and still have music come out sounding bad) a lot of music theory isn’t so much “helpful guidelines” as it is “endless taxonomy”, and most of that taxonomy has been compiled over the last 500 years by mostly Germans and Italians.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125325,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>I am literally more afraid of music theory than digital signal processing.</em></p><h2>The Many Flaws of Procedural Generation</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:331,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41426,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I love this book.

Infinite content - even infinite bland content, is still <em>infinite</em>. This is why people still go to buffet restaurants - unlimited bad food is still pretty compelling. </p><p>So, some of the problems of procgen:</p><ul><li><p>If you restrict the output-space too aggressively, your procgen output will feel bland and samey. <em>When I restricted the output of my music generator using too many Music Theory rules, it could only produce like, 6 different songs, which all felt very bland and similar.</em></p></li><li><p>If you don’t restrict the output-space enough, your output will feel formless and unfair. <em>When I turned off the Music Theory rules, the amount of garbage output got out of control.</em></p></li><li><p>In order to produce procedurally generated output that’s meaningful, you must understand the problem space very well, and work hard at crafting intelligent rules.</p></li><li><p>It is orders of magnitude more work than just making good output.</p></li></ul><p>Or, to put it bluntly, “<strong>don’t try to procedurally generate something that you can’t already create, dummy</strong>”.</p><p>If I play with the generator long enough, I hit little patches of vaguely almost-listenable music, but most of the time the output is more of a formless mush:</p><p>Even worse, after listening to it for long stretches of time, I’d manage to convince myself that <strong>maybe I actually had something good on my hands</strong> - usually it would take either playing it for Voxel, who <em>knows what music is supposed to sound like</em> - or listening to some actual human-generated music on my own, to remind me that I had been listening to a droning mess of nothing for several consecutive hours and it was starting to melt my brain into a puddle.</p><h2>So, You’re Giving Up, Then?</h2><p>Yeah - maybe not permanently, but sometimes it’s important to know when to throw in the towel.

            I wonder why Java was so respected and JS was not? Why/how was Java already seen as such a stable and mature language? </p><p>   Not just Java, other languages (like python) were also released around/near 95, and also seemed to get to "mature" respect status. much quicker.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I bring all this up because my impression of Java in 98 was that it had been around "forever" (as had C++ first developed in 79, but not standardized until 98!), but that's not. true at all. These were all new languages around the same time.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I'm sure the language designs had different merits, and the target applications meant a different perception and reception, but... </p><p>   it sure seems like the industry (and academics) just decided Java and C++ were the stable mature ones and langs like JS were toys.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>

              </a><p>

            
            BTW, before you assume JS was nascent/immature b/c the web wasn't much of a thing yet, remember that JS was actually released as LiveScript on the server before it was released in a browser. So "server-side JS" was always part of the story, not just Node 15 years later in 2009.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            Why didn't "we" push JS on the server the way Java and C++ were pushed in that space? </p><p>   Why wouldn't a university consider teaching JS alongside Java and C++ (and python), given they were all roughly the same age?
            

            

            </p></div>

            My point is, technologies and ideas don't always win on merits the way we hope/claim. More often than we admit, we just pick winners based on less tangible things like marketing.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>
	      <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1335216360473980933" target="_blank">
              
              </a><p>

            
            There's a lot of tech (frameworks, tools, etc) floating around that are just as mature/stable/useful as the hyped bandwagon stuff, just without the huge community, fancy logos, conferences, and big corporate backers. </p><p>   They're the "Java" and "C++" of today. They've been chosen.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            Through a variety of intentional and accidental effects (like marketing), they're the "winners" right now.  </p><p>   But a lot of equally worthy candidates are floating around waiting for their moment (which may or may not ever come).

                     November is here, and that means a massive shift is coming. And by "massive" I am of course referring to the redefinition of the kilogram unit of mass that the world has been building up to for more than 100 years. Let me explain:


            
            </p><div>
              <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dq77jBmUcAAj48k.jpg">
              </p>
            </div>
            

            
            
            
            

            <p>
              1/ I've had an unhealthy fascination with metrology (the study of measurement) ever since my 2nd year as a physics major when I took a class devoted to duplicating historic physics experiments, so please indulge me for going into heavy detail (get it?) about the kilogram.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              2/ So what actually *defines* a unit of measurement? If you're American, you probably know a mile is 5280 feet and a foot is 12 inches and an inch is 2.54 centimeters etc. But where does this chain of definitions end? Is it turtles all the way down?
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              3/ It's actually not! For all units (even the imperial units used in America) the answers all end with the Système International (SI) unit definitions established and maintained for over 100 years by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIMP) in France.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              4/ At the base of this tower are the SI base units. Just 7 SI base units define every other unit in existence. They are:</p><p>Kilogram, kg (mass)<br>Meter, m (distance)<br>Second, s (time)<br>Kelvin, K (temp)<br>Ampere, A (electric current)<br>Candela, cd (luminous intensity)<br>Mole, mol (quantity)

                     Observing the public conversation around FB, and the private ones happening among techies and ex-FBers, I think the mutual misunderstanding is worse than when I set out two years (and 500 pages) ago to (in a small way) bridge that gulf. </p><p>We're basically fucked.


            

            
            
            
            

            </p><p>
              The tech world has gotten so huge, self-reinforcing, and insulated from reality they can no longer even vaguely look at themselves (and their actions) as others do. They just live on a different planet than most people.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              Conversely, the average tech consumer doesn't understand the technology that has slowly taken over their lives, and their designated emissaries to figure it out--politicians, pundits, regulators, journalists--understand it barely better than they do, and have their own agendas.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              To say more than generalities for a moment, here's what I think is likely the core problem. </p><p>Techies take weird, improbable visions, and make them realities: some BS pitch deck to a VC, mixed with money and people, really does turn into some novel thing.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              Most people work inside a legacy industry that's evolved that way over time (usually for good reasons), and they think about the future via some analogy with their present (which is a function of a long-ago past). The interruption that tech will introduce is often hard to grasp.

Its no secret you will find many articles on the web proclaiming how good Golang is, and its always been something I wanted to try out.</p><p>Until now I haven’t really had a use case and I feel its always much better to have a “need” to use something to really evaluate it, or your stuck just running through hello world’s and tutorials where your doing little more than copy/pasting working code.</p><p>The project in question is almost ready for a big reveal, but for the purposes of this article lets just say I needed a binary I could distribute without the surrounding architecture needing a runtime to run the application.</p><p>So that ruled out my two go to languages, PHP and NodeJs/Javascript. And lead me down the Golang or Rust path.</p><p>I will concede I actually attempted to use Rust first. There seems to be even more hype around Rust at present and watching all the conferences around Rust and WebAssembly that are popping up on YouTube I took a stab. As this is a Golang article I won’t delve too deep into Rust, lets just say after half a day I quickly realised if I wanted to get a proof of concept out quickly for this new project Rust was not the language I should be learning on the job for. This is by far not a knock at Rust. It looks really promising, it is probably just a little too far out of my comfort level right now.</p><p>So having wasted a half a day I picked up the Golang handbook and started a project.</p><p>I had run all the samples you can find in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">tour guide</a> multiple times in the past so the core concepts like operators, values, structs etc I had an understanding of already. Packages on the other hand caused me some confusion early on which I’ll delve into further down this article.</p><h2>The Proof Of Concept</h2><p>Building the POC I dumped all my code in the <code>main</code> package. At this point the code was pretty ropey. But it did confirm for me the approach was going to work. I felt pretty at home with writing at least basic code, the syntax is very similar to PHP and javascript. Well to be more specific strongly typed PHP8.0 and Typescript.</p><p>I was getting on quite well with the language and now wanted to refactor the work into something I would be happy to commit to version control.</p><h2>Folder Structure</h2><p>This still irks me a little, it’s almost hard coded into my brain. Code goes into a <code>src</code> folder and is organised by logical groupings. At least this is how I work and is the accepted structure for the languages I use day to day.</p><p>Golang on the other hand has a different recommended structure. Its not a requirement but is recommended so I went with it. Full details can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout">https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout</a></p><p>Im sure there must be a reason that’s inherent in the language or devised by some people smarter than me that makes this a better structure, but at this point I just don’t like it. It may become clearer the more I use Golang but I just feel the separation detaches the domain relationships and functionality. I don’t see why private code should be in a wholly different location when Golang has public exports inherent in the language.</p><h2>Modules</h2><p>This is where I hit my first real hurdle, maybe I didn’t read the docs well enough, or maybe it was just me. But I had a good few hours of frustration with my IDE (Intellij IDEA) shouting at me because it couldn’t find my code. At least part of the problem was my choice to just dump everything in <code>main.go</code>, then migrating to a directory type project, and finally landing on a module structure. I also think I may of been led down a few garden paths reading up on outdated articles.</p><p>I managed to figure it out eventually and it is pretty obvious with hindsight. I haven’t yet been in a position to write a module that’s meant to be consumed externally so i’m cautious of being too critical here. But from my relatively short experience I don’t understand why you can’t use relative imports in internal code?</p><p>The fact only its name is known by a package, but it needs to explicitly define the whole module path to pickup other packages feels a little off to me:</p><div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;go&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-go&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:false,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:false,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;showPanel&quot;:false,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Go&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;go&quot;}">package foobar
  
import (
	"github.com/xxx/xxx/internal/bazzer" // why not just "../bazzer"?
)</pre></div><h2>Dependency Loops</h2><p>Im not sure how common this is, but I had a real hard time when refactoring due to cyclic dependencies on structs. Again mainly my fault and bad design in my proof of concept. If I had started with modules up front I don’t think I would of had this issue. But the good thing that came of this is my understanding of Golang interfaces.</p><p>What I really like about them is their implicit rather than explicit nature (duck typing). When I found out about this it all became clear what I needed to do to resolve my problems.</p><h2>err != nil</h2><p>I don’t think a Golang article is complete without the mention of <code>err != nil</code>. Even before I started I knew about this. I have seen various articles propose how to write better code to prevent the repetition. Something I did pickup along the way was the use of <code>defer</code> which is a pretty neat feature allowing you to something similar to <code>try{}finally</code>. But I would be lying if I didn’t say I would be immensely grateful to see <code>try{}catch</code> make an appearance in Golang.</p><h2>Releasing</h2><p>Building the project was always super simple. I then needed to figure out how I could distribute this for different architecture. By the time I got here I was feeling pretty confident with what I had achieved, my confidence lead me to starting to reinventing a process already handled exceptionally by the <a href="https://goreleaser.com/">Goreleaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader">Godownloader</a> projects. These two projects make it super simple to provide access to built copies of your app.</p><p>Which made it very surprising Godownloader seems to be struggling: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161">https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161</a></p><p>To me these two packages feel like the composer and npm of the PHP and Javascript world i’m used to.</p><p>They appear to be a critical part of the ecosystem and certainly helped me get to a usable system very quickly.</p><p>In short a simple generated yml file and some CI scripts and I had automated releases available to the project without much customisation required.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are definitely some things i’m not used to or fully understand. But i’m still very interested and very happy with what i’ve able to achieve pretty quickly. It has a familiar syntax which no doubt helps and I can’t believe i’ve got to the conclusion without mentioning its SUPER fast. I’ll be talking more about the specific project this was about when its ready for launch. The source code will be open source, so please don’t judge it too harshly. It will be my first Golang project, hopefully one of many.</p><h4>Want to know when I have new content? Enter your email address to be notified when it’s available.</h4></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction
</h2>

<p>I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is changing the way you think.  The below is a collection of material I've found useful for motivating these changes.
</p>

<h2>Thought Provokers</h2>

<p>Ramblings that make you think about the way you design.  Not everything can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>In premodern India,</strong> debates were entertainment in courtly settings, a sport for profiteers and clever men who enjoyed a quick turn of phrase or put-down. Successful debaters gained followers, fame, even wealth. Those pragmatic aims intertwined with nobler ones: religious believers and nonbelievers debated over deep religious truths. Both inside and outside religious traditions, participants sparred over controversies with significant social implications. Even the efficacy of medical cures was hard-fought in the debate arena.</p>
<p>During the 9th to 10th century CE, VÄ�caspati MiÅ›ra, an Indian philosopher who was part of a Hindu tradition called â€˜NyÄ�yaâ€™ (or â€˜reasonâ€™) argued that debate benefits society when it aims for truth. He thought, too, that debate helps us humans achieve ultimate happiness in our short, fragile and often painful human lives. But if debate has such noble aims, should we care about winning or losing? And if debate leads us to the truth, should we always debate everyone, everywhere? To understand VÄ�caspatiâ€™s answer, we must first understand the NyÄ�ya philosophy of debate.</p>
<p>For NyÄ�ya philosophers, we acquire ultimate happiness by ending the selfâ€™s painful cycle of rebirth, its journey from life to life, always bound to our past actions. Before we can end this cycle, we must rid ourselves of ethical vices. And this requires knowing the truth. This is why, for NyÄ�ya thinkers, a certain kind of debate is important, as it helps us learn the truth. This truth-seeking debate is called â€˜discussionâ€™ (<em>vÄ�da</em>). This required putting forward your own thesis and criticising a contrary thesis through a specific type of inference designed to convince your opponent of the truth. Discussion was hardcore, technical stuff. Still, NyÄ�ya discussion for truth doesnâ€™t use obtuse language. Its goal isnâ€™t rhetorical trickery but making someone know something. If the components of inference are in place, and the thesis presented is true, then your conversation partner would actually come to know the truth. But to work, that inference must have certain necessary components, put together in a particular form.</p>
<p>One component part of NyÄ�ya inference is a reason that both parties agree with. Itâ€™s a fallacy to use controversial or unproven reasons â€“ a fallacy which, if youâ€™re caught out on it, would disqualify you in a debate. VÄ�caspati discusses the example of an argument about the nature of sound based on it not having certain characteristics. But the problem is when the interlocutors donâ€™t agree on whether those characteristics are decisive â€“ just as light can be a wave or a particle, thereâ€™s an open enquiry about what to conclude from the observation. Until the controversy is settled, NyÄ�ya philosophers reject any argument about sound based on these particular features. So when those engaged in a discussion have opposing views, they are to put forward their best evidence in a convincing way. Even while challenging each other, they draw each other in. Bridge-building is, in some sense, built into discussion for the truth.</p>
<p>And agreement wasnâ€™t always easy to come by for Indian thinkers. There was intense disagreement over religious texts foundational for much of societyâ€™s structure, the Vedas. For example, Buddhists rejected these texts and â€“ depending on which scholars you believe â€“ much of the societal structure that came with them. They also interpret ordinary experience differently than NyÄ�ya philosophers. Think thereâ€™s a coffee cup over there? For some Buddhists, that cup is not a cup but a construction of your mind. For others, itâ€™s merely a cluster of atomic bits you call a â€˜cupâ€™. Think you have a self? Not so fast, says the self-denying Buddhist.</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another</p>
<p>And yet, despite the chasm between them, we have evidence that Buddhists and NyÄ�ya philosophers debated, in person and through generations of written conversation. So are NyÄ�ya philosophers premodern free-speech absolutists, for whom the desire for unbridled debate is above all else? Is debate for them an almost salvific activity, to be entered into with all comers, at all times? Would they, for instance, agree with the signatories of a recent letter to <em>Harperâ€™s</em> who argue that restricting debate â€˜invariably hurts those who lack powerâ€™ and that the â€˜way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them awayâ€™?</p>
<p><strong>For VÄ�caspati and other</strong> NyÄ�ya philosophers, debate works only under certain conditions. It wonâ€™t always, everywhere, for everyone, result in a turn towards truth. In the background to NyÄ�ya thinking about debate are older texts, such as <em>Carakaâ€™s Compendium</em>, which urges medical experts to consider their own rhetorical and intellectual abilities, the hostility or friendliness of the audience, and the abilities of their interlocutor, before agreeing to a debate. VÄ�caspati adds additional dimensions to this calculus: the ethical stakes and the moral qualities of oneâ€™s conversation partner. And he draws the lines for our dialectic practices by distinguishing between three kinds of debate: discussion (<em>vÄ�da</em>), disputation (<em>jalpa</em>) and wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>). VÄ�caspati used these categories to work out how debateâ€™s practical aims (victory, material gain) are related to its epistemic ones (convincing, truth-seeking).</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another. For instance, students and teachers engage in discussion. But sometimes debate participants are focused only on winning, are prideful about their supposed â€˜knowledgeâ€™, arenâ€™t responsive to facts, and are looking for money or fame. VÄ�caspati points out that sometimes debate occurs between such less-than-honest interlocutors in front of powerful people who hold sway over large populations. In India, this was the royal court, where the winner might influence the establishment of a religion by decree. Today, this could include the court of social media, where powerful, Tweet-happy politicians influence society with a click of a mouse.</p>
<p>In his context, VÄ�caspati allows you to stoop to an apparently lower standard of rationality: faced with a powerful person spouting dangerous falsehoods and misleading people who depend on them, you might use fallacies to â€˜refuteâ€™ them. This is the second kind of debate, known as disputation (<em>jalpa</em>). In disputation, whether your argument is genuinely good matters less than its ability to convince the watching judges or crowd. Twist your opponentâ€™s words, read them literally instead of metaphorically, engage in bad reasoning â€“ itâ€™s all fair game in a disputation. Of course, returning fallacy for falsehood might not be a robust way of undermining a lie, but it could convince an easily swayed audience.</p>
<p>Should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic?</p>
<p>You could even engage in a third form of debate, wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>) â€“ putting forward no position, but leaving that aside for the sake of merely knocking down a dangerous person. Wrangling is often condemned as a performative contradiction: one canâ€™t truly lack a position when arguing against someone else. Why would you criticise someoneâ€™s view if you didnâ€™t think the opposite, or something close, were true? Imagine arguing against a flat-Earther, painstakingly showing their fallacious use of science and their cherrypicking of evidence. When they ask: â€˜And what do you think?â€™, you shrug. Youâ€™re just playing devilâ€™s advocate. NyÄ�ya thinkers find this attitude, which they identify in some Buddhists, dubious. A wrangler is a kind of sceptic lacking any intellectual core. Today we might think of trolls, the kind found in the darker corners of the internet, meme-generators who seem to lack any position of their own, having only glee in attacking others.</p>
<p>Taking up either strategy, disputation or wrangling, is risky and could backfire. If a judge identifies your fallacies, you lose the debate. Worse yet, your audience will conclude that your opponent is right. In VÄ�caspatiâ€™s view, when high-stakes debates occur over moral issues, if an audience is swayed, this could damage the correct order of things in a profound way. So when should a truth-seeker engage in debate with an opponent who holds opposing views, views they find morally reprehensible and potentially dangerous? Academics face this situation now and again: should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic? What if that debate were to be held at a local middle school, where the audience is young students without the relevant education to identify bad science? For VÄ�caspati, the answer is that our debate practices depend on our circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>In considering what</strong> to do, VÄ�caspati considers the ethical views of his opponents, worrying about the â€˜collapse of righteousnessâ€™ (<em>dharma-viplava</em>) in the situation where a malicious debater argues in front of powerful people. Yet he doesnâ€™t draw hard-and-fast lines about whom to debate based just on their views. Those people who seem to have no position of their own? Theyâ€™re welcome to join into discussion of the truth, if theyâ€™re genuinely interested in learning. And those people whose views challenge your religious perspective? NyÄ�ya philosophers famously oppose Buddhists who donâ€™t just disagree about abstract metaphysical ideas, but who challenge the religious orthodoxy of the day. And yet, over time, NyÄ�ya thinkers engage with, and even learn from, their opponents.</p>
<p>VÄ�caspati doesnâ€™t offer a flowchart about whom to debate and when. But in prioritising debate for truth, this NyÄ�ya philosopher encourages rational discussion that finds common ground even in intense disagreement. When a conversation partner ceases to participate in the joint project of truth-seeking, playing by different rules, losing any sensitivity to reality, …</p></div></div></div>

<p>In my book "How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism" I point out that the claims for Big Tech powers of behavior modification powers emanate from the companies' own self-serving boasts pitched to bring in new ad-tech customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>I point to the thinness of the external research on ad-tech's efficacy, and the replication failures of its research foundations on things like "sentiment analysis," "microexpressions" and "Big 5 Personalities" – the whole panoply of digital phrenology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are undeniable, easily measured means by which Big Tech modifies our behavior that don't require us to treat marketing puffery as ground truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to talk to your friends you have to use Facebook because Mark Zuckerberg is holding them hostage with monopoly tactics
</li>
<li>
<p>Google uses monopoly rents to buy its way to search default on every platform, so the answer to every question you ask comes from Google</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple gets to decide which apps you're allowed to use, who can fix your devices, and when you have to throw them away and buy new ones, thanks to DRM and lavish spending to kill dozens of Right to Repair initiatives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are mass-scale, persistent behavior modifications that have nothing to do with psychological manipulation and everything to do with economic chicanery.</p>
<p>This week on the Freakonomics podcast, Stephen Dubner turns an economic lens on Big Tech's ad-tech boasts.</p>
<p>He talks to Steve Tadelis, an academic economist who once headed a program at Ebay to evaluate the efficacy of ad spending. First they tried eliminating "brand" advertising (that is, advertising buys for the word "ebay") and found that there was no drop in their revenues.</p>
<p>The logic behind Ebay buying ads for "ebay" is that if they don't, their competitors will, so a search for "ebay" will bring up links to Amazon. That happened…and people scrolled right past the Amazon ads to the "organic" Ebay link below the ads.</p>
<p>But Ebay also buys a bunch of keyword ads for products, like "guitar" or "washing machine" or "picture frame." They estimated 5% of their revenue came from these ads, and that every $1 they spent on them brought in $1.50.</p>
<p>Tadelis designed another experiment and found that these ads were actually responsible for 0.5% of their revenue – an order of magnitude less than their estimate – and that every $1 they spent generated $0.60 in <em>losses</em>. They cut $100m from their ad-spending.</p>
<p>But despite publication of these findings, the world increased its ad-tech spending. Tadelis attributes this to the fact that the major players in ad-tech are all incentivized to repeat the unsubstantiated tale of ad-tech's efficacy.</p>
<p>Ad-tech companies, publishers, and ad-tech buying consultancies are all compromised and unable to objectively assess whether ads work (cue Upton Sinclair: "It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it").</p>
<p>And, of course, now Big Tech's critics have joined the ranks of those who insist that ad-tech works with spooky, devastating efficacy.</p>
<p>For evidence, all of them point to how much money the industry generates.</p>
<p>Why would people buy these products if they didn't work? Well, the obvious answer is, "That happens all the time." See:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multivitamins
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge funds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's another answer: "it's a bubble."</p>
<p>A recent, excellent book on the ad-tech bubble is Tim Hwang's SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost</a></p>
<p>Hwang tells Dubner that in a bubble, "the red lights are flashing but everybody in the industry just refuses to take a look at the real data."</p>
<p>Bubbles thrive on opacity and complexity. Think of the 2008 financial crisis, where the lack of transparency in "toxic assets" was compounded by their complexity, which led people – including "sophisticated" regulators and investors – to trust them.</p>
<p>They assumed that the manifest absurdity of the claims made by CDO salespeople must reflect their own ignorance. After all, all those OTHER people wouldn't spend trillions on derivatives if they weren't safe enough to buy yourself and exercise regulatory forbearance over.</p>
<p>But as Hwang points out, the ad-tech market is built on garbage. By Google's own reckoning, 60% of the ads that are charged for are never seen by any human being – literally the majority of the industry's product is a figment of feverish machine imaginations.</p>
<p>While Google's own research (and that of other Big Tech players) show that ad-tech works, independent researchers find the opposite: switching from "behavioral" (surveillance) ads to "contextual" ads only reduces clickthrough by 5%.</p>
<p>Behavioral ad clickthroughs are 0.01-0.03%, and much of that is bot activity.</p>
<p>The industry is opaque and incestuous. Ad agencies – nominally working for advertisers – get massive kickbacks from ad-tech platforms for bringing them business.</p>
<p>Proctor and Gamble – the company that invented the concept of brand ads – tried taking $200m out of its online ad spend and saw <em>zero</em> change in sales.</p>
<p>And yet, ad-tech spending continues to rise.</p>
<p>Hwang says we need a "punk rock" National Bureau of Economic Research, an org that will neutrally measure ad-tech performance and slowly deflate the bubble rather than bursting it, because an ad-tech collapse would kill ad-supported media.</p>
<p>All this is kind of a microcosm for the problems of economics in general. For decades, economics was dominated by the neoclassical idea of "homo economicus," a rational utility maximizer whose bad choices were good, actually.</p>
<p>(That's still the cartoon that undergrads get)</p>
<p>Advertising – especially brand ads – is grounded in the idea that irrationality is universal and exploitable, that you can trick people into paying a 50,000% markup by slapping a logo on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>But advertisers – and the industry – assume <em>they</em> are immune to irrationality, that they don't need to worry that they themselves will be suckered by slick sales-patter from ad tech, or their agencies.</p>

<p>Last week, the largest organized strike in human history shut down India. 250,000,000 people struck against Indian PM Narendra Modi's neoliberal reforms to the agricultural sector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms">https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms</a></p>
<p>These reforms don't just remove the collective bargaining and price controls that protect the ag sector (which employs more than half the Indian working population), but also stripped multinational corporations and government of liability for harms to their workers.</p>
<p>All this while unemployment is at 27%, and 76% of rural Indians lack the funds to cover their basic nutritional needs. Meanwhile Indian billionaires have increased their wealth by 35% during the pandemic. India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has made $12m per <em>hour</em> since March.</p>
<p>The strike didn't just turn out unemployed people and farmers: the turnout was driven by acts of solidarity from ever sector of society.</p>
<p>In his discussion with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now, P Sainath offers some really important political context.</p>
<p>Modi has had a comfortable Congressional majority for two years and has three years left to go in his mandate, so why did he wait for the pandemic to make this far-reaching power-grab?</p>
<p>Sainath: "The reasoning was, these blokes are on their knees now. They can’t organize. They can’t hit back. And in fact, many leading neoliberal intellectuals, economists and journalists, editors, incited the government, saying, 'Never waste a good crisis.'"</p>
<p>It's shock doctrine shit, in other words. But Modi badly misjudged the moment: rather than being beating beyond resistance, Indians have been beaten to the sticking point, and will no longer be fooled by religious bigotry and neoliberal fairy tales.</p>
<p>Right wing movements around the world are grounded in the idea that some people are born to rule and the rest of us are born to be ruled over. Antimajoritarian philosophy isn't compatible with democracy, because it requires sustained turkeys-voting-for-Christmas to survive.</p>
<p>As India shows, the traditional tools of antimajoritarianism – xenophobia, sectarianism, armed violence – are unstable in the long run. Eventually there comes a point when you can't just shout "Muslims are scary!" at starving people and expect them to take that for an answer.</p>
<p>Indians have been slaughtered by both covid and mismanagement. They are at the breaking point. They are rising up.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started to clone DEC's PDP workhorse minicomputers, especially the PDP-8, which was replicated in the USSR as the Saratov-2. Today, the Saratov-2 is a distant memory, with not even a single high-quality photo of the system online.</p>
<p>Until now. Russian urban explorer Ralph Mirebs's photos of a "Soviet Computing Cemetery" (location undisclosed) that features the rotting remains of a Saratov-2 amid the ashes and fire-suppresant residue of a long-ago data-center blaze.</p>
<p><a href="https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/">https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/</a></p>
<p>The Saratov-2 was wild: it didn't have a microprocessor; rather, it was broken down into components, each in its own drawer: a 12-bit computing unit, I/O, RAM (ferromagnetic cubes).</p>
<p>Also present in the cemetery: an Electronics 100/25 – the Soviet version of the PDP-11 – and some DVK-2Ms (early personal computers).</p>
<p>The author recalls their own computer science education in 1993, when "one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network."</p>

			<p>From the moment I started paying attention to the tech industry, Paul Graham was there.  My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore.  His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.</p>

<p>I recognized that he had a tendency towards <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">self-aggrandizement</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">awkward flattery of his readers</a>, but at worst he seemed harmless.  As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn’t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.</p>

<p>Recently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore.  He’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mod.html">written</a> about the need to defend “moderates” from bullies on the “extreme left”, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1334441961147822081">asserted</a> that “the truth is to the right of the median” because “the left is culturally dominant,” and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjGX2-bU4AAWkUX?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">justified</a> Coinbase’s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed “political” by saying that it “will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.”</p>

<p>I went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something.  It turned out that I had.  There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design.  In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In April 2001, six years after the release of the Java language, Paul Graham weighed in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html">I’ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won’t be a very successful language.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He followed up with a number of observations about Java, such as the fact that it was designed by committee, infantilizes its users, and owed its initial success to an ailing corporate sponsor.  But, he wrote, this wasn’t an analysis of Java so much as introspection on his own “hacker’s radar”.  This radar was the aesthetic response of an expert programmer, drawn from epiphenomena surrounding the language and the opinions of other experts in his social circle.</p>

<p>A month later, in an essay on why languages are popular, he doubled down on the importance of his personal intuition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Programming languages are <em>for</em> hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of a language can only be judged by experts (“a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software”), and adoption by those experts will drive adoption by everyone else.  Ultimately, “a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.”</p>

<p>The context for both essays was that Graham was creating his own language, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>.  He wanted it to be popular, and was working out how to make that happen.</p>

<p>The first intrinsic driver of popularity he named was “brevity”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he’ll have to type.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He called back to this when discussing the importance of libraries, which can reduce any program to a single invocation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that Graham was referring to Perl’s core library functions, not the much larger set of library functions that were even then available via <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, because he placed this responsibility wholly upon the shoulders of the language designer, saying language design would become increasingly focused on “how to design great libraries.”</p>

<p>Graham named other drivers of popularity in this essay, but he returned to brevity <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html">again</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">again</a> over the next year, culminating in an essay on the singular importance of brevity, now dubbed “succinctness”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough that except in pathological examples you can treat them as identical.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drawing from studies that found “programmers seemed to generate about the same amount of code per day regardless of the language”, he declared that “the only way to get software written faster was to use a more succinct language”.</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, did he mention libraries.  The next month, he explained that given a sufficiently succinct language, users could simply write their own libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">As for libraries, their importance also depends on the application. For less demanding problems, the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power of the language. Where is the breakeven point? Hard to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you’d be likely to call an application. If a company considers itself to be in the software business, and they’re writing an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several hackers and take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing libraries.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a significant departure from his earlier writings.  Only a year before, he had stated that “[i]t’s hard to design good libraries. It’s not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.”  He had emphasized that library design was a key part of language design, and even a year later he would tell us “[d]esign usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.”</p>

<p>Now he argued that the language designer only need provide a barebones language of sufficient brevity, and all else would follow.  Library design can’t be both critically important and an incidental part of someone else’s six-month software project.  Despite this, Graham never mentioned libraries ever again.</p>

<p>A year later, he explained that Arc was trying to be a “hundred-year language”.  “It may seem presumptuous,” he wrote, but “[l]anguages evolve slowly because they’re not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.”  He asserted the most important part of the language were the “fundamental operators”, because the rest of the language “could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators”.</p>

<p>What, then, makes a language ready for the 22nd century?  Certainly not any concerns about performance, since “[e]ven if [computers] only end up being a paltry million times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming languages substantially.”  Not data structures, since they’re just a premature optimization of the humble list.  Not a mechanism (or even notation) for parallel computation, since a simple description of the problem will “ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations of data.”</p>

<p>A hundred-year language <em>should</em>, however, be succinct.  First “write down the program you’d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.”  And of course the program you’d really like to write is the shortest one possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">[T]he algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that’s shorter?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“If we had the hundred-year language now,” Graham wrote, “it would at least make a great pseudocode.”  Confusingly, he asserted that since it will need to perform well on its million-times-faster future processor, “presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware.”</p>

<p>“When you see these ideas laid out like that,” he wrote, “it’s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?”</p>

<hr>

<p>Four years later, in 2008, Arc was released.  It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace">Lisp-1</a> with shorter names and fewer parentheses than most other Lisps, and some reader macros to make anonymous functions easier to define.  All primitives were defined in terms of MzScheme, a different Lisp, which provided the compiler and other tooling.  It also came with a barebones web framework which used continuations, reminiscent of the Smalltalk-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)">Seaside framework</a> which had been around since 2002.</p>

<p>It was, in all, underwhelming.  There were many paths that could have led Graham to his professed goals, and he took none of them.</p>

<p>He had written that strings were premature optimization, and should be replaced by lists of characters.  If he had done so, and made the characters full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point">Unicode code points</a>, Arc could have been one of the few languages not suffering from a half-century hangover stretching all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.  Instead, the initial release used byte strings which only supported the ASCII character set.</p>

<p>Graham had asked “[h]ow many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code? I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.”  But the undeniably succinct primitives and composition rules of array programming languages were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Server-based deployment of software was a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">central theme</a> in Graham’s essays, and his continuation-based web framework was an interesting and fairly novel way to create continuity across multiple requests in a single session.  But since each link on the page was a continuation, and each continuation was stored in-memory in a single process, this created a single, memory-hungry point of failure.  For years, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> would simply display “unknown or expired link” if you waited too long to click a link.  If Arc had its own runtime, it could have supported …</p></article></div></div></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The harmful effects of the algorithms employed by social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been well documented: polarisation, privacy issues, you name it. Even though I share a lot of these concerns between all the petty tribalism there is potential for having deep and meaningful conversations too. But I do not think it is possible to improve existing social networks, as even though these networks are not inherently evil they are a result of a bad business model. Their main objective is maximising user engagement the more time you spend glued to your screen the better. With this model at the core it is hard for these companies to implement change. In certain cases taking initiatives for improving the mental well being of users or for promoting productive discourse might be impractical too. The quality of the experience is secondary to the screen time.</p>
<p>The solution in my opinion is to build networks with strong core values that promote productive conversations. Start with a small community with a solid foundation then gradually expand keeping the values intact. What would such a network look like? Well like anything great it will have to take what is good about its predecessors and improve on their shortcomings. The improvements should be significant so as to provide a reason for people to actually switch. But improvements is a vague term to see how social networks can be improved I think it is better to analyse and think about the components that make up these networks from first principles.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
<p>If we have learned anything from <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation">Parler</a> it is that sometimes it becomes necessary to infringe upon people’s free speech rights especially when these privileges come at the cost of civilised discourse. Still banning people is a slippery slope for example if you ban a terrorist account then what do you do when China asks you to ban accounts of Hong Kong protesters? You have given them the precedent. I think the solution is to have strict moderation but with strong foundational principles and make them clear early on. A good strategy is to only censor people if they are disrespecting other people not when they are expressing their opinions or ideas. Even if you think that the earth is not flat you should let other people talk it out if they are being civil about it.</p>
<p>If you look at communities like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/">Ask Historians subreddit</a> where the moderators rule with an iron hand you can notice that the posts and comments in these forums are of much higher quality. But still it is anecdotal evidence and these communities are small when you compare them to giants like Facebook and Twitter. Also how would you moderate millions of post? Even if it was possible for human to do it can you rely on them to look at these posts objectively and report them only if they violate the guidelines? I believe if you start a community with strong core values it is possible to motivate people with a little bit of algorithm ingenuity to act in good faith.</p>
<h2>Feed</h2>
<p>Feeds and Algorithms are inextricably linked, feeds serve content curated by algorithms. Feeds can be finite or infinite providing an endless stream of posts and the algorithms used by these can range from simple algorithms that serve posts in chronological order to relatively complex machine learning based recommender systems. Most of the big platforms nowadays use recommender systems coupled with infinite feeds. It can get really messy if a single feed is used to serve both recommended content and the content that the user is subscribed to. YouTube is a good example of this even though they have great recommendations the content that the user has actually subscribed to gets lost in the feed of recommended videos. You might argue that they have a different feed for subscriptions but its not the one they show first when the user enters their app/website and that is the one that actually counts.</p>
<p>For our ideal social network I think it will be better to use two different feed one main finite feed solely for the subscribed/followed content and one infinite feed that recommends content based on the the interests of the user. For the subscription feed I do not think a purely chronological algorithm will work as a post about an important event like a friend’s birthday might get trapped between relatively trivial posts but between the posts of similar importance chronological information can be taken into account. A more complex algorithm will be required for the recommendation feed I will talk about it more in the monetisation section. The goal of the feeds should be to maximise signal from noise and not waste the time of its users.</p>
<h2>Monetisation</h2>
<p>Advertising is a bad and unsustainable business model for social networks, if your main source of revenue are advertisements you will be incentivised to increase user engagement and sometimes even at the cost of the actual experience. The best business model for social networks I think is the Wikipedia model. Ask people who can afford to to pay a nominal subscription to keep the servers running. The success of the company will actually depend how happy its users are with the platform.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I have used vague terms like ‘algorithmic ingenuity’ and statements like ‘build a system that recommends people posts based on their interests’ without mentioning the specifics of the algorithm that is because I do not know and when it comes to moderation algorithms neither does Twitter. Learning based algorithms are not completely transparent and it is difficult to predict what they are going to do and it becomes even more difficult to come up with good algorithms when the goals of the networks are misaligned with the public good. What my argument is that in social networks that do not depend on advertising money engineers will be actually motivated to come up with better algorithms for moderation and recommendation.</p>
<h2>Interface and Posts</h2>
<p>The whole social network revolves around posts these are the primary content that people use to interact with their subscribers/followers. For Twitter these are limited length messages, for Quora these are questions, for Instagram images, for YouTube videos, etc. The format of these posts is important. They can be designed such that people come up with clever ways to use them (example tweets) and they can also be designed in a more restrictive way such that people struggle to get across what they mean (example tweets).</p>
<p>The ideal post in my opinion is a mixture of these two we could allow people to post both a restricted length post and a full fledged article but nothing in between this leaves space for creativity and does not hamper conversation. An option could be given to the users to sort their feed by articles, shorter posts or both. And instead of like and dislike buttons we can use recommend and not recommend buttons the functions might be same but change in name might help people make conscious decision about whether they want similar content recommended to them or not.</p>
<p>Another way we can improve conversations I think is by giving people a small break between writing a post and actually posting it. This might seem counter-intuitive but I think if given a chance to reflect on things people generally take right decisions and it can also give them time to calm down so that they do not engage in pointless name calling. We can implement it by an optional 15 seconds timer which is enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of the post is to start a conversation about what an ideal social network might look like. But these are just abstract ideas and musings there is no evidence a social networks like this will be successful but instead of conjecturing about whether things will work or not it is better to try to implement it and see for yourself. In that spirit I am going to try to implement a social network based on these principles. But I am a lone programmer and I need help if some part of my post resonated with you and you think that implementing such a network is worth a try contact me at <a href="mailto:dubeyaayush08@gmail.com">dubeyaayush08@gmail.com</a> and maybe we could team up.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

			<h3>Balenciaga created a video game for their Fall/Winter 2021 presentation</h3> 
			<h4>Well, it's not a real video game more like a simulation... But anyway, it's cool!</h4>
			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-videogame.gif" alt="balenciaga video game"></p><p>Due to covid-19 being in full swing the big brands had to think long and hard about what exactly they should do for their collection presentations. Here are the highlights: </p>
			<p>• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCQxPSNzU2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prada did a “livestream”</a> of their fashion show which ended with a Q&amp;A with Rick Owens and Miuccia Prada. Prada’s show didn’t look like a real livestream at all, more like a high production recording that took a whole day to film. We don’t mind though, no point having a “live” livestream really. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/747647002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burberry cleverly partnered with Twitch</a> for their livestream.<br>
			• Jacquemus had a socially distanced show in a wheat field and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vTYQWNFgTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestreamed</a> it.<br>
			• Gucci hosted their own fashion week called “<a href="https://www.guccifest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GucciFest</a>” collaborating with Gus Van Sant on their 7 part video series. Our attention span didn’t make it past the first episode unfortunately. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.chanel.com/fr/mode/collection/metiers-art-2020-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chanel had their show in a castle</a> and they only had one guest watching the show: Kristen Stewart. Weeeeeeiiiird. We hope she tested negative...<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh7ab7-Gf_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celine</a> hired out an empty football stadium in Monaco where Hedi Slimane showed his Gen-Z-friendly collection.<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cmolbk0EWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acne Studios</a> did a neat livestream at the empty Grand Palais.<br>
			• Balenciaga on the other hand went all in and created an <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online videogame</a> dedicated to their new collection - it’s something we would only expect from Demna Gvasalia. <br></p>

			<p>The game is called <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow</i></a> and it’s a simulation taking you through a digital world that Balenciaga created where the characters are wearing the brand’s Fall/Winter 2021 collection. The entire simulation [we call it a simulation and not a game since you are just walking a pathway instead of playing] takes place for around 15 minutes. It starts with an intro where you roll through the “characters” like in a 90s fighting game detailing the garments in each look [check out the animated GIF above].</p>

			<p>You then transition into a Blade Runner-esque world based in a concrete building perhaps in a big metropolitan city, where the models are showcasing the new collection while standing around, browsing on their phones or taking selfies. </p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-01.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-02.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-03.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>You then walk through 5 zones, all zones looking apocalyptic. See this “Bringing life back to earth” ad in their game below, indicating a scary future.</p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-04.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-05.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-06.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>There is a small story in the game and it’s very very much fitting for Balenciaga’s brand and current creative direction. <span>*SPOILER ALERT, highlight to read*</span> <span>We thought the story would end when we arrive to a rave in the forest, but we continued from there, bypassing models dancing high on life </span><span>*SPOILER ALERT OVER*</span></p>
			

			<p>If this was a contest, hands down we would give Balenciaga the golden medal 🥇 for their spring/summer 2021 presentation.</p>

			


			<div>
				<h4><span>FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h4>
				<p>Phew, all these brands’ Marketing and Digital departments must have been sweating hard from all that digital thinking this year. A for effort guys! We will be watching you again in 6 months.</p>

<p>Your day-to-day interaction with this would be only the last line.</p>

<p><code>gpg --import</code> has to be executed only once, after which the key will be part of the local keychain
(persists reboots as well).
That’s literally all there is to it, after following the below steps.</p>

<h2 id="do-it-yourself">Do it yourself</h2>

<p>Start the stopwatch - we have 2 minutes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate a PGP key
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> gpg <span>--batch</span> <span>--generate-key</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>EOF</span><span>
  %no-protection
  Key-Type: default
  Subkey-Type: default
  Name-Real: Foo Bar
  Expire-Date: 0
</span><span>EOF
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>The key is created without a passphrase because of the <code>%no-protection</code> option. Otherwise a <code>Passphrase: &lt;pass&gt;</code> would be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Create a sops configuration file with the key’s fingeprint. This is the ✨ magic ✨ ingredient,
which makes the onboarding so frictionless.
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gpg <span>--list-keys</span>
pub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>SC]
      7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6
uid           <span>[</span>ultimate] Foo Bar
sub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>E]
   
<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> .sops.yaml
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: secrets/.<span>*</span><span>\.</span>dev<span>\.</span>enc<span>\.</span>yaml<span>$</span>
    pgp: 7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>This is also perfect if you want more control over the secrets, like using different keys for different environments.
For example <code>secrets/*.dev.enc.yaml</code> could use one key, and <code>secrets/*.prod.enc.yaml</code> another one.
More details on this <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops#using-sops-yaml-conf-to-select-kms-pgp-for-new-files">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use <code>sops</code> to edit and create new secrets
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sops secrets/mysecrets.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Then it just a question of distributing the keys to the right people and/or environment.
Which brings us to Keybase.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="note-for-linux-users">Note for Linux users</h4>

<p>I’ve found that both on Fedora and Ubuntu, for whatever reason, creating a new file with <code>sops</code> throws the following cryptic error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sops secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
&lt;save the file <span>in </span>the editor&gt;
File has not changed, exiting.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The solution is to create the file first and encrypt it in-place afterwards:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>vi secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
<span>$ </span>sops <span>-i</span> <span>-e</span> secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="distributing-the-key-to-firends-and-family">Distributing the key to firends and family</h2>

<p>To extract the PGP key from your local keychain, use:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gpg <span>--list-keys</span>
<span>-------------------------------</span>
pub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>SC]
      7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6
uid           <span>[</span>ultimate] Foo Bar
sub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>E]

<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--armor</span> <span>--export-secret-keys</span> 7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6 <span>&gt;</span> key.asc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>--armor</code> makes it so that the output is ASCII (<code>.asc</code>) formatted, and not in binary (default).</p>

<p>One of the most seamless ways to distribute keys and other sensitive files is Keybase.
It has a low barrier of entry, and you can control the granularity of access with “teams”.
It also integrates nicely with the filesystem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install Keybase
    
  </li>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Store the secret key under a team’s folder</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, you grab the universal path and import the key to anywhere with <code>gpg</code> installed.</p>

<h2 id="use-it-in-your-applications">Use it in your applications</h2>

<p>To use the decrypted values in your application, you can just add a line to your setup scripts
to run</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sops <span>-d</span> secrets/mysecret.dev.enc.yaml <span>&gt;</span> configuration.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(make sure to add the decrypted files to <code>.gitignore</code>)</p>

<p>For Terraform projects use <a href="https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops">terraform-sops</a>, and if you’re into Terragrunt,
it has a built-in <a href="https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#sops_decrypt_file">sops_decrypt_file</a> function.</p>

<p>You will be running <code>sops</code> only to create or edit secrets, otherwise, it will be invisible (and incredible).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>Docker's Second Death</h3></p><h3 id="feels-like-forever">Feels Like Forever</h3><p>Perhaps not quite forever, but the history with Docker <em>feels</em> really long in good and bad ways. I had joined Red Hat in the summer of 2015, the same summer that OpenShift 3.0 went GA. This was a remarkable event because it marked a redesign of the platform onto Kubernetes which itself had just gone to v1.0 (this is the same timeframe that GKE went GA, if you can believe it’s that old). Like many, I had no clue what Kubernetes or OpenShift were, and I definitely didn’t know much about Docker. I knew <em>of</em> containers. By fall I was neck deep in all three, and in love with the ecosystem a few months after.</p><p>The next spring was my first “real” encounter with Docker Inc. I didn’t attend Red Hat Summit 2016, but I distinctly remember that being the year that Docker really made its first outward antagonistic move against Red Hat OpenShift, at Red Hat’s own event. They were giving out the following shirt:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockerpatch.jpg" alt="docker-shirt"></p><p>To briefly summarize, this was an attack on Red Hat’s model of backporting patches to older versions of software (also known as “enterprise support”). Red Hat at that time shipped a version of Docker that was just slightly behind the latest cut, whereas Docker shipped their latest. I won’t go into the details of why that matters because there is still a debate today about whether backporting patches is better for an organization versus staying on the latest version of a thing (the latter has gotten considerably better in recent times). This was significant because up until that time, Docker was an integral part of the OpenShift narrative. We sold one with the other and the underlying assumption by most if not all of us was that Docker was just a great tech. In retrospect, this should have been expected as Docker Inc. started making its moves into the enterprise space and suddenly stopped being just great tech.</p><h3 id="it-was-inevitable">It Was Inevitable</h3><p>The early platform wars, as I call them, were primarily focused around OpenShift, Docker, and Pivotal. Pivotal had made significant inroads into enterprise organizations early on, and for good reason: the platform experience was pretty great. Couple that with Pivotal Labs and you had some pretty good mojo. Docker was the up and comer. It was the industry darling making a splash and it had the tech that everyone wanted or that everyone was already using. Kubernetes was still a bit of a question mark. I spent a lot of my time talking to organizations about the nuts and bolts of Kubernetes and why it mattered, or more accurately: why it should matter to them. The move by Docker to knock on OpenShift forced Red Hat messaging to over-index on Kubernetes and Linux over and above anything else. It worked and the industry caught up.</p><p>Docker, still in its industry darling state, responded quickly with Docker Swarm but never really caught on. Swarm was eventually overwhelmed (pun intended) by the uptake of Kubernetes across the industry, and this was when it died the first time: it lost the platform wars and became the very first commodity in the cloud native ecosystem. The second half of 2016 is really when Kubernetes edged out Swarm. This was made evident by the keynote demo at DockerCon 2017 in the following Spring when the presenters showcased Docker’s integration with Kubernetes on the big stage. Notably, that was the last “big” DockerCon that made a splash. From there on out, it was the Kubernetes/CNCF show.</p><h3 id="docker-debt">Docker Debt</h3><p>In all this time, Docker was always an integral part of Kubernetes. This was the relationship:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockershim.png" alt="dockershim"></p><p>And for the last 19 releases, that chain is what has been supported in Kubernetes. All that just to spin up a pod with a container in it. Docker went from necessity to technical debt. And out of all that, the community laboured until now where Docker will be deprecated in the next release of 1.20. The community has (rightfully) carried the technical debt of Docker for years to ensure the industry had what it needed for the most seamless experience given the ubiquity of the docker daemon. Here is what’s been around for a little while, but will be officially prime time in 1.20 and beyond:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/withoutdocker.png" alt="withoutdocker"></p><p>It’s a great simplification, and a return to consistency. To help visualize why this was necessary, I encourage you to view Docker as a platform abstraction on top of containers which are just an aggregate of some Linux constructs. Part of this abstraction involved an integration between the docker platform and containerd, the latter of which lives on today as arguably the most popular container runtime. Docker was never the runtime. Docker simply made containerd and other Linux constructs easy to work with so that container management would be a breeze. Instead of a dozen lines of code to create and deploy a running container, all you needed was:</p><pre><code>docker run
</code></pre><p>But like any platform, that convenience comes with a lot of bloat and technical debt. Especially over time. The removal of docker and the optimization of containerd marks a cultural shift of sorts for the cloud native landscape. None of this is meant to dismiss Docker Inc. Kubernetes today would not be where it is without Docker Inc. That’s a fact. The technologies and the competition that Docker Inc drove were some of the best things to ever happen to the industry. Now as far as turning a profitable business model out of open source technology goes, Docker Inc will likely be studied as a cautionary flash in the pan. Still, it’s important that we separate out the company’s contributions versus its business model. What’s left of the Docker platform, at this point, are its shadows within Kubernetes platforms. Though it does live on strongly within CI/CD ecosystems and, ostensibly, the inner loop of development thanks to the de facto standard Dockerfile. It is a testament to the power that Docker Inc once had, that its technology lived on far beyond the obsolescence of the company until community innovation caught up to it. With all the years of bloat baked into the platform, it’s really just a matter of time before other areas to the left of the platform shed the debt of the Docker daemon.</p><p>While it had an amazing journey and an indelible impact to the industry, practically speaking Docker is dead and dying.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
Before jumping to any Kubernetes specifics, let's talk about the service discovery problem in general.</p>
<h2 id="service-discovery-problem">Service discovery problem</h2>
<p>In the world of web service development, it's a common practice to run multiple copies of a service at the same time. Every such copy is a separate instance of the service represented by a network endpoint (i.e. some <em>IP</em> and <em>port</em>) exposing the service API. Traditionally, virtual or physical machines have been used to host such endpoints, with the shift towards containers in more recent times. Having multiple instances of the service running simultaneously increases its availability and helps to adjust the service capacity to meet the traffic demand. On the other hand, it also complicates the overall setup - before accessing the service, a client (the term <em>client</em> is intentionally used loosely here; oftentimes a client of some service is another service) needs to figure out the actual IP address and the port it should use. The situation becomes even more tricky if we add the ephemeral nature of instances to the equation. New instances come and existing instances go because of the non-zero failure rate, up- and downscaling, or maintenance. That's how a so-called <strong><em>service discovery</em></strong> problem arises.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/service-discovery-problem.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Service discovery problem.</i></p>
</div>


<h2 id="server-side-service-discovery">Server-side service discovery</h2>
<p>A pretty common way of solving the service discovery problem is putting a load balancer <em>aka</em> reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx or HAProxy) in front of the group of instances constituting a single service. An address (i.e. DNS name or less frequently IP) of such a load balancer is a much more stable piece of information. It can be communicated to the clients on development or configuration stages and assumed invariable during a single client lifespan. Then, from the client standpoint, accessing the multi-instance service is no different from accessing a single network endpoint. In other words, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html">the service discovery happens completely on the server-side</a>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/server-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Server-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The load balancer abstracts the volatile set of service instances away from the clients. However, the load balancer itself needs to be aware of the up to date state of the service fleet. This can be achieved by adding a <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html"><em>service registry</em></a> component. On the startup, an instance needs to be added to the registry database. Upon the termination, the instance needs to be removed from it. One of the main tasks of the load balancer is to dynamically update its routing rules based on the service registry information.</p>
<p>While it looks very appealing from the client standpoint, the server-side service discovery may quickly reveal its downsides, especially in highly-loaded environments. The load balancer component is a <strong>single point of failure and a potential throughput bottleneck</strong>. To overcome this, the load balancing layer needs to be designed with a reasonable level of redundancy. Additionally, the load balancer may <strong>need to be aware of all the communication protocols</strong> used between services and clients and there will be always an <strong>extra network hop</strong> on the request path.</p>
<h2 id="client-side-service-discovery">Client-side service discovery</h2>
<p>Can we solve the service discovery problem without introducing the centralized load balancing component? Sure! If we keep the <em>service registry</em> component around, we can teach the clients to look up the service instance addresses in the <em>service registry</em> directly. After fetching the full list of IP addresses constituting the service fleet, a client could pick up an instance based on the load balancing strategy at its disposal. In such a case, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/client-side-discovery.html">the service discovery would be happening solely on the client-side</a>. Probably the most prominent real-world implementation of the client-side service discovery is Netflix <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a> projects.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/client-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The benefits of the client-side approach mostly come from the absence of the load balancer. There is neither a <strong>single point of failure</strong> nor a potential <strong>throughput bottleneck</strong> in the system design. There is also one less moving part which is usually a good thing and <strong>no extra network hops on the packet path</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as with the server-side service discovery, there are some significant drawbacks as well. Client-side service discovery <strong>couples clients with the <em>service registry</em></strong>. It <strong>requires some integration code</strong> to be written for every programming language or framework in your ecosystem. And obviously, this <strong>extra logic complicates the clients</strong>. There seem to be an effort to <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/">offload the client-side service discovery logic to the service proxy sidecars</a> but that's already a different story...</p>
<h2 id="dns-and-service-discovery">DNS and service discovery</h2>
<p>Service discovery can be implemented in more than just two ways. There is a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking#DNS-based_service_discovery">DNS-based service discovery (DNS-SD)</a> approach that actually even predates the massive spread of microservices. Quoting the Wikipedia, <i>"a client discovers the list of available instances for a given service type by querying the DNS PTR record of that service type's name; the server returns zero or more names of the form <code>&lt;Service&gt;.&lt;Domain&gt;</code>, each corresponding to a SRV/TXT record pair. The SRV record resolves to the domain name providing the instance..."</i> and then another DNS query can be used to resolve a chosen instance's domain name to the actual IP address. Wow, so many layers of indirection, sounds fun 🙈</p>
<p>I never worked with DNS-SD, but to me, it doesn't sound like full-fledged service discovery. Rather, DNS is used as a <em>service registry</em>, and then depending on the dislocation of the code that knows how to query and interpret DNS-SD records, we can get either a <a href="https://github.com/benschw/srv-lb">canonical client-side</a> or a <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/dns-service-discovery-haproxy/">canonical server-side</a> implementation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS">Round-robin DNS</a> can be (ab)used for service discovery. Even though it was originally designed for load balancing, or rather load distribution, having multiple A records for the same hostname (i.e. service name) returned in a rotating manner implicitly abstracts multiple replicas behind a single service name.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>DNS has a significant drawback when used for service discovery</strong>. Updating DNS records is a slow procedure. There are <strong>multiple layers of caches</strong>, including the client-side libraries, and historically record's TTL isn't strictly respected. As a result, propagating the change in the set of service instances to all the clients can take a while.</p>
<h2 id="entering-kubernetes-realm">Entering Kubernetes realm</h2>
<p>First, let's play an analogy game!</p>
<p>If I were to draw some analogies between Kubernetes and more traditional architectures, I'd compare Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/"><em>Pods</em></a> with service instances. <em>Pods</em> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/k0zc0m/kubernetes_pods_are_logical_hosts_or_simply/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">many things</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1331630336707596288?s=20">many people</a>, however, when it comes to networking <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model">the documentation clearly states that</a> <i>"...Pods can be treated much like VMs or physical hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration."</i></p>
<p>If <em>Pods</em> correspond to individual instances of a service, I'd expect a similar analogy for the <em>service</em>, as a logical grouping of instances, itself. And indeed there is a suitable concept in Kubernetes called... surprise, surprise, a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/"><em>Service</em></a>. <i>"In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service)."</i></p>
<p>Strengthening the analogy, the set of Pods making up a Service should be also considered ephemeral because neither the Pods' headcount nor the final set of IP addresses is stable. Thus, in Kubernetes, the problem of providing a reliable <strong>service discovery</strong> remains actual.</p>
<p>While creating a new Service, one should choose a name that will be used to refer to the set of Pods constituting the service. Among other things, the Service maintains an up to date list of IP addresses of its Pods organized as an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-endpoints"><em>Endpoints</em></a> (or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/"><em>EndpontSlice</em></a> since Kubernetes 1.17) object. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#cloud-native-service-discovery">Citing the documentation</a> one more time, <i>"...if you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints,</i> [I guess using the Service name] <i>that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes."</i> Well, sounds like an invitation to implement a <del>cloud-native</del> Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery with the Kubernetes control plane playing (in particular) the role of the <em>service registry</em>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/kube-native-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>However, the only real-world usage of this mechanism I've stumbled upon so far was in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2020/07/23/under-the-hood-of-linkerds-state-of-the-art-rust-proxy-linkerd2-proxy/#the-life-of-a-request"><em>service mesh</em></a> kind of software. It's a bit unfair to mention it here though because <em>service mesh</em> itself is needed to provide, in particular, the service discovery mechanism for its users. So, if you're aware of the client-side service discovery implementations leveraging Kubernetes Endpoints API please drop a comment below.</p>
<p>Luckily, as with many other things in Kubernetes, there's more than one way <del>to skin a cat</del> to get the service discovery done. And the applications that weren't born cloud-native (i.e. 99% of them) will likely find the next service-discovery mechanism much more appealing.</p>
<h2 id="network-side-service-discovery">Network-side service discovery</h2>
<p><i>Disclaimer: I've no idea if there is such thing as <em>network-side</em> service discovery in other domains and I've never seen the usage of this term in the microservices world. But I find it funny and suitable for the purpose of this paragraph.</i></p>
<p>In Kubernetes, the name of a Service object must be a valid <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names">DNS label name</a>. It's not a coincidence. When the DNS add-on is enabled (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#dns">and I guess it's almost always the case</a>), every Service gets a DNS record like <code>&lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;namespace-name&gt;</code>. Obviously, this name can be used by applications to access the service and it simplifies the life of the clients to the highest possible extent. A single well-known address behind every Service <strong>eradicates the need for any service discovery logic on the client-side</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as we already know, DNS is often ill-suited for service discovery and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#why-not-use-round-robin-dns">the Kubernetes ecosystem is not an exception</a>. Therefore, instead of using round-robin DNS to list Pods' IP addresses, Kubernetes introduces one more IP …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="toc-how-it-works-1"><span>How It Works</span></h3><p>A Raspberry Pi computer promiscuously sniffs packets on the local network. A Python script parses these packets, looking for any communication between the smart speaker and the vendor's cloud service. When detected, an API endpoint on an Arduino Nano 33 IoT microcontroller development board is accessed. This causes an LED attached to the Arduino to flash, thus alerting you to a speaker sending data to the vendor.</p><p>A single Raspberry Pi can trigger alerts on a number of Speaker Snitch devices all throughout your home.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the modern workplace, data integration skills can help you supercharge your career. Regardless of what kind of job you have, it’s likely you will be working with some kind of software. It might be a cloud billing system, an appointment scheduling system, warehouse software, or even just email. Most software applications are driven by data inputs and outputs. If you have even basic competency with data integration, it can open up many opportunities for you to automate tasks and leverage data to solve business problems.</p><p><strong>By using data, you can increase your impact at work. More impact means more opportunities, career progression, and often bigger compensation.</strong></p><p>Let’s look at how data integration skills can improve your career.</p><p>Whether your job is in accounting, business development, customer service, human resources, logistics, or manufacturing, there’s a pretty good chance data integration techniques could save you time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p>With all the talk about robots and AI eliminating jobs, you may question whether automation is a good thing. If you can use data integration to automate portions of your job, won’t that signal to management that your job may be expendable? In my experience, employees that embrace technology and use it to be more effective tend to outperform those that resist technology.</p><p>If there are significant parts of your job that cab be automated and you don’t do something about it, eventually your employer will. In some cases, this could involve offshoring your job to a country where labor is less expensive. Or it could be addressed by larger software or automation initiatives which could result in significant changes to your role. Due to the competitive nature of business, there is a continual need to reduce any forms of waste. Companies that don’t continuously improve efficiency lose their competitiveness and eventually die out.</p><p>So, given this “survival of the fittest” business environment what can you do?</p><p>Take charge of automating your own work. Be proactive about eliminating waste in your individual tasks and processes you work with. This will make you a more effective employee. You will deliver better and faster results which increases your value to your organization. It also demonstrates to management that you are a proactive innovator. It could provide job security, win you a higher rating on your next performance evaluation, and ultimately improve your compensation.</p><p>But more importantly you will be demonstrating to you manager and your coworkers how to improve business processes through automation. The improvements you make can be shared with other team members or even with other departments. In some cases, your small but creative automations could lead to a large scale rethink of how your company operates or perhaps even lead to a new product or service.</p><p>Hard to imagine doing this in your current job? Let’s talk through an example.</p><h2 id="how-to-automate-lead-acquisition">How to Automate Lead Acquisition</h2><p>Let’s say you have a general sales inquiry email address posted on your company’s web site. You are working on the marketing team and one of your responsibilities is to monitor incoming emails and look for potential customers that are interested in using your company’s service. When you identify a lead based on an incoming email, you log into <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> and type up a new Lead entry. This then triggers the sales team to reach out to the potential customer to initiate a conversation. This process has to happen pretty quickly. If you wait too long after the potential customer sends the email, they may lose interest and move onto a competitor.</p><p>This process is a perfect candidate for automation using data integration between the email message content and the Salesforce lead API.</p><p>It’s highly likely you could implement this integration with absolutely zero programming using a workflow automation tool like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zappier</a> or <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Power Automate</a>. In fact, a quick search of the Microsoft Power Automate site will uncover a pre-existing workflow that does exactly what we’re looking for:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnberry/image/upload/v1607224978/PowerAutomateSalesforce_smx5vk.png" alt="PowerAutomateParserr"></p><p>It uses a SaaS product called <a href="https://parserr.com/">Parserr</a> which specializes in parsing the unstructured text in email messages and attachments and converting it to structured data which can be more easily imported into databases or other SaaS products.</p><p>Salesforce offers many integration options that allow you to load CRM record types like leads, accounts, contacts and opportunities. In fact, here is publicly available documentation about their <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_Lead.htm">Leads API</a>:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnberry/image/upload/v1607224981/SalesforceLead_fdjuno.png" alt="SalesforceLead"></p><p>This is a great example where a simple data integration between two SaaS products reduces your labor and adds additional business benefits. The fully automated process will be faster, which will speed the sales team’s response to the customer and increase the percentage of sales wins.</p><p>This makes you more effective as an individual contributor and gets you noticed by your manager. The same integration approach you have taken on this project could be applied to many similar situations in your department or across your company. It’s possible this small success could lead to more growth opportunities at your company. Or possibly it could even be the start of a transition to a technology job, which I’ll explain next.</p><p>There are a variety of roles in the typical IT Department that require data integration expertise. Some IT organizations have a team that focuses on B2B integrations or EDI. Legacy EDI messaging is specialized skill and usually requires expertise with specific B2B platforms like <a href="https://www.softwareag.com/en_corporate/platform/integration-apis.html">WebMethods</a>, <a href="https://www.opentext.com/">OpenText</a>, or cloud-based iPaaS tools (integration platform-as-a-service). Working in a B2B integration team requires cross-functional skills. Besides expertise with EDI specifications and translation software, B2B workers usually need a deep understanding of the back-end systems like the ERP or CRM which are involved with the B2B signals. Soft skills like project management and people skills are critical as well.</p><p>Application-to-Application integration is sometimes managed by a specialized B2B integration team, but often it is handled by a general software engineering team. Since application integration usually leverages technologies like REST APIs, webhooks, GraphQL, or SOAP, IT workers with programming skills are often best suited for building these solutions. In these scenarios, engineers use their programming language of choice (like Python, Java, or C#) to connect various application API’s into an automated workflow.</p><p>Finally database integration projects involving data warehousing, data analytics, and extract-transform-load (ETL) are usually handled by a database or data engineering team. Database integration techniques are quite different from B2B integration and software engineering tasks. Database integration teams will be handling data in bulk (often big data) which requires technical knowledge of the database system’s native features. Data engineering work usually involves data platforms like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, or cloud-based ETL tools. With rapidly growing interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, data engineering is becoming a much more common job title in many IT Departments.</p><p>Any of these data integration disciplines can lead to a rewarding career path. If you are interested in coding, learning to interact with APIs and write the “glue code” that ties APIs into an integrated workflow will make you extremely valuable to potential employers. Data engineering requires expertise with a particular data platform, but tends to requires less traditional programming skills. Finally, B2B integration work requires the least amount of programming skills, but often requires deeper understanding of business processes and strong soft-skills. All of these roles can put you in a position to solve business problems and create value for your employer.</p><p>Are you interested in changing to a technology career but perhaps haven’t had time to learn to code yet? Data integration is a route for a non-technical person to transition into a technology career. In my experience it’s far easier for non-technical people to become effective at integration rather than trying to learn programming from scratch.
This may sound strange. After all, conventional wisdom is that the path to a tech career is learning to code. There is an entire educational industry that has developed around teaching JavaScript or Python to aspiring software engineers. You can go to boot camps or use online resources and after a few months of intensive work, supposedly you will be able to get a lucrative job as a software engineer. Unfortunately, from what I’ve observed many of these programs are glorified get-rich-quick schemes.</p><p>Programming isn’t for everyone. Software engineering requires a certain way of thinking that simply doesn’t come naturally to some people. Any many simply find programming unpleasant or boring. Even if you do manage to learn JavaScript, it’s not necessarily a guaranteed path to a six-figure income.</p><p>Instead of learning a programming language, perhaps a better strategy is to learn some kind of data integration tool or technique. For example, quite possible for most individuals to develop functional expertise with cloud integration platforms like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/">Azure Logic Apps</a> or <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a> within a few months. You can use the tool for a few side projects or even to solve problems in your day job. This provides you some compelling achievements to add to your resume and attract the interest of technology hiring managers.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> is another great skill to learn. The ability to query relational databases with SQL can make you more effective in many non-technical jobs, but it’s also a great way to land an entry level tech job on a data analysis or engineering team. SQL is a query language and it tends to be far easier to learn that an a full programming language. Combine basic SQL knowledge with self-serve business intelligence tools like <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft PowerBI</a> or <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and you have most of the skills necessary to move into an …</p></div></div>

I'm exploring tapping into this latent resource pool to make automated testing affordable &amp; unlock a more comprehensive configuration coverage.</p><p>The goal of DART (Distributed Android Remote Testing) is to enable any Android device to run automated tests — without ADB or complex setups/maintenance. A commercial product could pay people per hour of device use, allowing anyone to utilize idle device time. Each device is subsumed to provide a distributed testbed.</p><p>DART is orthogonal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_testing">crowdsourced testing</a> — the latter requires active human participation.</p><p>DART seems to be the best solution to utilize device idle time — the best way to verify that an app works on "Samsung S9" is by executing it on "Samsung S9".

Nondistributed device farms favor depth instead of breadth — maintenance cost increases as more diverse devices are added.</p><p>Testing on flagship devices alone doesn't always suffice.</p><blockquote><p>Anecdote: I once spent an entire day debugging an ANR that occurs to a small fraction of our users. I discovered it only affects phones purchased in specific regions. I never was able to reproduce the issue on the same phone bought in the USA.</p></blockquote><p>The Android version distribution exacerbates this problem.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><a href="https://www.headspin.io/">Headspin</a> aims to alleviate some of these issues. They claim to have a global infrastructure of more than 22,000 SIM-enabled (similar) devices in 150 locations. A big plus as traditional services (like Firebase Testlabs) can't handle geographical concerns. At Headspin's core is the <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf">DeviceFarmer STF</a> open-source library. But like its predecessors, Headspin only supports a limited set of device models.</p><h5>ii. 💸 Expensive Physical Devices</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/457ab6ec0d4f4335573264b78937f40d/real_device_pricing_chart.svg"><p>Real device test farms have an initial cost and require periodic maintenance, hence why they are more expensive than virtual device farms.</p><blockquote><p>Running 10 hours of test daily on real devices costs <strong>$1000/month</strong> (assuming 20 working days of equal levels of productivity).</p></blockquote><h3>1.2. 📱 Product</h3><p><strong>The key 🔑:</strong> Uber averts enormous maintenance costs by not owning all the cars on its global network. Similarly, with a distributed network of test devices, extensive device coverage is attainable with minimal maintenance costs. For one or two co-located devices, maintenance isn't fastidious.</p><blockquote><p>From <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf#faq">DeviceFramer STF</a> FAQ: "Aside from a single early failure we had within only a few months, all of our devices were doing fine for about two years. However, having reached the 2-3 year mark, several devices have started to experience visibly expanded batteries <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->
In our experience, the system runs just fine most of the time, and any issues are mostly USB-related. You'll usually have to do something about once a week."</p></blockquote><p>Organizations can decide what type of tests are ideal for DART and if the network is made-up of single nodes or clusters of nodes. The simple taxonomy of android testing below should be helpful. <!-- -->[1]</p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/3c544343e6de6b0d393c6101c4359694/taxonomy_android_testing.svg" alt="Taxonomy of Android testing"><p>The network can be internal to an organization. An example: <code>X</code> devices stored in HQ, each employee can remotely contribute their test device into the system.</p><p>It can also be external to an organization. Imagine paying people <code>$1.5/hour</code> of device time. Assuming a device runs test overnight (thanks to timezone differences), the estimated monthly earning is <code>$240</code> (<code>$1.5 * 8 hours * 20 working days</code>).</p><blockquote><p>The median income in some countries is ~$400/month. </p></blockquote><p>Below is a demo of the <a href="https://github.com/Elvis10ten/dart">proof-of-concept</a>.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SotlhlwMDA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Currently, a simple dashboard renders the test summary.</p><div>

    </span></a></p><h5>ii. 👩🏽‍💻 Publisher Perspective</h5><p>The publisher cares about test fraud and product leaks.</p><p>Proof of work disincentivizes test fraud. The server can use device logs, screenshots, videos with UUID, and past executions to validate submitted work results. As this isn't watertight, it is best combined with other strategies: user verifications, <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet">device attestation</a>, randomization, and device throughput throttling.</p><p>Preventing product leaks is hard  — if it runs on a phone, any sufficiently motivated (&amp; knowledgeable) person can figure out a way to access objects. Three good-enough solutions are:</p><p>a. Running headless tests.</p><p>b. Using a private network of vetted devices.</p><p>c. Adopting only for binaries at the later end of the release pipeline.</p><h3>1.4. 🎃 Going Headless</h3><p>It is possible to obscure the application under test using a simple overlay. The video below shows the execution of the test cases of the Google IO 2019 app. On the right, the app interactions are invisible. Depending on the strategy, concealing actions do not affect screenshots or videos.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxwsoe3T8yE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With framework UI component wrappers, it is possible to borrow some ideas from <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/4db1f432b853152075923499768639e14403b73a/tools/layoutlib/README">Layoutlib</a> to offer a full headless solution. <code>Layoutlib</code> is a custom version of the android View framework designed to run inside Eclipse. The goal of the library is to provide layout rendering in Eclipse that are very close to their rendering on devices.</p><h3>1.5. 📦 Containerization</h3><p>Tests need to run in an isolated environment. A plugin framework like <a href="https://github.com/didi/VirtualAPK">VirtualAPK</a> can be built to offer a layer of isolation between apps and the OS. This works using the <code>DexClassLoader</code> and some reflection hacks to modify framework components. With this approach, apps can be seamlessly loaded &amp; unloaded without any user interaction.</p><p><span>

For instance, <code>addAssetPath</code> is called via reflection to make resources not bundled in an APK available for use.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Before I got into productivity and performance, I used to spend many hours online ingesting vast troves of digital content. My information diet ranged from inspirational TED talks to specialized podcasts, from blog posts found on Hacker News to ebooks shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’m deeply curious, and I gave in to new content as much as I could. What could be the harm?—I thought. I <em>loved</em> spending my time this way. It felt useful, it was fun, and it nurtured my self-image as a “smart guy” — all at the same time. Truly, a learning hack.</p>
<p>Turns out I wasn’t hacking anything: The learning wasn’t real.</p>
<p>A few months ago, doubts began to creep into my mind about the effectiveness of my habits.</p>
<p>While I’d amped up my information consumption, I wasn’t retaining most of it. My memory was behaving like a leaky bucket. Sure, I was spending tens of hours listening to politics on the radio. But when I tried to use any of those points in a conversation, I found that I didn’t actually know enough to make a coherent argument. <strong>I knew the surrounding context, but the moment I needed to get specific my argument would crumble</strong>. Same for many other topics: the more technical they were, the less retention I had.</p>
<p>Where did all that information go?</p>
<p>The problem lied in how I was seeing learning, and therefore how I was approaching it.</p>
<p>Learning is what turns information consumption into long-lasting knowledge. The two things are different: while information is ephemeral, true knowledge is foundational. If knowledge were a person, information would be its picture.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think of learning in <em>accretive</em> terms: if I stack up enough information, it will eventually turn into knowledge. We tend to judge the world in material terms, and if data were tangible, an indefinitely growing memory might be reasonable to assume. The more information I consume, the more information I store, the information data I can later retrieve. The more business newsletters I’ll read, the more I’ll know business.</p>
<p>However, this line of thinking wasn’t really applicable to my case: I was undoubtedly consuming many business newsletters each week, but that wasn’t translating into long-term business knowledge.</p>
<p>I spent the last eight months trying to find an answer to this riddle. It took me deep into the topic of meta-learning: How do humans learn? And how can we learn better in the digital information age?</p>
<h2 id="learning-must-be-effortful">Learning must be effortful</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for us, human memory does not resemble storage, and “passive accumulation” isn’t how learning happens.</p>
<p>The truth is that we retain information only when we put <em>serious effort</em> into the process of learning. The intrinsic effortfulness of learning is not just a byproduct of the core activity, like shortness of breath during running. On the contrary: it’s what <em>actually</em> <em>enables</em> it. The relationship is causal.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>I didn’t find a learning hack to avoid effort because there’s no such thing as easy learning: <strong>learning <em>must</em> be effortful in order for it to happen</strong>.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most is that learning is far more grounded in the physical world than I was comfortable admitting.</p>
<p>The most literal meaning of effort is <em>physical</em> effort (think of weight lifting at the gym). The same holds true with information retention: it works best when the process of assimilating it is <em>physically effortful</em>. Our memory shines when our learning is physical, visceral, and obvious, like the aching in your hands after a morning spent hand-writing.</p>
<p>Since they’re passive, easy, and exclusively digital, after this realization all my podcasts, e-books, audiobooks, newsletters, blog posts, videos, live webinars were suddenly deprived of their “<em>learning status</em>”. Instead, they assumed their proper place in my schedule as pure <em>entertainment</em> activities.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that digital products make it uniquely easy to trick yourself into thinking that you’re learning when you are actually being entertained.</p>
<p>What I still didn’t know was why our mind works like this. Is this just the current state of digital learning and teaching, or there’s actually a margin for <em>easy</em> learning to be found somewhere?</p>
<h2 id="the-neurology-of-learning">The neurology of learning</h2>
<p>I’m no expert in medicine, let alone neurology, but I did want to roughly understand what happens when we — as humans —&nbsp;create knowledge. Luckily I didn’t need profound medical expertise to get the gist of the matter.</p>
<p>Our brain is made of a web of interconnected neurons. The links between these neurons are called axons: long, slender projections of nerve fibers that transmit electrical impulses.</p>
<p>Around these axons, there’s an insulating membrane called myelin. It covers many neuronal axons and facilitates the propagation of electrical signals along neuronal circuits. The more myelin around an axon, the stronger and more connected the signal transmission will be.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_2.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Myelin is to neural transmissions as oxygen is to fire. It allows rapid information transfer over long distances, and it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261127">greatly increases</a> the speed of propagation of electric signals in our brain.</p>
<p>See it as water flowing through a pipe with dynamic, changing capacity. Pipes with greater capacity can move more water, more quickly than a small pipe or a slow drip. The more myelin supporting a neural connection, the easier it is to use that connection — and thus to use the skill or remember the topic associated with that connection</p>
<p>A key aspect of myelin is that it’s highly dynamic. It’s an integral component of our brain plasticity. So the question becomes: how is myelin generated, and why?</p>
<p>When we come across a new topic, new regions of the brain start activating. The more we use those new regions, the more myelin is synthesized, the easier that topic (or activity) gets.</p>
<p>We all know the old saying <em>practice makes perfect</em>. The more we use a certain region of our brain, the more our brain “prioritizes” and “hones” it. That is what leads to myelin: activity induces myelination, which leads to increased strength of connectivity and efficiency along those very neurons. It’s a self-reinforcing process.</p>
<p>In other words, it compounds.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_3.png"> 
</figure>

<p>See now why it’s so hard to learn? To learn anything we must make active use of unexplored regions of our brain <em>before</em> they’re ready. It’s, quite literally, getting out of the comfort zone. The more we use them, the more they get better. <strong>Learning is <em>structurally</em> hard.</strong></p>
<p>The truly mesmerizing thing about myelination is that it is correlated with active use of <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4351">motor neurons</a></em>. It looks like human cognition is fundamentally grounded in sensory-motor processes: we retain information better when we associate some <em>physical activity</em> to it. <strong>The general intuition is that movement provides additional cues we can use to retrieve knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>We can see this effect happening when we take notes. A larger corpus of research is suggesting that taking notes physically — that is, by hand-writing them — is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">far more effective</a> than using a laptop. Keyboarding does not provide tactile feedback to the brain that the contact between pencil and paper does: this contact, this raw feedback, is the key to creating the neurocircuitry in the hand-brain complex, that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">evidence shows</a> supports memory and retention.</p>
<p>All of this means <strong>we need to radically reassess digital learning</strong>. We haven’t evolved to store information by passively watching Masterclass videos: that’s just not how our minds work.</p>
<p>However, the other side of this coin is that we’re living in times of unprecedented information surplus. This is an opportunity that we should learn to seize.</p>
<h2 id="creative-learning-in-a-digital-world">Creative learning in a digital world</h2>
<p>The best way to describe my information diet before discovering that effort is instrumental to learning would be <em>edutainment</em>.</p>
<p>Edutainment mixes education topics with entertainment methodologies. Even if edutainment optimizes for passive attention instead of effortful engagement (the opposite of learning), it’s not just “mere fun.” Deleting Twitter and unsubscribing from newsletters, as suggested by Deep Work advocates like <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a>, can actually end up <em>preventing</em> learning.</p>
<p>I see edutainment as <em>preparation for learning</em>: it’s a powerful explorative tool that can provide ideas and motivation to learn. And yet, it’s also not learning itself, in the same way as buying running shoes is not running.</p>
<p>Within this framework, “mindless” browsing online can be transformed into <em>scouting for learning opportunities</em>. It’s yet another searching problem where it’s key to balance the exploration of new opportunities with the commitment to the existing ones — a topic I wrote about at length in <a href="https://giansegato.com/essays/the-ebb-and-the-flow-of-product-development/">another essay</a>. It’s about balancing the time spent “scouting” for interesting topics online with the offline effort needed for long-term retention and integration.</p>
<hr>


<hr>
<p>Pragmatically, I solved this trade-off with a powerful tool: a learning inbox.</p>
<p>A learning inbox is a to-do list for stuff I’d like to actually learn. I picked up the idea from Andy Matuschak — legendary ed-tech expert —, who <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/A_reading_inbox_to_capture_possibly-useful_references">used a similar concept</a> as a tool for capturing possibly-useful references. The learning inbox is a system that forces me to be mindful about what content is <em>learning</em>, and what is at the end of the day just <em>entertainment</em>.</p>
<p>Everything interesting I find on my way is sent to my learning inbox and from there gets triaged, be it a paper, an online essay, a blog post, a YouTube video, or a podcast. When an item ends up in there, there are three things that can happen: I either decide to actively engage with it, to file for future interest, or just trash it. Active engagement is exactly what it sounds like: <strong>I need to take effortful action to consume the content in the list</strong>, otherwise I automatically bucket it as entertainment.</p>
<p>In other words, I need to do something with it. To <em>create</em> something. Write a blog post about it, use it in a new project, test it on the field, teach it at a meetup. That’s why I speak at <a href="https://giansegato.com/about/#talks">many conferences</a>: it’s a learning tool.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD fashion</a>, permanence in this list is temporary. It’s a release valve, not a …</p></div></div>

  <section>
    <p>Following our <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">efforts to bring elementary OS to the ARM-based Pinebook Pro</a>, we’ve added experimental builds for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 4 series—including the recently-launched Raspberry Pi 400—to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> program. Like Pinebook Pro builds, Raspberry Pi support is considered an experiment and is not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. However, if you’re one of the many folks with a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around and wanted to see how a full, modern desktop operating system runs, elementary OS is now an option!</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi/desktop.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS"></p>
  <figcaption>My current desktop, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Personally, I typically use Raspberry Pi 4 as a network device, e.g. a DNS server and for network-attached storage. However, I’ve been using elementary OS builds on it for the past week, and I’m impressed. While it won’t compete experience-wise with a high end desktop, it is a real option for casual computing, development, and writing. In fact, this blog post was written entirely on my Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS. It would even be possible to run the same network services on the hardware from within elementary OS just so you get a nice modern GUI when doing any local management.</p>

<p>Like with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a>, there are some things you should know if you plan to use elementary OS Early Access builds on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu has released Raspberry Pi images, we are able to rely on that work to ship a supported and updated kernel. Thanks to all of the folks at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community who have worked to make that happen!</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>elementary OS on Raspberry Pi 4 is not going to match the polished experience of a full modern desktop computer, largely due to our current software stack. GTK3 does not offer GPU-accelerated animations, so animations within apps are less smooth than we would like. Still, for a computer coming in at under $100, it’s impressive and perfectly usable for several tasks.</p>

<p>There are also some things you can do to improve performance. We would definitely recommend using some sort of cooling with your Raspberry Pi, whether that’s a a heatsink and fan (like the recently-announced <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">Raspberry Pi 4 Case Fan</a>), or a passive case like one from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://flirc.tv/">Flirc</a>—my favorite for its looks and silence. Since Raspberry Pi 4 tends to throttle due to heat under desktop loads, cooling will help it stay more responsive. We also recommend trying USB3 storage as your boot drive, as it should be faster than a microSD card. Using a 1080p (or lower) resolution also works a fair bit better than trying to push a 1440p or 4K display, but your mileage may vary based on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="supported-raspberry-pi-models">Supported Raspberry Pi Models</h2>

<p>We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 400 with 4 GB RAM at a minimum—but the more, the better. (We don’t even recommend less than 8 GB for computers with much faster CPUs, graphics, and storage.)</p>

<p>Older models of Raspberry Pi (like the original, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 series, and Raspberry Pi 3 series) are not supported; elementary OS requires the faster processor, additional RAM, and 64-bit architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4 series. For older models, we recommend sticking to Raspberry Pi OS or a “headless” OS like Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="run-elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>In its current state, we would not consider elementary OS on Raspberry Pi as polished of an experience as running on well-supported AMD- or Intel-based hardware.</p>

<p>That said, the audience for Raspberry Pi leans toward tinkerers and experimenters; as such, we’ve decided to publish our builds under our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access builds</a> program. This means dedicated <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">sponsors</a> of elementary OS who wish to run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi can download it from the same place as Early Access builds of elementary OS. As a note, all of this work has been focused on bringing the <strong>pre-release of elementary OS 6</strong> to Raspberry Pi, so all the usual disclaimers about pre-release builds apply here as well.</p>



<p>Once you have access to Early Access builds, head over to the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Raspberry-Pi">elementary OS wiki</a> to get it installed on your own hardware. If you find and file any issues, please remember to specify the build of the OS you downloaded as well as that you are running on Raspberry Pi—it will help us validate and triage issues much more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-andrew-david-hewitt-and-marius-meisenzahl">Thanks to Andrew, David Hewitt, and Marius Meisenzahl</h2>

<p>Bringing elementary OS to Raspberry Pi was a collaborative effort. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrewc910">Andrew</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a> specifically worked to prototype, improve, and ultimately ship these builds. And of course countless folks across the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian, Canonical, Ubuntu, and more have worked for years on making the underlying system work well for us to build on.</p>

		<p>It has been almost two years since Talos was first announced to the world. ARM support was almost immediately a feature request. At the time the project had major features missing that needed to be implemented before we could even <em>think</em> about Talos on ARM. Only after forming a company, hiring a kick ass team, and pouring a tremendous amount of time and love into Talos have we finally been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>The Talos team is proud to announce support for four ARM single board computers (SBCs) in our latest alpha release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</li>
<li>Pine64 Rock64</li>
<li>Banana Pi M64</li>
<li>Libre Computer ALL-H3-CC H5 (Tritium)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those not familiar with Talos, it is an ultra minimal OS with an API instead of ssh+shell built for the purpose of running Kubernetes with security as a priority. The image is immutable, the runtime is ephemeral, and the configuration is declarative. For more on what all of this means, see our documentation at <a href="https://www.talos.dev/">https://www.talos.dev/</a>. We think you will love it.</p>
<p>Landing support for SBCs signifies a huge milestone for Talos. You can now run Talos nearly anywhere you can imagine. The same Talos is able to run in the cloud, on-premise, and now at the edge. This means you get a resource efficient, secure, and reliable OS running the same vanilla Kubernetes that you run in production datacenters - wherever you might need it.</p>
<p>We are looking to add support for more boards. Please, let us know what boards you might be interested in by creating an issue in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/talos-systems/talos">repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example/blob/01e0aae91f83e1e932f4498a0eddb2905c8fffc3/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L57-L63">This</a>
is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>
tool with the rest of the world in order to avoid this pain to as many people as possible. 😅</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoIeni">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MarcoIeni">YouTube</a>, bye! 👋</p>

                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

<h2>A Compendium of 58 Effective Strategies, Techniques and Methods</h2>

<p>Managing your own time is an essential skill in today’s fast-paced world. It's also more challenging than ever. Fortunately, there are many <strong>time management strategies that can help you become organized and efficient</strong>. Use this overview of 58 strategies and techniques to find the ones that work best for you.</p>
<!-- It’s hard to keep track of all the time management strategies out there. Productivity gurus tend to create their own, building on the massive fundus of existing strategies. So to get you ready for the next time someone mentions their favorite but obscure time management technique, here is an exhaustive overview of more than 50 strategies. -->
<h2>Deep Planning</h2>
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/funktionsgrafik-play-store-2019-10-18.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve"/> -->
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/values-finder-banner.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve" style="max-width: 100%"/> -->

<!-- Did we just complain about everybody creating their own time management strategy? Well, obviously it’s all right if we do it, isn’t it? :) -->
<p>Most plans are strictly sequential. When you invariably have to adjust your plan to reality, you have to update the whole lengthy sequence. Time-consuming at best, motivation consuming at worst. With deep planning, you create a simple hierarchy instead.</p>
<p>Think about what you want to achieve this year. Based on that, what do you want to achieve this month? This week? Today? This way you create a long-term strategy and still adjust your plans with little effort.</p>
<!-- At the end of each period, take a step back and reflect. What went well? What not? What can I do differently next time? -->
<p>Curious? Then take a look at <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/time-management-app/">Focality, our time management app</a>. Focality combines deep planning, self-reflection and data-driven insights to let you constantly improve your time management skills.</p>
<h2>The complete list of time management strategies</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here comes the complete list of time management techniques in alphabetic order:</p>
<h3>1-3-5 rule</h3>
<p>For every day, create a list of one big thing, three medium things and five small things that you want to accomplish this day. This brings clarity into your workday and helps not to get buried by an endless flood of to-do items.</p>
<h3>2-Hour Solution</h3>
<p>See Two-Hour Solution.</p>
<h3>2-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>There are two 2-Minute Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you want to establish a new habit, make sure that it requires no more than 2 minutes in the beginning. Work yourself up from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Getting Things Done methodology (see below), if a task takes only 2 minutes or less, then do it right away instead of organizing it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>10-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>If you are putting something off, force yourself to do it for just 10 minutes. Chances are that you will continue past the 10 minutes.</p>
<h3>18 Minutes</h3>
<p>Start your day by planning what you will do that day for 5 minutes. Every hour, take one minute, review your progress and refocus. At the end of the day, take 5 minutes to reflect and evaluate your day.</p>
<h3>4Ds of Time Management</h3>
<p>This method helps you to quickly decide what to do with a task. Either Do it, Defer it, Delegate it or Drop it.</p>
<h3>7 Minute Life</h3>
<p>Spend 7 minutes in the morning to plan your day. Then another 7 minutes in the evening to reflect. Accompanied by many <a href="https://the7minutelife.com/member-tools/">templates</a>.</p>
<h3>80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a rule of thumb that states that 80% of the effect step from 20% of the causes. Applied to time management it means that you can get 80% of the results with just 20% of the work. Getting to 100% will require disproportionately more work. Perfect is the enemy of done.</p>
<h3>90-Minute Rule / 90-Minute Focus Sessions / 90-Minute Solution</h3>
<p>Align your work with your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest%E2%80%93activity_cycle">basic rest–activity cycle</a> by doing focused work for approximately 90 minutes, followed by a 20-minute break. The following article sums it up nicely: <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/avoid-burnout-and-increase-awareness-using-ultradian-rhythms-5e64158e7e19">Avoid Burnout and Increase Awareness Using Ultradian Rhythms</a></p>
<h3>ABCDE Method</h3>
<p>Created by Brian Tracy, ABCDE is a method for setting priorities. Basically assign each task a priority from A to E. A: Very important, must do. B: Important, should do. C: Nice to do, without consequence if skipped. D: Delegate. E: Eliminate.</p>
<h3>Action Method</h3>
<p>Leave every meeting, workshop or other event with a set of concrete tasks that need to be performed, called “action steps”. These should be kept separately from accompanying information (“reference items”). Everything that can’t / shouldn’t be approached right now becomes a “backburner item” to be possibly revived later. The method was developed by Behance. There used to be an online tool that implemented the action method, but it  was discontinued in 2015.</p>
<h3>Agile Results</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/">Agile Results</a> technique is heavily inspired by software development frameworks like Scrum. At the beginning of the week, identify three wins that you want to achieve. Each day, identify three wins for that day. Use Fridays to recognize three things that are going well and three things to improve. Accompanied by a set of further practices to improve your time management like 30 day improvement sprints, reference collections and more.</p>
<h3>Autofocus</h3>
<p><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Autofocus</a> is a to-do list methodology by Mark Forster which tries to use as little structure as possible. Dump everything in a ruled notebook. Scan your list and work on what stands out for as long as you feel like it. Then cross the item off the list. If you haven’t finished it, add it to the bottom again. Repeat. If you pass through a whole page (except the latest page) without anything standing out, dismiss all items on that page.</p>
<h3>Batching / Time Batching / Task Batching</h3>
<p>Work on batches of similar tasks instead of mixing unrelated ones. It reduces friction by minimizing context switching.</p>
<h3>Biological Prime Time</h3>
<p>Track your energy levels and identify your most energetic times of the day. Schedule your most important work for those times. First described by Sam Carpenter in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6019060-work-the-system">Work the System</a>.</p>
<h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
<p>A bullet journal combines to-do list, planning and journaling. The name bullet journal comes from the extensive use of bullet(ish) points to structure and mark information.</p>
<h3>COPE</h3>
<p>The Clear-Organized-Productive-Efficient technique helps you to eliminate low-value activities and prioritize everything so that you can focus on the things with the most impact.</p>
<h3>Don’t break the chain</h3>
<p>See Seinfeld Strategy.</p>
<h3>Eat That Frog</h3>
<p>Tackle the biggest and/or most difficult and/or most disliked task first thing in the morning. Then you won’t waste energy or distract yourself the rest of the day because you are secretly dreading that task. <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/">Eat That Frog</a> was created by Brian Tracy who named it after a quote by Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Matrix / Box / Method / Principle</h3>
<p>Former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower used to rate his problems by the two criteria urgency and importance. These criteria are commonly used as axis on a 2x2 matrix with 4 quadrants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Urgent and important</li>
<li>Not urgent and important</li>
<li>Urgent but not important</li>
<li>Not urgent and not important</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eisenhower Matrix helps you to better prioritize your tasks and avoid the urgency trap where you fill your day with everything that’s urgent and neglecting the important.</p>
<h3>Final Version</h3>
<p>Start with a list of tasks. Select the first one on the list. Think about which other task from the list you would rather do. Select that one but remember/mark the first. Repeat until you no longer want to do anything before the currently selected task. Then work on the tasks in this chain - but in reverse order! Once you are done with the chain start the process again with the next open task on the list. Reference: <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html">The Final Version newsletter</a></p>
<h3>Flowtime Technique</h3>
<p>Work on only one task at a time. When you start, write down the time. Continue working on the task until you feel that you need a break. If you are exhausted or can’t focus anymore, take a break. Write down the stop time. Decide how long this break should be and set a timer for it. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Fresh or Fried</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, when your brain is fried, prioritize your tasks for the next day. Schedule important tasks to the beginning of the day, when your brain is still fresh. Schedule less important or easier tasks towards the later parts of the day when your brain fries again.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://thefyslife.com/article/fresh-or-fried-productivity/">Dominate Your Day With the “Fresh or Fried” Prioritization System</a></p>
<h3>Getting Things Done (GTD)</h3>
<p>Getting Things Done is a famous method created by David Allen. It makes extensive use of to-do lists and techniques to manage them. At its core it employs five basic activities to bring structure to your task management:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture everything: Don’t keep tasks in your head, write everything down.</li>
<li>Clarify: Make sure all your items are clear and actionable.</li>
<li>Organize: Use categories, priorities and due dates to bring structure to your lists.</li>
<li>Review: Frequently go over your lists. Update priorities, remove outdated items, etc.</li>
<li>Engage: Do it.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">Goal Setting</a></h3>
<p>Goal setting is the process of defining what you want to achieve in the long-term (or mid-term). Instead of focusing just on tasks, it helps you getting direction in life. If you don’t have clear goals, you are basically adrift. And you hardly get to where you want to be by accident.</p>
<p>We have compiled an <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">extensive guide to personal goal setting</a> which will help you to understand the topic in depth. Learn why it is important, what types of goals to set, attributes of well-defined goals and much, much more.</p>
<h3>Inbox Zero</h3>
<p>This strategy focuses on managing your email inbox with maximum efficiency. According to its creator, Merlin Mann, the name Inbox Zero does not refer to the number of emails in your inbox, but “how long it takes to use the inbox”. Basically, you run every incoming email through a short process in which you do one of the following things: Delete, delegate, respond, defer (to do later), do (immediately).</p>
<h3>Ivy Lee Method</h3>
<p>This time management strategy has been created in 1918 by productivity consultant Ivy Lee. He recommends writing down six tasks at the end of each day that you want to accomplish the next day. Order them by importance. Then, on the next day, work your way down the list. At the end of the day, move any uncompleted task to the list for the next day. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Medium Method</h3>
<p>Combine the strengths of digital and paper tools. Chad Hall’s <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/medium-method">Medium Method</a> employs paper notebooks, post-it notes, a task-management app, an online calendar and a note app.</p>
<h3>MIT: Most Important Tasks</h3>
<p>Write down the most important tasks for the next day. Up to three. At the beginning of the day, focus on those and do nothing else until your MITs are completed.</p>
<h3>MoSCow Prioritization</h3>
<p>Borrowed from requirements management this technique helps you prioritize your tasks. Give each task a priority of …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                        <h3>Abstract</h3>
                        
                        
                            <p>It has been claimed that left-wingers or liberals (US sense) tend to more often suffer from mental illness than right-wingers or conservatives. This potential link was investigated using the General Social Survey cumulative cross-sectional dataset (1972-2018). A search of the available variables resulted in 5 items measuring one's own mental illness (e.g., ”Do you have any emotional or mental disability?”). All of these items were weakly associated with left-wing political ideology as measured by self-report, with especially high rates seen for the “extremely liberal” group. These results mostly held up in regressions that adjusted for age, sex, and race. For the variable with the most data (n = 11,338), the difference in the mental illness measure between “extremely liberal” and “extremely conservative” was 0.39 d. Temporal analysis showed that the relationship between mental illness, happiness, and political ideology has existed in the GSS data since the 1970s and still existed in the 2010s. Within-study meta-analysis of all the results found that extreme liberals had a 150% increased rate of mental illness compared to moderates. The finding of increased mental illness among left-wingers is congruent with numerous findings based on related constructs, such as positive relationships between conservatism, religiousness and health in general.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is going to be a quick tour of the essential aspects of <code>stack</code> targeted at beginners. It will not only list commands that should be executed but would try to provide contextual explanations as much as possible. The aim is to give an introduction to <code>stack</code> that is not filled with commands to be memorized but one that can help the beginner to start forming a better understanding of <code>stack</code> so they can explore the tool further on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clarifying-terms">Clarifying terms</h2>

<p>It is important to have an understanding of some basic terms and concepts when it comes to working and building Haskell programs. This includes understanding what is meant when we say things like <em>Cabal</em>, the difference between <em>Modules, Libraries, Packages</em>, etc. These terms were already explained in the previous post, so instead of reproducing it again here, please take a moment to read the <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> in the Whirlwind Tour Of Cabal For Beginners post.</p>

<p>One thing to point out regarding the concepts of packages and projects is that <code>stack</code> provides configuration for projects via a file called <code>stack.yaml</code>, while packages are configured via either <code>package.yaml</code> file or <code>.cabal</code> file. These files are covered in more depth in <a href="#creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="what-stack-is">What Stack is</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> is a build tool for Haskell. It is an alternative to <code>cabal-install</code>, but still makes use of cabal the package format and Cabal the library. It has a strong focus on reproducible build plans. It was conceived to solve dependency problems (commonly referred to as cabal hell) that used to plague <code>cabal-install</code>. It does this by providing a curated package set that is guaranteed to always compile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be stressed that the cabal hell issue that used to plague cabal-install has mostly been resolved. The solution took a different approach than what <code>stack</code> employed. It made use of an approach similar to what is obtained in Nix. The details of this are not important, just that using either <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>is now a matter of preference and UX choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="moving-parts">Moving parts</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> also comes with some moving parts and terms that could be confusing to a beginner. In this section, these terms are explained before moving to how to install <code>stack</code>.</p>

<h3 id="curated-package-set">Curated Package Set</h3>

<p>Hackage is Haskell’s central package archive of open-source software. Anyone can upload (and also download) packages from Hackage hence it contains different versions of packages that are not guaranteed to be compatible. A curated package set is then a subset of packages from Hackage which are regularly tested for compatibility. <code>stack</code> makes use of the idea of a curated package set to resolve the problem of incompatible dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="stackage">Stackage</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> is the central package archive of open-source software of Haskell packages <strong>that have been curated and tested for compatibility</strong>. Hence the curated package set used by <code>stack</code> is hosted on Stackage. Stackage is spearheaded by folks at <a href="http://www.fpcomplete.com/">fpcomplete</a>, but is still a community effort, hence anyone can also <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md#adding-a-package">submit packages</a> for inclusion in the curated package set that is hosted on Stackage.</p>

<h3 id="resolver">Resolver</h3>

<p>It is easy to imagine the need for versioning when working with these curated package sets hosted on Stackage. Where a particular version uniquely identifies a particular curated package set and the packages it contains. In <code>stack</code>, the version of a curated package set is referred to or specified as a <em>resolver</em>.</p>

<p>A resolver uniquely identifies the GHC version and the other Haskell packages contained within a package set. Package sets that have been thoroughly tested and would be maintained for a long period are identified by LTS (long term support) resolver version numbers, while package sets that are still in flux are identified by nightly resolvers. The available LTS resolvers can be found <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts">here</a> while nightly resolvers can be seen <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly">here</a>. For example <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts-16.22">lts-16.22</a>, is a LTS Resolver, while <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2020-11-19">nightly-2020-11-19</a> is a nightly Resolver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on its name, it might be tempting to think of resolver as a piece of software that performs the act of resolution. A better way is to see the resolver as an identifier or a tag. It is a way to refer to a particular curated package set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hpack">hpack</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> Haskell makes use of cabal package format, a text-based, key-value format used to describe a Haskell package. <code>hpack</code> is an alternate format to cabal package format. Instead of a custom key-value text-based format, it makes use of <a href="https://yaml.org/"><code>yaml</code></a>.</p>

<p>So while the cabal package format uses a custom key-value text-based format specified in a file ending with <code>.cabal</code> extension, <code>hpack</code> uses <code>yaml</code> with package descriptions specified in <code>package.yaml</code> file. <code>stack</code>has inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code>. This means <code>stack</code>can parse <code>hpack</code>s’ <code>package.yaml</code> and use it to generate <code>.cabal</code> file.</p>

<p>In summary, you can view <code>stack</code>as a Haskell build tool, that makes use of curated package sets, identified by resolvers and hosted on Stackage, with inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code> as an alternative package specification format.</p>

<h2 id="installing-stack">Installing Stack</h2>

<p>Installing <code>stack</code>is straight forward. On Un*x operating systems, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On windows, the provided <a href="https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe">Windows Installer</a> can be used</p>

<p>To confirm <code>stack</code>is properly installed run <code>stack --version</code> which will give an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack <span>--version</span>
Version 2.3.3, Git revision cb44d51bed48b723a5deb08c3348c0b3ccfc437e x86_64 hpack-0.33.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that you do not need to install GHC separately when using <code>stack</code>. <code>stack</code>handles getting the version of GHC needed for each project created. This is also one of the ways in which <code>stack</code>differs from <code>cabal-install</code> which requires GHC to be separately downloaded and installed. So <code>stack</code>not only takes care of resolving dependencies, compiling Haskell code, it also handles the management of the toolchain required to do this, and GHC is included in the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>

<p>Now we have <code>stack</code>installed, the next thing to do is to create a new Haskell project. Doing this is straightforward. To create a new project, run <code>stack new</code>.</p>

<p>Doing so will produce an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack new firstproject
Downloading template <span>"new-template"</span> to create project <span>"firstproject"</span> <span>in </span>firstproject/ ...

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-name
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-name: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span>

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-email, author-name, category, copyright, github-username
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-email: value
    author-name: value
    category: value
    copyright: value
    github-username: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-email:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"category:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"copyright:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"github-username:value"</span>

Looking <span>for</span> .cabal or package.yaml files to use to init the project.
Using cabal packages:
- firstproject/

Selecting the best among 18 snapshots...

<span>*</span> Matches lts-16.22

Selected resolver: lts-16.22
Initialising configuration using resolver: lts-16.22
Total number of user packages considered: 1
Writing configuration to file: firstproject/stack.yaml
All <span>done</span><span>.</span>
/Users/schooloffp/.stack/templates/new-template.hsfiles:    3.72 KiB downloaded...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above command will create a directory named <code>firstproject</code> with will contain the source files for the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above command creates a project based on a default template which dictates the default files and configuration that will be created. It should be noted that it is possible to pass an extra option together with <code>new</code> that specifies the template that <code>stack</code>should use to create a new project. When the template option is left out, <code>stack</code>uses the <code>new-template</code> template by default. Hence <code>stack new firstproject</code> is same as running <code>stack new firstproject new-template</code>. Run <code>stack templates</code> to see the available templates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state of the directory after running <code>stack new firstproject</code> can be seen:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>tree firstproject/
firstproject/
├── ChangeLog.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── Setup.hs
├── app
│   └── Main.hs
├── firstproject.cabal
├── package.yaml
├── src
│   └── Lib.hs
├── stack.yaml
└── <span>test</span>
    └── Spec.hs
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s take a pause to talk about the files generated after running the <code>stack new</code> command.</p>

<h3 id="changelogmd">ChangeLog.md</h3>

<p>As is evident in the name, this is a markdown file that should be used to capture the revision history for the project.</p>

<h3 id="license">LICENSE</h3>

<p>This is where the license governing the project is specified, as also evident in the name.</p>

<h3 id="readmemd">README.md</h3>

<p>The well-known README file.</p>

<h3 id="setuphs">Setup.hs</h3>
<p>The <code>Setup.hs</code> file comes in handy in the scenario where one needs to circumvent tools like <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>for direct usage of the Cabal library when compiling Cabal packages. The <code>Setup.hs</code> is, in essence, a runnable Haskell program that can be further configured and used to compile Cabal packages.</p>

<p>This is an exceptional use case. Everyday Haskell development would …</p></div></div>

In this article, I'll be discussing some of the studies that have covered this subject along with some of the solutions to reduce the amount of blue light you're being subjected to.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-cpun"><span>What is Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bj5bp"><span>Sunlight is composed of red, yellow, orange, green, and blue light rays and many shades of each of these colours, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual rays (otherwise known as <!-- -->electromagnetic radiation<!-- -->). Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

During the study, some participants were instructed to wear special glasses that blocked blue light wavelengths whilst the rest didn't. The results showed that the people in the study that wore these glasses produced more melatonin than those who didn’t and hence, had a better night's sleep.</span></p><p id="viewer-8nqqi"><span>These studies do seem pretty conclusive, however since then others have said otherwise.</span></p><p id="viewer-8kim"><span>In 2019, a group of researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31368-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>challenged that notion</u></a>. After exposing mice to lights that were different in hue but equal brightness and assessing their subsequent activity, the researchers concluded that yellow light actually seems to disturb sleep more than blue. Warm-toned light, they hypothesized, could trick the body into thinking it’s daytime, while cooler blue light more closely mimics twilight.</span></p><p id="viewer-7o6g0"><span>It is important to note however, that animals studies don't always reflect the entire reality, as they often can't translate directly to human behavior. Furthermore, since rodents are nocturnal, they may respond differently to light than humans do. Finally the lights were also kept very dim, regardless of color, which may not property represent the bright lights of electronics.</span></p><p id="viewer-b6bbs"><span>Because of these conditions, the results of the study can't be taken too seriously, given how many previous ones have concluded that Blue Light has a negative impact on sleep.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-2fn3f"><span>How to minimise the effects </span></h3><p id="viewer-ctu4b"><span>If you're worried that Blue Light might be affecting your sleep, here are a few solutions:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-fljja"><p>First of all, try and <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cut down on your screen time</u></a>. By doing this you'll be subjecting your eyes to less Blue Light from being on your computer or smartphone. <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Here's an article</u></a> I wrote to help reduce screen time and stay active.</p></li><li id="viewer-9htd6"><p>Try not to look at your devices just before bed.

If you think you'll forget to wear your glasses then blue light screen protectors can be a useful alternative seeing as you only need to apply it once.</p></li><li id="viewer-fnvc5"><p>Use different lights: LED light bulbs in your house can also emit blue light, so instead of using bright white lights, you could try switching to dimmer red lights closer to bedtime so you are exposed to less blue light.</p></li></ol><h3 id="viewer-82ggv"><span>The bottom line</span></h3><p id="viewer-1fhfe"><span>The bottom line is that most studies conclude that too much Blue Light, especially in the evening, can have a negative impact on your sleep.

<p>The C++, eh C, preprocessor is wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, no - it isn’t wonderful.</p>
<p>It is a primitive text replacement tool that must be used to work with C++.
But is “must” really true?
Most of the usage has become obsolete thanks to new and better C++ language features.
And many more features like modules will come soon™.
So can we get rid of the preprocessor?
And if so, how can we do it?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Much of the preprocessor use is already bad practice:
Don’t use it for symbolic constants, don’t use it for inline functions etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this gained a lot of traction, let me clarify something:
I’m not advocating for removing the preprocessor with this post.
Some people in the C++ community and many on the standardization committee want to do that, however,
so I wanted to explore the feasibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there still a few ways it is used in idiomatic C++.
Let’s go through them and see what alternative we have.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the most common usage:
<code>#include</code> a header file.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>In order to compile a source file, the compiler needs to see the declarations of all functions that are being called.
So if you define a function in one file,
and want to call it in another, you have to declare it in that file as well.
Only then can the compiler generate the appropriate code to call the function.</p>
<p>Of course, manually copying the declaration can lead to errors:
If you change the signature you have to change all declarations as well.
So, instead of manually copying the declarations,
you write them in a special file - the header file,
and let the preprocessor copy it for you with <code>#include</code>.
Now you still need to update all declarations, but just in one place.</p>
<p>But plain text inclusion is dumb.
It can sometimes happens that the same file gets included twice,
which leads to two copies of that file.
This is no problem for function declarations,
but if you have class definitions in an header file,
that’s an error.</p>
<p>To prevent that, you have to use include guards or the non-standard <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>With current C++ features, we can’t (without resorting to copy pasta).</p>
<p>But with the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4647.pdf">Modules TS</a> we can.
Instead of providing header files and source files,
we can write a module and <code>import</code> that.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about modules, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjvh127abfw">most recent CppChat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation">Conditional Compilation</h2>
<p>The second most common job of the preprocessor is conditional compilation:
Change the definitions/declarations by defining or not defining a macro.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed-1">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>Consider the situation where you’re writing a library that provides a function <code>draw_triangle()</code>
which draws a single triangle on the screen.</p>
<p>Now the declaration is straightforward:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// draws a single triangle
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But the implementation of the function changes depending on your operating system, window manager, display manager
and/or moon phase (for exotic window manager).</p>
<p>So you need something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// use this one for Windows
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using the WinAPI 
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using DirectX
</span><span></span><span>}</span>

<span>// use this one for Linux
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using X11
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using OpenGL
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The preprocessor helps there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if _WIN32
</span><span></span>    <span>// Windows triangle drawing code here 
</span><span></span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>// Linux triangle drawing code here
</span><span></span><span>#endif
</span></code></pre></div><p>The code in the branch that is not taken will be deleted before compilation,
so we won’t get any errors about missing APIs etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-1">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>C++17 adds <code>if constexpr</code>, this can be used to replace simple <code>#if … #else</code>:</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>#if DEBUG_MODE
</span><span></span>        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>#endif
</span><span></span>    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can write this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>DEBUG_MODE</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> is <code>false</code>, then the branch will not be compiled properly,
it will only check for syntax errors, similar to the checking done for a not yet instantiated template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not correct, as was pointed out.
It will still be fully checked if outside a template.
It doesn’t matter here though, as it still doesn’t have any runtime overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is even better than <code>#if</code> as it will spot obvious errors in the code without checking all macro combinations.
Another benefit with <code>if constexpr</code> is that <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> can now be a normal <code>constexpr</code> variable,
instead of a constant coming from a macro expansion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you don’t have <code>if constexpr</code>, you can use class template specializations,
or <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2015/11/16/overload-resolution-3.html">tag dispatching</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are downsides to <code>if constexpr</code>:
You can’t use it to constrain preprocessor directives, i.e. <code>#include</code>.
For the <code>draw_triangle()</code> example, the code needs to include the proper system header.
<code>if constexpr</code> can help, so you’d need true conditional compilation there or manually copy the declarations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is better than normally as system header declarations are usually pretty stable.
But it’s still not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And modules can’t help either as the system headers do not define any module you can import.
Furthermore, you can’t conditionally import a module (as far as I know).</p>
<h2 id="passing-configuration-options">Passing configuration options</h2>
<p>On a related note, you sometimes want to pass some configuration options to a library.
You might want to enable or disable assertions, precondition checks, change some default behavior…</p>
<p>For example, it might have a header like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#ifndef USE_ASSERTIONS
</span><span></span>    <span>// default to enable
</span><span></span>    <span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 1
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>#ifndef DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION
</span><span></span>    <span>// use the general implementation
</span><span></span>    <span>#define DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION general_foo
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When building the library you can then override the macros either when invoking the compiler,
or through CMake, for example.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-2">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>Macros are the obvious choice here, but there are is an alternative:</p>
<p>We could use a different strategy to pass options,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design">policy-based design</a>,
where you pass a policy to a class template that defines the chosen behavior.
This has the benefit that it doesn’t force a single implementation to all users,
but of course has <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2017/02/08/policy-based-design-problem.html">its own downsides</a>.</p>
<p>But what I’d really like to see is the ability to pass these configuration options when you <code>import</code> the module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>import</span> <span>my</span><span>.</span><span>module</span><span>(</span><span>use_assertions</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This would be the ideal replacement for:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 0
</span><span>#include</span> <span>"my_library.hpp"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>But I don’t think that’s technically feasible without sacrificing the benefits modules provide,
i.e. pre-compiling modules.</p>
<h2 id="assertion-macros">Assertion macros</h2>
<p>The macro you’ll most commonly use probably does some kind of assertion.
And macros are the obvious choice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to conditionally disable assertions and remove them so they have zero overhead in release.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can use the pre-defined <code>__LINE__</code>, <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__func__</code> to get the location where the assertion is
and use that in the diagnostic.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can also stringify the expression that is being checked and use it in the diagnostic as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why almost all assertions are macros.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-3">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>I’ve already explored how conditional compilation can be replaced and how you can specify whether or not they should be enabled,
so that’s no problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using policy-based design here also allows customization of how the diagnostic is reported to the user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting the file information is also possible in the Library Fundamentals TS v2 as it adds <code>std::experimental::source_location</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>my_assertion</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span> <span>loc</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>())</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
        <span>report_error</span><span>(</span><span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>file_name</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>function_name</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>std::experimental::source_location::current()</code> expands to the information about the source file at the point of writing it.
Furthermore, if you use it as a default argument, it will expand to the caller location.
So the second point is no problem either.</p>
<p>The third point is the critical one:
You can’t stringify the expression and print it in the diagnostic without using a macro.
If you’re okay with that, you can implement your assertion function today.</p>
<p>But otherwise you still need a macro for that.
Check out <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2016/09/16/assertions.html">this blog post</a> how you could implement an (almost) macro-less assertion function,
where you can control the level with <code>constexpr</code> variables instead of macros.
You can find the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/foonathan/debug_assert">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-macros">Compatibility macros</h2>
<p>Not all compilers support all C++ features, which makes porting a real pain,
especially if you don’t have access to a compiler for a testing and need to do the “change a line, push to CI, wait for CI build, change another line” cycle just because some compiler really doesn’t like an important C++ feature!</p>
<p>Anyways, the usual compatibility problems can be solved with macros.
The implementations even define certain macros once they’ve implemented a feature,
making checking trivial:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if __cpp_noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond) noexcept(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) noexcept(Expr)
</span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) false
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>

<span>void</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>NOEXCEPT</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This allows a portable usage of features even though not all compilers have them already.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it-4">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>We can’t do that in any other way.
Workaround missing features requires some kind of preprocessing tool to get rid of not-supported features.
We have to use macros here.</p>
<h2 id="boilerplate-macros">Boilerplate macros</h2>
<p>C++’s templates and TMP go a long way to eliminate a lot of boilerplate code you otherwise need to write.
But sometimes, you just need to write a lot of code that is the same but not <em>quite</em> the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>less</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>greater</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Macros can generate that boilerplate for you:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define MAKE_COMP(Name, Op) \
</span><span>struct Name \
</span><span>{ \
</span><span>    bool operator()(const foo&amp; a, const foo&amp; b) \
</span><span>    { \
</span><span>        return a.bar Op b.bar; \
</span><span>    } \
</span><span>};
</span><span></span>
<span>MAKE_COMP</span><span>(</span><span>less</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>)</span>
<span>M…</span></code></pre></div></article></div></div>

<p>This blog has been online for about 10 hours. To put it more harshly: I’m a
nobody on the internet. Yet, when I generated my first visitor report with
<a href="https://goaccess.io/">goaccess</a>, I saw that the bot army has already started
attacking my server. A lot of suspicious-looking URLs have been requested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/config/getuser?index=0</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
  <li><code>/api/jsonws/invoke</code></li>
  <li><code>/solr/admin/info/system?wt=json</code></li>
  <li><code>/index.php?s=/Index/\x5Cthink\x5Capp/invokefunction</code>
<code>&amp;function=call_user_func_array&amp;vars[0]=md5&amp;vars[1][]=HelloThinkPHP21</code></li>
  <li><code>/console/</code></li>
  <li><code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/readme.txt</code></li>
  <li><code>/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a small sample but it is obvious that they are trying to exploit
known vulnerabilities. These are absolutely harmless because this is a static
website but there was one request that caught my attention:</p>



<p>My static site doesn’t have a <code>.env</code> file but I work on a lot of projects that
have one. I of course know that exposing the <code>.env</code> file is a mistake – it
usually contains passwords, keys and other sensitive information and in a
production environment, these should be in environment variables – but it is
very scary to see that this is <em>among the first things</em> hackers try – because
it’s so easy to accidentally copy it into a public directory.</p>

<p>So please, everyone: <strong>protect your <code>.env</code>!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@aidandcunniffe?source=post_page-----4101612d4ad9--------------------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Aidan Cunniffe" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*26JtOGzXJBiOCbDzaKjrWg.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="cb76"><em>and why I’m still trying…</em></p><p id="5880">One of the curious things about being human is the ability to hold two contradictory views simultaneously. When I’m in analysis mode I try to understand what market, technical and social forces have lead to the status quo. To do this effectively, or at least to induce useful principles for later use, you have to believe that things are the way they are for good reasons. As soon as I put my innovator hat on however, I get all jazzed up and think “screw that! X would be so much better if Y”. I’ve learned over the last year that balancing these two perspectives is essential to an inventor.</p><p id="9c7d">This week I watched Bret Victor’s <a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/" rel="noopener">Future of Programming</a> lecture from July 2013 and it compelled me to put these thoughts down on paper. During the lecture, Bret uses an overhead projector and pretends its 1973. He proudly presents the latest in programming research for the time and explains why it’d be really silly if we aren’t using them in 40 years. To Victor’s credit he remains in character the whole time as he satirically paints the ideal world we’ll soon enter — one the audience knows doesn’t really exist.</p><p id="cbac">The future Bret showed off included direct manipulations of the output (result) instead of the code, programming via constraints/goals, spatial (visual) programming paradigms, and massively parallel programming approaches. Declarative programming, functional programming, microservice architectures and WYSIWYG editors check some of those boxes, but not nearly at the level of their potential. All that being said, there’s no argument against real progress having been made the last 40 years, just not the progress many expected.</p><p id="f16a">So now I’ll put on my analysis hat and work through why the art of programming is so hard to advance beyond its current levels.</p><p id="a3f1">Many blame the lack of advancements on developers. We built shinny thing X, but developers are too arrogant, stubborn, busy, dismissive or all of the above to adopt it. I’ve even heard people accuse developers of selfishly protecting their future job prospects by trying to stifle the adoption of new programming mediums. Heck, I’ve said this before…</p><p id="f628">^ This is just wrong. In my experience developers are very rational beings. Their job is to find the most efficient way of solving problems every single day and if you create a tool that provides that they’ll be all over it. They’ll even volunteer their time to help you build it for free. If you move forward accepting that developers are mostly rational actors and have good reasons for adopting something / not adopting something you can learn a lot to inform future design.</p><p id="33a0">So I did that. I actually sat down with people over the last 3 months and asked them why they failed to adopt a variety of tools. I overwhelmingly got rational explanations to why switching to something new was irrational.</p><h2 id="99cb">Better Hammer Tradeoff</h2><p id="8f1e">Imagine you’re building a log cabin by hand with a bad, but usable hammer. When you’re 90% of the way finished a magical genie comes and offers you a better hammer. Great! But there’s a tradeoff: If you take the new shinny hammer, you have to start the house from scratch…oh and he turns back humanity to the stone age. You can get your new hammer, but you’ll have to do without bandsaws, your pickup truck, and yes, nails.</p><p id="3e8b">What’s the rational choice? Hint, it involves the old hammer.</p><p id="7f24">That parable emerged from summarizing all the interviews I conducted and highlights the frustrations developers have had with many of the new ‘solve all your problems’ tools they’ve tried. For context these tools fit into two categories: new programming languages including some flow &amp; graph based paradigms and no-code visual builders.</p><p id="6a39">There are two areas of value to consider when choosing a programming paradigm: the developer experience of the [language, tooling, GUI] and the strength of the ecosystem (what common problems have been solved already). Many of the new paradigms, while often built on sound principles, miss out on the massive body of work that already exists is language X. How do you weight these two areas when picking your paradigm? 30–70? 90–10? 1–99? Most people I spoke with rated the ecosystem as 2–3x more important than DX.</p><p id="9ab3">Tool-builders usually only focus on DX and [assume, hope, pray] that a community comes along and builds an ecosystem. This still can happens, but it was much much more common in the 90s than it is today. There are network effects in programming and a beautiful virtuous cycle quickly emerges among the most used tools. When a user shares functionality openly it makes paradigm more capable, which attracts new users, who continue to improve that paradigm. Boom! Node module for everything.</p><p id="0b6c">When you look at the languages that have really caught on recently, they tend to share one thing in common: they tap into an existing body of work. Look at TypeScript, the most popular language released after 2000, which interoperates with Javascript. Then there’s Swift, the second most popular language released after 2000. Just imagine where Swift would be today if it hadn’t been interoperable with Objective-C and the Cocoa legacy or if TypeScript’s ecosystem was a blue ocean from day one.</p><p id="272c">There are consequences for tool makers building an entirely new base abstraction, be it visual, text based or otherwise. If you choose not to interoperate with an existing ecosystem, you or your community will need to spend years coming up from the stone age to modernity. Programming is just learning to use a bunch of stacked abstractions. Even if you have an objectively better base abstraction, one that would have clearly won out over everything else had it been introduced in 1992, people will have few incentives to adopt it if there’s no ecosystem.</p><h2 id="749d">Sunk Cost…Sensibility</h2><p id="5881">Most people complete the phrase “Sunk cost _____” with “fallacy”. The classic economics thought experiment usually involves a couple staying at a concert they hate just because they paid face value for the tickets. An enlightened economist would, as the story goes, leave as soon as they became unhappy with the concert and reclaim a few precious hours. But if you had to pay $50k, $50M or $5B to leave the concert early, you’d probably stay. When the switching costs are that high, there’s good reason to stay and the largest employers of programmers in the world have enormous switching costs. This keeps mainstream programmers anchored to the status quo.</p><p id="2c6d">This is another completely rational choice developers make when sticking to the paradigms they know. The combined costs of hiring new people, training, rewriting the code, and the opportunity cost of choosing these actions over improving your product almost always outweigh the benefits of making the change. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" rel="noopener">Joel has a classic article about code rewrites that expands on this more.</a></p><p id="ccc1">Young companies without much in the way of legacy or those with no other choice have the luxury of picking new paradigms, but few of these companies end up becoming incumbents. Those who do make it are the kingmakers. Both Facebook and Twitter were first built on technologies that were inadequate for their eventual scale (PHP and Ruby). Facebook became so attached to PHP that they enhanced the language to suit their needs with Hack and other tools. Similarly, Twitter switched over to Scala which one could argue is a key reason for Scala’s mainstream success.</p><h2 id="a2d4">Solving the Least Important Problems</h2><p id="513f">Tool makers must strike a balance between learnability and productivity. A visual programming environment like MIT’s <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> is incredibly learnable. I’ve seen 4-5 year old kids build games with it after just a few hours. The drag/drop interface and shape based constraints are really easy to learn and prevent Scratch from ever being in a broken state. This is great for kids and individuals trying to learn programming.</p><p id="bb8d">The same things that make Scratch easy to learn also make it an unproductive environment for more serious programmers. For a professional, programming with drag and drop is way slower than keying in code — that’s just a fact.</p><p id="cad2">These tradeoffs must be considered whenever building a new tool. If you build something super learnable that is not productive you’ll get a lot of praise, but little follow through. If you build something that’s too difficult to learn, but very productive you’ll turn a lot of people off. To reach mainstream programmers you need to make something that is both learnable and productive.</p><p id="5100">I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes. For instance, if a new visual logic builder prides itself on preventing all syntax errors, that’s really cool, but most developers have learned to do that automatically.</p><p id="742f">Truth is, every tool you have ever used is flawed and every new tool will also be flawed. Humans subconsciously come up with ways to cope with their tools so they can keep themselves focussed on the bigger conceptual issues. That isn’t going to change anytime soon. If professionals already have habits in place to cope with things that have been made easier/more learnable by new tooling, those new tools do not have much value to them. It’s like offering a 40 year old who’s been driving manual her whole life an automatic car — yeah that’s great, but it’s not needed and she certainly won’t pay a premium for it to be included.</p><h2 id="6e7a">Things Have Been Getting Better</h2><p id="10b2">No good analysis fails to include a few words from the Advocatus Diaboli.</p><p id="e04a">Things have been getting better. The growth has just been in the ecosystems and not the paradigms themselves. We’ve been building this amazing tower of abstraction since the early days of programming that provide really useful abstractions for things like:</p><ul><li id="fb86">Charging a credit card, which has gone from a 20 person team to processor.charge()</li><li id="b32b">Configuring a massive cluster of servers is done with a short text file instead of …</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Note: the ideas in this post have already been covered numerous times in the past. One article that has greatly influenced my perspective over the years is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinley's Choose Boring Technology</a>. Below I'll explore the topic from my own experience, and how I ended up using Kubernetes for a recent project.</p><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring is less surprising</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>Boring is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit the problem at hand better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Exploit vs explore</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware it can be overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it works well for me, and I have been running production workloads with it for several years already. Please do not just blindly follow my path. Use what you already know best.</p><p>Kubernetes allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable debugging issues with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. It has also been around several years, there's lots of documentation, and a huge helpful community who can help. It'd argue that there's more documentation available than for any home-grown deployment system, or even EC2/Lambda/DigitalOcean for that matter.</p><p>As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><h2>Let complexity come over time</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 6, 2020 | https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-06</span>
<p>Despite what I may have said in an earlier post, it's not <em>all</em> that nice to code directly in wat.
So I've started work on a compiler. A very thin compiler. The language should feel very similar to our, beloved, <code>wat</code>, but save us from
typing all those <code>i32.const, local.get</code>.
</p>
<p>Some points up front:
</p>
<ul><li>
the compiler targets <code>WAT</code> (not <code>WASM</code>). This means using <code>WABT::wat2wasm</code>.
</li><li>
not self hosting <span>come on people, I don't even have malloc to play with yet, let alone a buggy, poorly implemented, partial copy of common lisp.</span>
</li><li>
the compiler is written in common lisp (specifically, sbcl). <span>hereinafter CL</span>.
</li><li>
syntax checking is state-of-the-art and errors are output in a readable format (i.e. you will get a cryptic <code>sbcl</code> debug trace if you make the
slightest mistake).
</li><li>
why <strong>sugar</strong>? It was either that or <code>watson, watsup, watsamatta, watulookin</code>. <span>Also cos it's just syntactical sugar, get it?</span>
</li><li>
internet searches are to be done using <code>sugarlang</code> <span>or sugarland if you prefer</span>.
</li><li>
there is no manual; not even mul/div or all the relation operators (e.g. &lt;=) are written yet!
</li><li>
the compiler output is not a standalone executable but a <code>wasm</code> file. The <em>best</em> standalone wasm runtime I've found so far is <code>wasm-interp</code>.
Please don't say node.js. You can say <code>v8</code>, maybe.
</li></ul>
<blockquote><strong>node.js/npm</strong><br>That feeling when ...<br>People say <em>Minimalist System</em><br>Then say "just use npm install ..."<br></blockquote><h2> sugar example</h2>
<p>Here is the <code>malloc.wat</code> example from the previous blog post on webasm re-written in <code>sugar</code>.
It's quite a bit more concise and convenient than the original raw <code>wat</code> (see below).
</p>
<p>(previous post on <code>wat</code>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html">/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html</a>
)
</p>
<pre>; malloc.sugar - sugar example code
(memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
(import "console" "log" (func js_log (i i32)))
(global memend i32 #x1000)
(global sbrk (mut i32) 0)
; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
(defun (export "malloc") (len i32) :result i32
  (locals (i32 (newbrk (+ sbrk len)) (mem sbrk)))
  (if (&gt;= newbrk memend) (return 0))
  (set sbrk newbrk)
  mem)
; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
(defun (export dump_range) (start i32 len i32)
  (locals (i32 i (end (+ start len))))
  (for (i start end)
    (js_log (get.u8* i))))
</pre>
<p>And this is what you would have written if you were coding directly in <code>wat</code>.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1)))))
</pre>
<h2> using sugar</h2>
<p>Write a <code>your-source.sugar</code> source file in your favorite text editor. Then run <code>sugar</code> on it to produce <code>your-source.wat</code>
</p>
<p>This is how I use sugar (with a makefile for calling sugar, then wat2wasm):
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar.mk">/src/sugar.mk</a>
</p>
<pre>$ mk malloc.wasm
./sugar malloc.sugar &gt;malloc.wat
summary: globals:2 functions:3 macros:2
wat2wasm malloc.wat
</pre>
<p>(see below for installing common lisp)
</p>
<h2> compiler</h2>
<p>The compiler is very small and may be interesting to read, for that reason.
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</p>
<p>It includes a macro system, which I have used to implement <code>inc</code> and <code>for</code> but it's not yet available for use from sugar
itself. <span>Also the full CL defmacro/destructuring-bind lambda list syntax is non trivial to replicate; not to mention backquote.</span>
</p>
<h3> compiler structure</h3>
<p>Here is the overall compiler structure
</p>
<pre>loop:
  read a form [from source file]
  (compile form) =&gt; stdout
compile form:
  integer =&gt; (i32.const int)
  symbol =&gt; (local/global.get varname) [check in environment/scope]
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    if (is-macro? form)
      (compile (expand-macro form))
    else:
      is-special? form =&gt; (compile-special form) [defun/import/export/global/set...]
      is-function? =&gt;
        for all args (compile arg)
        call func with args
      otherwise =&gt; error undefined function
</pre>
<h3> common lisp?</h3>
<p>Too many brackets?
</p><blockquote>Rule 1: There are no brackets, only indentation.<br>Rule 0: We suffer the brackets cos it gives us defmacro and that's worth a lot of suffering.<br></blockquote><p>Did you ever generate code? Did you think that was cool? You'll love common lisp. Try it for 2 weeks.
Money back guarantee if not satisfied.
</p>
<h3> value-if</h3>
<p>Lisp has value-IF i.e. you can use IF anywhere you use a value. That's like C's ternary but more powerful.
At first I thought WAT doesn't have it, but (if) has an optional
<code>(result type)</code> clause, like (func) so that it's branches
can return (type matched) values. So you can do clever things like this:
<span>note the (result i32) clause between if and condition.</span></p>
<pre>(set x
  (if (result i32) (&gt;= z limit)
    (comp-true-value y)
    (comp-false-value s 14 q)))
</pre>
<p><code>wat (select)</code> is like the C ternary operator although it can have blocks/statement sequences inside.</p><p>select v if: select has all 3 clauses always evaluated while (if) has only the conditional and the chosen branch evaluated. The other
(if) branch is not evaluated.
</p>
<h2> future directions</h2>
<h3> user accessible macros (defmacro)</h3>
<p>Implement (defmacro ...) for sugar.
</p>
<h3> shortcut and/or</h3>
<p>At the moment I only have the bitwise and/or operators '&amp;' and 'bor' and next on the list is having shortcutting logical <code>and/or</code> operators
like CL.
</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to have lisp-style <code>and/or</code> where the expression value is
returned rather than just 0 or 1. Also standalone <code>and/or</code> so we can have things like
</p>
<pre>(and (file-existsp fname) (process-file fname))
(or (setup-completep) (error setup-failed))
</pre>
<span>Shortcut <code>and/or</code> actually compile to nested (if) expressions.</span><h3> missing operators/functions</h3>
<p>A whole slew of function counterparts for other types (i64,f32,f64) are missing. The compiler cannot type-infer which one (see below)
so these would have explicit names like <code>+f64, set.f64</code> etc.
</p>
<p>There are many other relops missing etc. They are fairly trivial to add.
</p>
<h3> arrays</h3>
<p>Currently I'm using pointer <code>get*/set*</code> but I'd like to have <code>aref</code> and implicit index to pointer arithmetic.
</p>
<h3> loops</h3>
<p>Some more loops. <code>while repeat</code> etc. The underlying <code>block, loop, br_if, br</code> are exposed so writing loops is possible.
It would only be the case of adding some more macros to enable:
</p>
<pre>(while condition body...)
(forever body...)
</pre>
<p>Also <code>continue, break</code> would be nice.
</p>
<h3> structures / defstruct</h3>
<p>Some kind of struct might be nice to have. Even if all the fields had to be i32 initially i.e. just a vector with named,
instead of numbered, fields.
</p>
<h3> better syntax/semantic checking</h3>
<p>Even the current error messages drop you into the SBCL debugger, which can be a scary place - [<code>ctrl-d</code>] to exit.
</p>
<h3> type tracing</h3>
<p>Knowing the types of values would allow the compiler to check signatures of calls of user functions and builtins.
It would also allow me to infer the correct type for <code>set</code> rather than requiring <code>set.f32</code> etc.
</p>
<h3> LET</h3>
<p>Locals <em>must</em> be defined at the start of a function. This means implementing LET (scoped blocks with local variables) is not trivial.
The current, single-pass, compiler would need to become far more complex to first decide how many locals are required in a function,
then allocate them up-front and possibly rename them if there are clashes.
</p>
<h3> self hosting</h3>
<p>The <em>holy grail</em> of compiler writers is that they rewrite their compiler in their new language. Common Lisp is <em>so far</em> above
the level of <code>wat</code> that this would be a large undertaking. First I'd need to write malloc...
</p>
<h2> installing common lisp</h2>
<p>Setting up sugar/common lisp may be trivial or hard depending on how familiar with common lisp you are :)
</p>
<p>Installing common lisp (I use SBCL) is outside the scope of this post. (Tell me it's harder than npm ...)
</p>
<p>I refer you to [Zach Beane's]
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/</a>
</p>
<p>SBCL might even be in your package manager:
</p>
<pre>$ pacman -Ss sbcl
</pre>
<p><code>sugar</code> is run as a unix script. I've made a custom sbcl core since I prefer <code>iterate</code> over <code>loop</code>.
Here is a very brief explanation of how to make such a core, starting with <em>plain, vanilla</em> sbcl.
</p>
<pre>$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload '#:iterate)
* (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-iterate")
$ sudo mv sbcl-iterate /usr/share/sbcl/sbcl-iterate
</pre>
<h2> source</h2>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/malloc.sugar">/src/malloc.sugar</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</li></ul>
<h2> mistakes</h2>
<p>[2020-12-07] My original compiler structure had a macro expansion bug. I was misled since I was in a block where I had just checked that
(form) was a consp/list and I assumed this remained true inside that block.
However, I missed the fact that I am modifying the form inside the block, with (expand-macro).
It's possible (expand-macro) returns a non-list e.g. a symbol. Then my list assumptions break.
</p>
<pre>compile form:
  ...
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    while: (is-macro? form)
      form := (expand-macro form) &lt;---- bug: this can change form into a non-list
    is-special? form =&gt; ...
    is-function? =&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>First I fixed this with an extra list check in is-macro and also in the is-special/is-function parts, and a recursive call to compile
for non-list forms.
</p>
<p>I later thought if I had used a functional approach and avoided the mutation, I would not have made this mistake. My visual hint
that I was dealing with a list would have remained true. It turns out the functional solution is even more elegant than the original
and doesn't have the bug (+1 to functional purists).
</p>
<p>The functional solution, doesn't loop, it recurses on compile. Then compile gets the chance to decide again
what type of form expand-macro returned (nested macros …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system and does not require a central server. Although repositories are usually published at a well-known location for convenient cloning and fetching of the latest changes, this is actually not necessary. Each clone can have the full commit history and evolve independently. Furthermore, code changes can be exchanged via email or other means. Finally, even the clone itself does not need to be made from a well-known domain that hosts a git repository (see <tt>git-bundle(1)</tt>).</p>

<p>Given that git itself is already fully decentralized one would think there is no further work to do. I came across the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> project and its somewhat psychedelic website. Besides having a website with a wild color scheme, the project aims to offer a social coding experiment or git forge functionality using a peer-to-peer network architecture. According to the <a href="https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle">documentation</a> the motivation seems to be that git's built-in functionality works but is not user-friendly enough to make it accessible. In particular, it lacks social coding features.</p>

<p>The goal is to add git forge features like project and developer discovery, issue trackers, wikis, etc. Additional, distinctly decentralized functionality, is also touched on involving Ethereum as a way to anchor project metadata, pay contributors, etc. Radicle is still in early development so these features are not yet implemented. Here is my take on the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">How it Works</a> documentation, which is a little confusing due to its early stage and some incomplete sentences or typos. I don't know whether my understanding actually corresponds to the Radicle implementation that exists today or its eventual vision, because I haven't studied the code or tried running the software. However, the ideas that the documentation has brought up are interesting and fruitful in their own right, so I wanted to share them and explain them in my own words in case you also find them worth exploring.</p>

<h2>The git data model</h2>
<p>Let's quickly review the git data model because it is important for understanding peer-to-peer git forges. A git repository contains a <tt>refs/</tt> subdirectory that provides a namespace for local branch heads (<tt>refs/heads/</tt>), local and remotely fetched tags (<tt>refs/tags/</tt>), and remotely fetched branches (<tt>refs/remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/</tt>). Actually this namespace layout is just a convention for everyday git usage and it's possible to use the <tt>refs/</tt> namespace differently as we will see. The git client fetches refs from a remote according to a <i>refspec</i> rule that maps remote refs to local refs. This gives the client the power to fetch only certain refs from the server. The client can also put them in a different location in its local <tt>refs/</tt> directory than the server. For details, see the <tt>git-fetch(1)</tt> man page.</p>

<p>Refs files contain the commit hash of an <i>object</i> stored in the repository's object database. An object can be a commit, tree (directory), tag, or a blob (file). Branch refs point to the latest commit object. A commit object refers to a tree object that may refer to further tree objects for sub-directories and finally the blob objects that make up the files being stored. Note that a git repository supports <i>disjoint</i> branches that share no history. Perhaps the most well-known example of disjoint branches are the GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages features where these git forges publish static websites from the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/image files on a specific branch in the repository. That branch shares no version history with other branches and the directories/files typically have no similarity to the repository's main branch.</p>

<p>Now we have covered enough git specifics to talk about peer-to-peer git forges. If you want to learn more about how git objects are actually stored, check out my article on the <a href="http://blog.vmsplice.net/2016/05/git-internals-of-how-objects-are-stored.html">repository layout and pack files</a>.</p>

<h2>Identity and authority</h2>
<p>Normally a git repository has one or more owners who are allowed to push refs. No one else has permission to modify the refs namespace. What if we tried to share a single refs namespace with the whole world and everyone could push? There would be chaos due to naming conflicts and malicious users would delete or change other users' refs. So it seems like an unworkable idea unless there is some way to enforce structure on the global refs namespace.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer systems have solutions to these problems. First, a unique identity can be created by picking a random number with a sufficient number of bits so that the chance of collision is improbable. That unique identity can be used as a prefix in the global ref namespace to avoid accidental collisions. Second, there needs to be a way to prevent unauthorized users from modifying the part of the global namespace that is owned by other users.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a> provides the primitive for achieving both these things. A public key or its hash can serve as the unique identifier that provides identity and prevents accidental collisions. Ownership can be enforced by verifying that changes to the global namespace are signed with the private key corresponding to the unique identity.</p>

<p>For example, we fetch the following refs from a peer:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
</pre>

<p>This is a simplified example based on the Radicle documentation. Here <tt>identity</tt> is the unique identity based on a public key. Remember no one else in the world has the same identity because the chance of generating the same public key is improbable. The <tt>heads/</tt> refs are normal git refs to commit objects - these are published branches. The <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref points to an git object that contains a list of commit hashes and a signature generated using the public key. The signature can be verified using the public key.</p>

<p>Next we need to <i>verify</i> these changes to check that they were created with the private key that is only known to the identity's owner. First, we check the signature on the object pointed to by the <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref. If the signature is not valid we reject these changes and do not store them in our local repository. Next, we look up each ref in <tt>heads/</tt> against the list in <tt>signed_refs</tt>. If a ref is missing from the list then we reject these refs and do not allow them into our local repository.</p>

<p>This scheme lends itself to peer-to-peer systems because the refs can be propagated (copied) between peers and verified at each step. The identity owner does not need to be present at each copy step since their cryptographic signature is all we need to be certain that they authorized these refs. So I can receive refs originally created by identity A from peer B and still be sure that peer B did not modify them since identity A's signature is intact.</p>

<p>Now we have a global refs namespace that is partitioned so that each identity is able to publish refs and peers can verify that these changes are authorized.</p>

<h2>Gossip</h2>
<p>It may not be clear yet that it's not necessary to clone the entire global namespace. In fact, it's possible that no single peer will ever have a full copy of the entire global namespace! That's because this is a distributed system. Peers only fetch refs that they care about from their peers. Peers fetch from each other and this forms a network. The network does not need to be fully connected and it's possible to have multiple clusters of peers running without full global connectivity.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the global namespace there are <i>seed</i> repositories. Seeds are a common concept in peer-to-peer systems. They provide an entry point for new peers to learn about and start participating with other peers. In BitTorrent this is called a "tracker" rather than a "seed".</p>

<p>According to the Radicle documentation it is possible to directly fetch from peers. This probably means a <tt>git-daemon(1)</tt> or <tt>git-http-backend(1)</tt> needs to be accessible on the public internet. Many peers will not have sufficient network connectivity due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> limitations. I guess Radicle does not expect every user to participate as a repository.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a <i>gossip</i> system for propagating refs through the network. Let's revisit the refs for an identity in the global namespace:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
  remotes/
    &lt;another-identity&gt;/
      heads/
        main
        foo
      metadata/
        signed_refs
      remotes/
        ...
</pre>

<p>We can publish identities that we track in <tt>remotes/</tt>. It's a recursive refs layout. This is how someone tracking our refs can find out about related identities and their refs.</p>

<p>Thanks to git's data model the commit, tree, and blob objects can be shared even though we duplicate refs published by another identity. Since git is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable</a> object database the data is stored once even though multiple refs point to it.</p>

<p>Now we not only have a global namespace where anyone can publish git refs, but also ways to build a peer-to-peer network and propagate data throughout the network. It's important to note that data is only propagated if peers are interested in fetching it. Peers are not forced to store data that they are not interested in.</p>

<h2>How data is stored locally</h2>
<p>Let's bring the pieces together and show how the system stores data. The peer creates a local git repository called the <i>monorepo</i> for the purpose of storing portions of the global namespace. It fetches refs from seeds or direct peers to get started. Thanks to the <tt>remotes/</tt> refs it also learns about other refs on the network that it did not request directly.</p>

<p>This git repository is just a data store, it is not usable for normal git workflows. The conventional <tt>git branch</tt> and <tt>git tag</tt> commands would not work well with the global namespace layout and verification requirements. Instead we can clone a local file:/// repository from the monorepo that fetches a subset of the refs into the conventional git refs layout. The files can be shared because <tt>git-clone(1)</tt> supports hard links to local repositories. Thanks to <tt>githooks(5)</tt> and/or extensible <tt>git-push(1)</tt> remote helper support it's possible to generate the necessary global namespace …</p></div></div>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517400508447-f8dd518b86db?w=1226&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=edges" alt=""><div><section><p>We wrote about <a href="https://security.christmas/2019/21">"Safe travels for the road warrior"</a> last year. This year we offer one more trick, and expand our list for staying safe and secure on the road.</p>
<p>Watch out for shoulder surfers, and protect your equipment if you have to leave it in for example your hotel room.</p>
</section><article><section><p><em>PANDEMIC WARNING: Stay at home if you can. A virus has for the better part of 2020 attacked physical infrastructure (people). We have no patch or hotfix, so while that is being worked out, we advice you to travel as little as possible.</em> </p>
<h2>Shoulder surfers:</h2>
<p>Be aware of your surroundings and reduce the risk of shoulder surfers. A shoulder surfer is someone who is peaking over your shoulder to get information. We can spot people prone to this type of social engineering attack all the time. When people are visiting a cafee, are on public transport, or on air planes they will use their laptop for work stuff. And they don’t notice, or care if someone is looking.</p>
<p>To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost next to nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/privacy-screen-protector-angle-2.jpg" alt="privacy screen protector"></p>
<p>Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, but there are Windows and *Nix options as well. The point of this application is that it hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QsbNjHu.png" alt="a neat menu bar"></p>
<p>rather than this abomination of a menu bar: </p>
<p><img src="https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1password1280.jpg" alt="an untidy and talkative menue bar"></p>
<p>The reason for hiding this information from shoulder surfers is that it reveals many of your attack vector. If someone knows what applications you are running, they know a lot about you. Developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? You presumably work in IT. Bluetooth enabled, an old version of Outlook and a TorrentClient? The bad guys already have tools for these applications.  </p>
<h2>Mikado security</h2>
<p>The other tip is to not leave your computer laying around. This may seem obvious, but there are times when this is impossible. There will be events where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and must step away for a period of time. For instance in a hotel room while you are away for an hour, or go to a resturant.</p>
<p>If an adversary has physical access to your device, they can do all sort of damage. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/12/11/poker_pros_call_shenanigans_over_hotel_malware_infections/">A poker player had this happen to him</a>, where someone broke into his hotel room to install malware on his laptop. This is only one of the cases, but we suspect there are many more based on  the fact that hotel room locks are <a href="https://youtu.be/-Bazy3Ew6D4">ridiculously insecure</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX-O4XuCW1Y">easy to bypass</a>.<br>
So to combat this problem, we have devised a nice little trick to help you stay safe if you have to leave your device behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5475/9350249910_6aeb4b5d85_h.jpg">
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/ffftxm">Mikado</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kobakpontorg/">Balazs Koren</a>, on Flickr</p>
<p>Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) is a game where players drop a bundle of sticks as a loose bunch onto a table top. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others.</p>
<p>MikadoSecurity is where you spread the sticks over the object that you want to protect. You then take a picture of it, and when you return, you can verify that no one has tampered with your device.
In the event that the sticks are not as you left them, you can escalate the problem. Either to do forensics, or discard the computer if you need to.</p>
<p>This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify.
An example of this is a sudoku board. It is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but if I hand you a board, it is easy for you to verify if I did it correct. </p>

A big source of angst was the amount of “unknown traffic”, things which matched no patterns. Our sales team wanted this less. Our customers wanted it less. Our competitors had less. Why couldn’t we?</p><p>I used to answer this question as follows. “You know, I can put in one bad pattern, that mis-matches, a false positive. The amount of unknown will go down. Will that make it better? I can make 0% unknown right now.”. Interestingly, some would agree with the statement “sure, lets do that”. Some would say “don’t be ridiculous, I want 100% known, and 0% incorrect.”. I would answer the last question as “what if you made your own proprietary protocol, the license-plate protocol. You, and only you use it. The data in the stream is ciphered from your license plate. Would you expect a pattern for that?”. They would usually say no, I would then point out that 0% unknown as a false goal, the real goal was 0% incorrectly known and as much known as feasible. Still didn’t stop the competitor from using weak false positives to get to higher <code>known</code> amount.</p><p>Yesterday I received an email from the good people at Google. They are launching a new document leakage tool. It scans your shared documents for sensitive things (emails, medical, that sort of thing). Mine is below. Its alarming. 7% of my shared files contain sensitive information! O no!</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" src="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png 1024w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x468.png 768w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-100x61.png 100w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-150x91.png 150w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-200x122.png 200w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-450x274.png 450w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-600x366.png 600w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-900x549.png 900w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-src="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png" data-lazy-srcset="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png 1024w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x468.png 768w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-100x61.png 100w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-150x91.png 150w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-200x122.png 200w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-450x274.png 450w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-600x366.png 600w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-900x549.png 900w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1158w"></figure></div><p>But then I started reading… Its the same pattern match technology.

<p>Corrections added to the Creator/Type code section thanks to user "Somebody" on Hacker News</p>

<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

<span>DESCRIPTION</span>              
     <span>VisiData</span> is an easy-to-use multipurpose tool to explore, clean, edit, and restructure          
     data. Rows can be selected, filtered, and grouped; columns can be rearranged, trans-           
     formed, and derived via regex or Python expressions; and workflows can be saved, doc-          
     umented, and replayed.

<p>I used <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> for years in Russia, Germany, and the United States. All the time, the experience was great. At some point, I read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9JywH">book about Airbnb</a> to understand the company better.</p>

<p>For Thanksgiving week (November 21-29), five of my friends and I rented a house in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total price for nine days: <strong>$2543</strong>.</p>

<p>Previously people went to Vegas to spend time in casinos or walk on The Strip. This year, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">the pandemic</a> made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was not a problem for us. We did not plan to socialize; we were going rock climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rock">Red Rocks</a>, located next to Vegas, is an excellent place for traditional, sport, bouldering, multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<p>The plan was for some people to take days off and climb every day, and for others to work three days remotely and join the gang during the rest.</p>

<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>

<p>We moved in on Saturday night. The next morning, excited, we woke up at 6am, had breakfast, verified that we closed back and front doors and at 7am drove to the Red Rocks Park.</p>

<p>We had a fantastic day of climbing, but after the sunset, we went home to realize that the window in one of the rooms was open and some of our belongings had disappeared.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three work Macbook Pro (I do not include the price, they are replaced by our employees for free)</li>
  <li>One personal <a href="https://amzn.to/33uWB3F">Macbook Pro</a> ($1550)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JCZWqE">Oculus Quest 2</a>. I just bought it. Really cool. Wanted to share the experience. ($399)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnyrUt">GoPro Hero 6</a> ($194)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/36oMMGz">Lenovo Tab 4, 10.1in Android Tablet</a> ($190)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3lms9is">Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones</a> ($348)</li>

</ul>

<p>I called the host, told her about the situation. She shared a set of images from the cameras and the next day sent the whole video.</p>

  </p>

<p>We believe this is what happened:</p>

<p>At 8:55am, two hours after we left, someone</p>
<ol>
  <li>Openly came to the front door.</li>
  <li>Knocked in the door.</li>
  <li>Waved Lexus car keys at the camera. (We do not have Lexus.)</li>
  <li>Ringed the bell.</li>
  <li>Waited to verify that no one was at home.</li>
  <li>Got to the back of the house.</li>
  <li>Put gloves and balaclava on.</li>
  <li>Checked if the back door was open. It was not.</li>
  <li>Checked if he can open the window. And it was possible.
10 Moved the pool chair below the window.</li>
  <li>Got into the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>We called the police, and in two hours an officer came. He was polite and professional. He got the list of the stolen items, our version of the incident in the written form, and left.</p>

<p>I was curious, how did the burglar open the window? I checked, and the answer was simple: <strong>the lock on the window was not operational.</strong> No need to break anything, anyone can open the window from the outside!</p>

<p>If the weather was warmer, we would probably try to open windows the night we came. In that case we would discover the problem, but the night was cold and we did not touch the windows.</p>

<p>Till this moment, I was chill. Bad things happen. Burglars get into houses, and no one could be protected from it. We were safe in this incident, and from the money perspective, our loss was not huge.</p>

<p>But the fact that the lock on that window was not functioning is an issue (few more windows had the same problem). If the front door lock was broken it would be worse but even windows that could not be locked are sketchy.</p>

<p>In general, I prefer to blame myself for bad things that happen to me. This time I cannot figure out what was my fault. For sure, we could check all the locks in the house, but it is an overkill.</p>

<p>I am ok with making mistakes and paying for them. But this time, we paid for the host’s errors and Airbnb’s as a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: the house was not ready for hosting the guests.</li>
  <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: limitations of the onboarding policy. I believe there is a list of things that the house owner needs to mark to become a host, and either functioning window locks are not on the list, or it is not enforced.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we told the host about our discovery, she sent a person to lock all the windows completely. From now on, no one would be able to open them from inside or outside.</p>



<p>I wanted to reach out to Airbnb, tell them about the situation, and ask about the next steps.</p>

<p>Safety comes first. Hence I assumed that even if you are under stress and your brain is not functioning well, it is obvious how to contact the support team.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it is not the case.</p>

<p>I spent some time on the Airbnb website but could not figure out which phone number I should call.</p>

<p><strong>Message to AirBnb</strong>: It would be great if you simplify the design of the support page. When we talk about safety, it should be about efficiency and not about the visual appeal or cuteness level.</p>

<p>I would like it to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I open the Airbnb website =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the support page.</li>
  <li>I open the support page =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the hotline phone number.</li>
</ul>

<p>I posted the tweet about the incident and tagged Airbnb and Las Vegas police in it.</p>

<blockquote>— Vladimir Iglovikov (@viglovikov) <a href="https://twitter.com/viglovikov/status/1330741490759266304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>A miracle happened. Airbnb contacted me and asked for my email to identify the account and to get more details.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Marketing team at Airbnb has alarms that trigger when someone mentions the company on social media.</p>

<p>Finally, after two hours, we got into the conversation about the incident, but the path to get there was not obvious at all.</p>

<p>Imagine how many people got into trouble in similar situations and did not leverage this communication channel?</p>

<p>I got an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is XXX, from the Airbnb claims team.</p>

  <p>I am contacting you regarding the incident that occurred during your reservation with YYY.</p>

  <p>As my colleague informed you in the previous email, we are only able to offer up to $500 for any stolen property. In order to proceed with this refund, I will need the following:</p>

  <p>*Original purchase invoice for the stolen items.</p>

  <p>This is requested as “proof of ownership”, if you don’t have the original purchase invoice, a picture of you where the item can be seen will also be accepted as proof of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this story is not about money. But getting compensated for the host’s and Airbnb’s mistake with cash or AirBnB credits would be nice. It does not address the issue with window locks but sweetens the situation.</p>

<p>We interpreted the email as: “We will compensate up to $500 per stolen item”. Using the numbers from the invoices, it summed to $2600.</p>

<p>We collected invoices, sent them to Airbnb, and got the reply with words: “After additional review, I’m happy to report that we have just released a payout in the amount of $500 to your Airbnb account. You can confirm in your Airbnb Transaction History.”</p>

<p>The guess about up to $500 per item was overly optimistic.</p>

<p>After the end of the stay, I got a message from the host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for choosing our home for your vacation stay.</p>

  <p>I hope the home met (and even surpassed) your expectations. It was a sincere pleasure hosting you, and I really hope to host you again in the near future. I would be truly grateful for a 5 star review of your stay when you have a spare moment and I would definitely do the same for you.</p>

  <p>Also, please in the private comments if there is something, the home or myself can approve of please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is a standard template, but under the circumstances, it sounds strange and
does not fit the story and overall experience.</p>

<p>I did not plan to share the actual address of the property. The harm to the renting business could be material. But after this text, I changed my mind. It does not look like the host plans to revise the house and look for things that can and should be fixed. For example, the front door lock is barely working. The door could be open with a good push.</p>



<p>We had a great vacation. The weather was good, and the red rocks are remarkable. We had a lot of fun and plan to come back sometime soon.</p>

<p>Work laptops were replaced. We accepted the loss of personal items.</p>

<p>The Airbnb experience was not as smooth as we expected. Our things got stolen, and even on the other days, we did not feel comfortable leaving belongings in the house.</p>

<p>The host was responsive, but it is not enough. Communicating with guests and collecting money should not be the only responsibility. It is worth inspecting the house and fixing things that do not work as expected proactively, without waiting till the universe gives you feedback.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that staying at AirBnB is safe, and such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but, for sure, Airbnb has some work to do to improve communication and increase the guests’ safety. The compensation of $500 for all the stolen items does not look fair either.</p>

<p>I would like to end the story with some action items like: “<strong>Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX</strong>.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.</p>

<p>When I sit in front of the computer in San Francisco, the only thing that comes to my mind is to build a Face Recognition system and check the burglar’s face in it. Something similar to Clearview. Machine Learning is my expertise; creating such a system is straightforward but will take some time. Tempting. Thinking about it.</p>

<p>What would be your action item after such an experience?</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robust and safe autonomous navigation, particularly so in off-road environments. Recent deep learning advances for 3D semantic segmentation rely heavily on large sets of training data; however, existing autonomy datasets represent urban environments or lack multimodal off-road data. We fill this gap with RELLIS-3D, a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment containing annotations for <strong>13,556 LiDAR scans</strong> and <strong>6,235 images</strong>. The data was collected on the Rellis Campus of Texas A\&amp;M University and presents challenges to existing algorithms related to class imbalance and environmental topography. Additionally, we evaluate the current state of the art deep learning semantic segmentation models on this dataset. Experimental results show that RELLIS-3D presents challenges for algorithms designed for segmentation in urban environments. Except for the annotated data, the dataset also provides full-stack sensor data in ROS bag format, including <strong>RGB camera images</strong>, <strong>LiDAR point clouds</strong>, <strong>a pair of stereo images</strong>, <strong>high-precision GPS measurement</strong>, and <strong>IMU data</strong>. This novel dataset provides the resources needed by researchers to develop more advanced algorithms and investigate new research directions to enhance autonomous navigation in off-road environments.</p>

<p>With the goal of providing multi-modal data to enhance autonomous off-road navigation, we defined an ontology of object and terrain classes, which largely derives from <a href="http://rugd.vision/">the RUGD dataset</a> but also includes unique terrain and object classes not present in RUGD. Specifically, sequences from this dataset includes classes such as mud, man-made barriers, and rubble piles. Additionally, this dataset provides a finer-grained class structure for water sources, i.e., puddle and deep water, as these two classes present different traversability scenarios for most robotic platforms. Overall, 20 classes (including void class) are present in the data.</p>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Metaphors are everywhere;&nbsp;in literature, visual arts, poetry, and films. Language, in a way, itself&nbsp;is a metaphor. But try to make one on the fly, and you will find out it is not easy. Creating a metaphor requires ingenuity and care. A small mistake can make a metaphor clumsy. So how does one write a good metaphor?&nbsp;Let’s find out.</p><h2>Why Metaphors are Important</h2><p>Metaphors make us understand things better. When feelings are involved or when something happens which has no proper words in our vocabulary, we need something to communicate our experience. Metaphors come in handy in such situations. For example, author F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to describe good writing. He could simply say that good writing was hard or good writing is very difficult. But he chose to say it like this:</p><p><em>All good writing is swimming underwater and holding your breath.</em></p><p>The metaphor&nbsp;“swimming underwater while holding breath” opens a door for us into the experience of Fitzgerald as a writer. That was a very difficult thing to convey in plain words. A whole paragraph might have not sufficed. But here a metaphor has conveyed the meaning completely in a single sentence. Metaphors help us convey meaning by using similarities in different objects and experiences. They relate things with one another and the result is a new understanding of a certain thing. All good poetry and literature do this to create new meanings. Another example is this beautiful metaphor by Shakespeare:</p><blockquote><p>All the world's a stage,<br>And all the men and women merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances;<br>And one man in his time plays many parts.</p><p><em>As You Like It</em>, William Shakespeare</p></blockquote><p>Metaphors help us use all of our senses in reading a sentence. They make the experience of language more immersive. Take this sentence as an example:</p><blockquote><p>Time has not stood still. It has washed over me, washed me away as if I'm nothing more than a woman of sand, left by a careless child too near the water.</p><p><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, Margaret Atwood</p></blockquote><p>The writer could simply have said that time has changed me. But the use of sand and water as metaphors has given the whole experience a life of its own. We can hear in our minds the sound of waves when reading the sentence. We can imagine a woman of sand. Therefore, metaphors give a deeper meaning to our words. They can convey meanings for which sometimes whole pages are necessary and sometimes even a book is not enough.</p><blockquote><p>I'm a little pencil in the hand of a writing God.</p><p>Mother Teresa</p></blockquote><p>In this small sentence, Mother Teresa has conveyed the whole of her faith. We can get a glimpse of her intimate relationship with God. We can sense her metaphysical experience. This was not possible without the use of a metaphor.</p><p>Along with that, plain words can be boring for our minds. Our minds hate repetitiveness and mundaneness and loves newness and ingenuity. Metaphors give us this freshness and livens ordinary language. Language becomes more interesting.</p><blockquote><p>She herself is a haunted house. She does not possess herself; her ancestors sometimes come and peer out of the windows of her eyes and that is very frightening.</p><p><em>The Bloody Chamber, </em>Angela Carter</p></blockquote><p>Simply saying that there is an eerie feeling attached to her the writer could have told us about the character but using a metaphor makes it more interesting and memorable. In addition to that, Metaphors add vagueness and abstractedness to our language. This gives readers free rein to make their own interpretations.</p><blockquote><p><em>There's a bluebird in my heart that<br></em><em>wants</em><em> to get out<br></em><em>but</em><em> I'm too tough for him,<br></em><em>I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br></em><em>to</em><em> let anybody see<br></em><em>you</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>Bluebird</em>, Charles Bukowski</p></blockquote><p>Nobody has a clear idea of what the bluebird is in this poem and so people make their interpretations. Metaphors give us the freedom to read works in the context of our own Worldview.</p><h2>How to Write Good Metaphors?</h2><p>First of all, start thinking about the thing or experience you want to express. Concentrate on the idea and think about it deeply. Understand it thoroughly. How do you feel about the whole idea?</p><p>For example, you want to describe the scene of someone waking up for the first time to the sound of the coming train. Lean into the experience of someone peacefully sleeping in a cozy room under blankets in a comfy bed. Now imagine a train passing over with an ear-shattering sound. What will the character feel like? Imagine it. Now can you compare it to something else that is similar in its sudden experience?</p><p>For me, the scene of a car suddenly breaking through the bedroom wall is similar so I would construct my metaphor around that imagery.</p><p><em>He woke up and thought a car had crashed in his bedroom. Everything was moving. His heart was pumping. "Oh! It's the train!" he let out a sigh and shook his head.</em></p><p>Secondly, try using original metaphors in your writing or ones that are rare. Commonly used metaphors are dead in a sense. Some dead metaphors are given here as an example:</p><ul><li>It's raining cats and dogs.</li><li>I'm visiting an old flame.</li><li>He's loose cannon.</li><li>She found herself behind the eight balls.</li><li>He drives me up a wall.</li><li>She saw the light at the end of the tunnel.</li><li>Ticking time bomb</li><li>Tip of the iceberg</li><li>Slippery slope</li><li>Going the extra mile</li><li>Early bird</li><li>Icy personality</li><li>Turning in one's grave</li><li>About to explode (from anger)</li></ul><p>Here are some more complex examples of metaphors. Read them carefully so you can get an idea of how a metaphor works.</p><p><em>1. Books are the mirrors of the soul.</em></p><p>Virginia Woolf describes here the connection between an author and his/her books. Books describe the inner thoughts of the author's mind. That is an experience similar to seeing one's soul. A mirror reflects everything that is in front of it. It does not lie. This small sentence combines these two concepts perfectly to convey a beautiful meaning.</p><p>2. <em>"</em><em>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"</em></p><p>Shakespeare is trying to describe the feeling of love that Romeo had for Juliet. The sun is a classic metaphor used in ancient literature to describe a lover.</p><p>3. <em>The parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is </em><em>something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick </em><em>it away.</em></p><p>The author here depicts the anger Matilda's parents felt for their child using “a scab on skin”. A person puts up with it because it's painful and messy to remove it before time.</p><p>4. <em>"O Lord, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You, our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand."</em></p><p>In this verse of the Bible, the feeling of helplessness and the might of the All-Mighty God is described. Helplessness is compared with the inertness of the clay. And the potter's hands are the workings of God.</p><p>5. <em>Alas,</em><em> and yet what are you, my written and painted thoughts! It is not long ago that you were still so many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>, young, and malicious, so full of thorns and hidden spices you made me sneeze and laugh and now? You </em><em>have already taken off your novelty and some of you, I fear, are on the point of becoming truths: they already look so immortal, so pathetically righteous, so boring! And has it ever been otherwise? For what things do we write and paint, we mandarins with </em><em>Chinese brushes, we immortalizers of things which let themselves </em><em>be</em><em> written, what alone are we capable of painting? Alas, only that which is about to wither and is beginning to lose its fragrance! Alas, only storms departing exhausted and feelings grown old and yellow! Alas, only birds strayed and grown weary in flight </em><em>who</em><em> now let themselves be caught in the hand in our hand! We immortalize that which cannot live and fly much longer, weary and mellow things alone! And it is only your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have the </em><em>colours</em><em>, many </em><em>colours</em><em> perhaps, many many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>tendernesses</em><em> and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds: but no one will divine from these how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and wonders of my solitude, you my old beloved wicked thoughts!</em></p><p>Here Nietzsche is describing the thoughts in the human mind which are immortal, ever-changing with infinite possibilities, and how impossible it is to define them truly words.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Good metaphors spice up any piece of art, be it a painting or a poem or a novel. Some writers use whole characters as forms of metaphors, others use symbolism. Learning to write a good metaphor can be a difference between a good piece and a great piece.

<p>This question often pops up, when you need a random direction vector to place things in 3D or you want to do a particle simulation.</p>



<p>We recall that a 3D unit-sphere (and hence a direction) is parametrized only by two variables; elevation <span data-display="false">\theta \in [0; \pi]</span> and azimuth <span data-display="false">\varphi \in [0; 2\,\pi]</span> which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system#Coordinate_system_conversions">can be converted to Cartesian coordinates as</a></p>



<p><span data-display="false">\begin{aligned}  x &amp;= \sin\theta \, \cos\varphi \\  y &amp;= \sin\theta \, \sin\varphi \\  z &amp;= \cos\theta \end{aligned} </span></p><p>If one takes the easy way and uniformly samples this parametrization in numpy like</p>



<pre><code>phi = np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi
theta = np.random.rand() * np.pi</code></pre>



<p>One (i.e. you as you are reading this) ends with something like this:</p>

<p>While the 2D surface of polar coordinates uniformly sampled (left), we observe a bias of sampling density towards the poles when projecting to the Cartesian coordinates (right).<br>The issue is that the cos mapping of the elevation has an uneven step size in <em>Cartesian</em> space, as you can easily verify: <span data-display="false">cos^{'}(x) = sin(x)</span>.</p>



<p>The solution is to simply sample the elevation in the Cartesian space instead of the spherical space – i.e. sampling <span data-display="false">z \in [-1; 1]</span>. From that we can get back to our elevation as <span data-display="false">\theta = \arccos z</span>:</p>



<pre id="block-6ecb681a-6f13-49b9-8783-cebd81f25d08"><code>z = 1 - np.random.rand() * 2 # convert rand() range 0..1 to -1..1
theta = np.arccos(z)</code></pre>



<p>As desired, this compensates the spherical coordinates such that we end up with uniform sampling in the Cartesian space:</p>

<h2>Custom opening angle</h2>



<p>If you want to further restrict the opening angle instead of sampling the full sphere you can also easily extend the above. Here, you must re-map the cos values from <span data-display="false">[1; -1]</span> to <span data-display="false">[0; 2]</span> as</p>

<a id="intro1"></a></p><h2>2k20 - a potential crisis in 2020 </h2>
<p>Modern browsers in 2020 will expect to 
	"connect HTTPS" only using TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 (this assumes that support for 
	everything from SSLv3 to TLSv1.1 will be removed)</p>

<p>While browsers are constantly being updated because of their financial 
	use in everything from on-line purchases to on-line investing and banking, 
many web servers are not. What is worse it this: many organizations, including 
	governments large and small, are slow to update software</p>

<p><span>comment:</span> Firefox has been warning for several months 
(today is 2019-08-25) that one of my servers is preferentially offering 
connections via TLS-1.0 (the lock icon is closed but is orange). Chrome and IE11 
each present a green lock icon.</p>
<h3><a name="openvms"></a>The OpenVMS ecosystem</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Two companies are currently supporting OpenVMS (but this is about to 
	change)<ul>
		<li>In 2014, HP transferred the rights to develop/support OpenVMS to VSI 
		(<a href="https://www.vmssoftware.com/">VMS Software Inc</a>)</li>
		<li>In 2015, HP split into two companies: HP (most desktop products) and 
		HPE (enterprise)</li>
		<li>HPE continued to support OpenVMS software contracts sold to HP customers 
		before 2015 (they also sold/supported VSI products)</li>
		<li>Early in 2019, HPE removed most OpenVMS stuff (documentation as well 
		as software) from their website including CSWS-2.2-1 (<a href="http://neilrieck.net/docs/openvms_notes_apache.html">Compaq Secure Web Services</a>) 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.0.63</span><ul>
			<li>For example, this link:
			<a href="http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html">http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html</a> 
		previously provided both software-downloads and product documentation 
		but now diverts you to this common landing page:
			<a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us">https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us</a> 
		(in fact, all HPE OpenVMS software links now drop you here)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you have an OpenVMS support contract with HPE, then you will be 
		able to request the latest version of file MOD_SSL (an Apache module for 
		CSWS) which is based upon OpenSSL-1.0L but does not implement TLSv1.3<ul>
			<li>HPE has announced the end of all OpenVMS support by the end of 2020.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Businesses requiring <strong>CSWS/Apache on OpenVMS</strong> should immediately 
	move their support contracts over to VSI where you will have access to a new version of CSWS 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.4.12</span><ul>
			<li><span>caveat:</span> you may be required to update your OS to OpenVMS-8.4-2 so do not wait until the last minute</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For companies and/or hobbyists financially unable to move to VMS 
	Software Inc., your the only remaining option is to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD HTTPd 
	(the high quality web server from down-under) which is not based upon 
	Apache.<ul>
		<li>WASD already supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3</li>
		<li>"I think" support agreements may be available</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This web-page will document my efforts to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD 
	HTTPd on a sacrificial laboratory system (we employ a lot of CGI including one SOAP-based 
	feed)</li>

<h2><a name="intro2"></a>Introduction to WASD HTTPd</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/">WASD</a> HTTPd - is a very high quality free 
	web 
		server from <a href="http://www.vsm.com.au/">VSM Software

		<li>it can link to its own SSL libraries which already support TLS-1.3, or HP-SSL (based upon 
		OpenSSL-0.9 and lower), or HP-SSL1 (OpenSSL-1.0 and higher)</li>
		<li>excerpt from page-13 of the book <strong>OpenVMS with Apache, OSU, and WASD</strong>
		<p>
				The idea with WASD was to be a really good VMS-only server: Mark Daniel says, "I 
suffered a bit of a VMS cringe when amongst my UNIX colleagues (VMS was perceived 
to be a bit slow and cumbersome), so I have also endeavored to make WASD as fast 
and efficient as I could, avoiding C run-time library and even RMS code layers 
where it was feasible and worth it. I also wanted a similarly tight scripting 
environment and have spent a lot of time honing this aspect"</p>
		</li>
		<li><span>Trivia:</span> <strong>WASD</strong> = "Wide Area 
		Surveillance Division". WASD was previously known as <strong>HFRD</strong> 
		(High Frequency Radar Division) of Australia's Defense, Science and 
		Technology Organization</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<div>
	<p><strong><a id="executive"></a>Executive Summary</strong>:
	</p><ul>

		have worked on to date.<br>I am currently supporting web servers on these 
		production platforms...<table>

		WASD on the oldest hardware is able to out-perform Apache on the newest 
		hardware (caveat: I 
		haven't done any full-load stress tests just yet)</li>
		<li>WASD HTTPd is published with all the source code. This means that if 
		Adelaide gets hit with an asteroid you will be able to fix your 
		own code (provided you have access to the DECC "C compiler)</li>
		<li>The source code is mirrored in at least three other locations (see 
		asteroid comment)</li>

<h2><a id="firststeps"></a>First Steps</h2>
<ul>
	<li>download all the zip files you think you will need from here: <a href="https://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/">
	https://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/</a> (or the various mirror sites)<ul>
		<li><span>caveat:</span> do not skip any CUP (cumulative 
		update package) files. I wasted a 
		whole day trying to get both Server Admin and SYSUAF to work (I assumed 
		I was doing something wrong). I was only successful after I noticed, 
		then installed, the CUP file (probably need new 
		eyeglasses) </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>none of these files offer executables so you will need to download a 
	vanilla package (necessary to "compile-link" or just "link") as well as the 
	architecture-specific files</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="unzip"></a>Unzip then install</h2>
<p>Unzip</p>
<pre>$! DCL script to unzip WASD
$! this is an rx2660 (Itanium2)

                <h3 id="who-makes-up-the-fi-re-movement">Who makes up the FI/RE Movement?</h3><p>Despite its relatively recent popularity, the FI/RE movement is still in many ways ambiguous. Who are these millionaires next door and what common traits are shared among them? Fortunately based off of data obtained from a survey conducted of nearly 1,400 individuals in the r/financialindependence subreddit, we can get a bit more insight into not only those who are pursuing FI/RE, but also those who have already achieved it. Special thanks to u/melonbalon for conducting the survey in the first place!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 600w, https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="insights-obtained">Insights Obtained</h3><p>So much data was obtained as part of this survey and the figures reported in the above visual only scratch the surface of valuable insights that could be drawn. Of note however are a couple items:</p><ol><li><strong>Commute times are very low.</strong> Over 20% of respondents noted that it takes last than 10 minutes to get to work. Additionally, nearly 70% had a commute of less than 30 minutes. It's likely that these smaller commute times result in less transportation costs which could be a motivating factor.</li><li><strong>Individuals who have already FI/RE'd are highly educated.</strong> Not only did nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. Perhaps these individuals have more time for additional schooling post-retirement. It also could be the case that this additional education helped them FI/RE in the first place. Regardless, more schooling was expected in comparison to the respondent group that had not yet FI/RE'd simply given the older average age. </li><li><strong>Respondents favored urban and suburban environments equally. </strong>Additionally this ratio remained constant in both the pursuing FI/RE and FI/RE'd populations. I would have expected far more suburban living, but perhaps the increased cost of living in an urban environment is offset enough by the reduced transportation costs to be appealing.</li></ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE: While these are valid reasons, <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphones-are-inferior-to-android-phones-the-value/">scoring them suggests I should still switch to the iPhone</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I am on day 10 of using an iPhone. I came from the Android world.</p>



<p>The iPhone is deficient. I am leaning towards returning it.</p>




<h2><span id="Context"></span>Context<span></span></h2>



<p>Ten days ago, I switched from a Pixel 4 XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I went with this iPhone model because it’s similarly sized to the Pixel 4 XL, plus I value photography.</p>



<h3><span id="Why_I_switched"></span>Why I switched<span></span></h3>



<p>I made the switch due to intellectual curiosity, to overcome limitations of the Pixel 4 XL, and to get on board with the rest of my family.</p>



<p>I am questioning this decision. While the iPhone helps me escape two Pixel 4 XL limitations, iOS’s regressions from Android feel like a heavy burden.</p>



<p>I am inside Apple’s return window, so I can return the iPhone for a full refund. It is tempting.</p>



<h3><span id="Android_only_has_two_worthwhile_brands"></span>Android only has two worthwhile brands<span></span></h3>



<p>My analysis relies heavily on my experience with the Pixel 4 XL. Much of what I say about Android applies to to top-tier Android manufacturers. Among the requirements of top-tier manufacturers is they deliver highly vanilla Android. This includes <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel">Pixel </a>(Google’s in-house brand), <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus</a>, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung is not a top-tier phone manufacturer.</strong> Its hardware is decent, but it has bad software. Samsung replaces Android’s best features with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078945/">poor, fussy substitutes</a>. It also adds annoying, pointless bloat. In other words, just to differentiate its brand, it <em>devalues its brand </em>by trashing up its core software.</p>



<p>The Bixby assistant is the best example of Samsung’s stupidity. It’s awful. Samsung killing Bixby might signal that it’s ready to take Android seriously. Until then, Samsung is simply not a top-tier manufacturer.</p>



<p>The Samsung example is important because Apple is the same: <strong>great hardware, bad software</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="A_note_about_definitions"></span>A note about definitions<span></span></h2>



<p>The article’s language is sometimes imprecise. Truly, if you’re comparing Android to something in the Apple ecosystem, it would be iOS. But that is not how people talk about their phones, so I am using loose terminology in places.</p>



<p>If you’re a True Nerd™ and find my word use upsetting, just associate my word with its parent ecosystem.</p>



<p>This is how several terms are correctly used:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word category</strong></td><td><strong>Android phone ecosystem</strong></td><td><strong>Apple phone ecosystem</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers</td><td>Google, OnePlus, and more</td><td>Apple</td></tr><tr><td>Phone brand</td><td>Pixel (Google), OnePlus, and more</td><td>iPhone</td></tr><tr><td>Phone model (current generation)</td><td>For Pixel: Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 5. For OnePlus: OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8, OnePlus 7T. There are more current model from other manufacturers.</td><td>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE, and more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, some Android features I enjoy are Pixel-specific. While Google freely distributes Android to other manufactures, it reserves some newer features for its own Pixel phones. Sometimes I may mistakenly generalize a Pixel-specific feature as an Android feature. Since Pixel-specific features often eventually end up on other phones, associating Pixel with Android is probably correct in the long run.</p>



<h2><span id="Where_Android_is_better"></span>Where Android is better<span></span></h2>



<p>Android is well thought out. It has a great UX. I really miss its great design.</p>



<h3><span id="Call_screening_Android_wins"></span>Call screening: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">built-in call screener</a> is excellent. It blocks calls it is confident are garbage. If the caller is in a gray area, it will ask the caller first to state the reason for calling, then show that to me on the screen where I can accept the call. And even if does nothing to the call, I can still use a <strong>Screen Call </strong>button to kick the call to a digital assistant, where the caller is invited to state the reason for the call.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/call_screen_assistant.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Example call-screen opportunity. (This image shamelessly <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/automatic-call-screen-google-pixel-phones/">stolen</a> from XDA Developers.)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This may be mostly a Pixel feature right now. Google plans to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-will-soon-be-downloadable-from-play-store-verified-calls-feature-rolling-out/">extend</a> this to more Android brands. Because Samsung uses its own, poor quality dialer, it’s unclear how Samsung will get this feature.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Apple only has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099">crude tool</a>: block callers not in your contacts. You can’t report calls or texts as spam.</p>



<p>If you want to be more selective than Apple’s crude tool, and instead block specific spammers, you must add the spammers to your contacts. That’s dumb; it just clutters your contacts!</p>



<p>You can also subscribe to a third party service. That’s grating, because the phone should manage that itself, given that this is a years-old problem.</p>



<h3><span id="Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>Browser ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>On Android, browser ad-blocking is easy: Switch to the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Firefox browser</a>. Inside Firefox, add the free <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin extension</a>. Then set Firefox as your default browser for happy browsing. Simple! (Android’s Chrome browser does not support extensions.)</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162">AdGuard app</a>, jump through several fussy hoops in the <strong>Settings </strong>console’s <strong>Safari </strong>area, and get nagged about going to paid AdGuard. </p>



<p>Maybe I am fussing too much. The hassle is a one-time step, and AdGuard seems to work decently.</p>



<p>Part of the point of ad-blocking is to make YouTube worthwhile. That leads to my next point…</p>



<h3><span id="YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>YouTube ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>To block YouTube’s ads on Android, just view all YouTube content in Firefox with the uBlock Origin extension. Easy!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While Safari + AdGuard = ads blocked on YouTube, it’s still a major regression from Android:</p>



<ul><li>Video quality <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aom6ge/why_does_youtube_only_go_up_to_720p_on_mobile/">maxes out at 720p</a>.</li><li>Every YouTube video in Safari starts as low quality (360p). To change it, on <em>every video you watch</em>, you must wade through the settings menu, and it has to be done before you switch to full screen, because of the next bullet’s deficiency.</li><li>When you’re viewing a video in a browser and switch to full screen, Apple cancels the website’s native video player and forces you to use iOS’s default, bad, native video player. Want to double-tap and skip 10 seconds? Want to access the site’s in-video settings? Want any feature not supported by iOS’s dumbed down video control? Forget it! iOS nukes it in full-screen mode.</li></ul>



<p>Firefox Focus is not a solution. It doesn’t fix iOS’s deficiencies.</p>



<h3><span id="Universal_back_button_Android_wins"></span>Universal back button: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>For at least a decade, Android has had a back button at the bottom of all windows. This means the valuable concept of “take me back” is baked into the Android paradigm. Need to return where you were, in <em>any</em> app? Just tap the back button, on bottom left of the screen. Or use the back gesture (next section).</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> The back button is a mess.</p>



<p>In Safari, it’s on bottom left.</p>



<p>In most other apps, top left.</p>



<p>To get to the prior app that sent you to the current app, find a tiny button between the app’s top-left back button and the clock. And good luck on that; too much of the time, iOS lists a wrong or irrelevant prior app, especially if you got to your current app from a system notification.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="449" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x132.png 300w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x337.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Even though the mini back button says otherwise, I was not sent to GroupMe by NPR One! I was sent there by a notification I tapped while NPR One was active.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, because the non-Safari back buttons are on the opposite end of the phone from where you hold it, you’re less precise with finger positioning. Therefore, when you intend to use a “back” feature, you’ll instead make the phone think you’re trying to pull down the notification area.</p>



<h3><span id="Gestures_Android_wins"></span>Gestures: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Building on its native strengths, Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6073614?hl=en">gestures</a> are excellent. They edge out iOS with the back gesture, which I use a lot. No matter what app you’re in, swipe in from the phone’s right to go back. Simple!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Without a “back” gesture, you’re stuck fumbling with iOS’s haphazard back buttons.</p>



<h3><span id="Exiting_apps_Android_wins"></span>Exiting apps: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>In Android, you can exit apps with the back gesture or swiping up from the bottom. The back gesture is superior, because it can’t be confused with other gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Your only choice is the swipe-up gesture, which sometimes conflicts with normal swipes one does in apps.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I don’t literally mean app-exiting in the computer-science sense. I mean more in a common-parlance sense: you’re out of the app and back to the home screen, or in another app that may have called the current app. One an app is no longer visible, and running in the background, Android and iOS both do fine managing it.</p>



<h3><span id="Ambient_display_Android_wins"></span>Ambient display: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>The Pixel has a great feature: even when you’re not using the phone, it shows the current time on the screen, along with some other useful information. This takes minimal power: thanks to the OLED screen, the main power use is when it lights up the specific pixels that show the time.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-225x300.png 225w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Ambient display. This Pixel 4 XL is not active. It’s basically in sleep mode. It uses minimal power to give me useful information on its OLED screen.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While the iPhone also has an OLED screen, Apple has no similar feature. You have to tap the phone to see the time, which lights up the whole screen.</p>



<h3><span id="Treating_me_like_an_adult_Android_wins"></span>Treating me like an adult: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s UX language is simply clean. It’s intuitive, simple, and it just works.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> iOS’s UX feels like a cartoon spoof of a phone OS. Naturally garish colors, toddler-like corner-rounding, goofy font sizes, etc. It’s like iOS’s design semantics were intended to tussle with our innate senses. Barf!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="473" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png 473w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-139x300.png 139w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x1662.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-710x1536.png 710w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-947x2048.png 947w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>When a toddler breaks out crayons and designs a phone, this is what you get.</figcaption></figure>



<h3><span id="Application_organization_Android_wins"></span>Application organization: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>All newly installed Android apps go into the app drawer. This is an alphabetized list of apps, accessed by swiping up from a home screen (when you’re not inside an app).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png" alt="" width="485" height="1024" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png 485w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-142x300.png 142w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-768x1621.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-728x1536.png 728w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-970x2048.png 970w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px"><figcaption>Android app drawer.

<p>Suppose you have 150 apps. That is 30 rows of five icons each, all in alpha sort. It’s fast to find any application.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> It wasn’t until <em>this year</em> that Apple delivered its poor ripoff of the app drawer. Before then, people were stuck with jumbled messes of icons on multiple home-screen pages.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple, cheap data pipeline to pull small amounts of data from a stable API and store it in a cloud storage, then <code>serverless functions</code> are a good choice. This post aims to answer questions like the ones shown below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My company does not have the budget to purchase a tool like <code>fivetran</code>, What should I use to pull data from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I really need an orchestration tool like Airflow for one simple data pull from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the post we cover what a <code>serverless</code> function can and cannot do, what its pros and cons are and walk through a simple API data pull project.</p>

<p>Chances are that you have heard of the term <code>serverless</code>. The term <code>serverless</code> may be misleading. In fact, there is a server on which your code will be running. <code>Serverless</code> refers to the fact that you do not have to manage any servers, but just the code. We will use <code>AWS Lambda</code> for this simple project. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?c=ser&amp;sec=srv"><code>AWS Lambda</code></a> can be used to run a function without having to provision and maintain a server.</p>
<p>You write a function and deploy it to AWS Lambda. There you can set the function to run based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/understanding-the-different-ways-to-invoke-lambda-functions/">external triggers</a>. The lambda function will execute the logic and end. Note that you will have a limited time (current max execution time for lambda code execution is 15min) for your code logic to complete. There is also a limit on the memory size(current max is at 3.008GB). In this post we will</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the lambda function.</li>
<li>Download data from a dummy API to local file system.</li>
<li>Copy the downloaded files to AWS S3.</li>
<li>Stop the lambda function.</li>
<li>The lambda function will be scheduled to run every 5 minutes.</li>

<p>Let’s assume you work for a company that wants to pull some data from an API that you have access to and assess the quality of that data. Your responsibility is to pull this data and make it available via cloud storage for other systems to consume and assess quality. Let’s assume that this is your first and only data pull(for now). There is not enough time/ money to set up/buy a data orchestration tool. This project is to validate the value that this data may provide, based on which your company can choose to either continue paying for this data or not.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Account</a></li>
<li>AWS CLI <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">installed</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">configured</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h3>
<p>Let us assume that our API has the following documentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>API endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</code> to get user post data.</li>
<li>Query parameters: The data returned from the API is sorted by user_id. Using <code>start_user_id</code> and <code>end_user_id</code> we can query for a range of data based on user ids.</li>
<li>API metadata endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/number_of_users</code>, will return the total number of user posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GET endpoint will return a list of JSON with the format</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"userId"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"some title here"</span>,
    <span>"body"</span>: <span>"some test here"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="paginate">Paginate</h2>
<p>When pulling a “lot” of data from an API, it is general best practice to make multiple requests to pull data in chunks. The definition of a lot of data depends on the amount of data being pulled and the API stability. Based on the <code>API Documentation</code> above, we need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li>Split the number into N number of calls, depending on a predefined <code>CHUNK</code> size. Which is the amount of data you want to pull per API call.</li>
<li>Make the API call, pull the data and write it to a local disk storage. You can also store in memory if the data size is sufficiently small.</li>
<li>Some APIs may fail due to network or other issues, add a retry parameter to account for this. In reality this will depend on the stability of the API and the network.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the size of data and the allocated lambda memory, it may be more efficient to keep data in memory instead of writing to disk and then uploading to S3.</p>
<p>Lets create a folder called <code>dataPull</code> in your project directory and within it a python script called <code>lambda_function.py</code>, starting with the content below</p>

</code></pre></div><p>In the above code snippet, we have the functions</p>
<ol>
<li><code>get_num_records</code> to simulate the GET call to your API to get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li><code>download_data</code> to make multiple calls to the API and only accessing 10,000 data records per API data pull. This 10,000 is defined as a global variable <code>CHUNK_SIZE</code>. In your project you will need to determine what this size is depending on API stability, memory constraints, network connection and general best practice size for that API.</li>
<li><code>parse_data</code> to convert the json data into a row format string, which gets written to a local file.</li>
<li><code>write_to_local</code> to write the downloaded chunk of data into the local file system. In our case if we have 100,000 records we will generate 10 files name <code>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</code> with the data for user ids <code>0-10000, 10000-20000,...90000-100000</code> correspondingly. Note the local file system location <code>/tmp</code> will only be available for the duration of a single run of your function.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4>
<p>In the above snippet, since we are downloading chunks independently we can also make it concurrent using python’s <code>asyncio</code> library. If you are using concurrency be very aware of the number of open connections/ file handlers, etc. You can also manage concurrency at the lambda function level as shown <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_console">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note some API may not provide the exact number of records, instead you will have to query until no more data is available (usually using some sort of <code>search_after</code> query parameter). In such cases concurrency will be difficult to achieve since you will need the output from the previous call to make the next API call. An example of this is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-search-after.html"><code>ElasticSearch's</code> search_after</a>. There is also the <code>from, size</code> type API endpoints which requires the size of data to pull and an id from which to start pulling data as query parameters to the API call.</p>

<p>Since lambda functions are temporary, so are their local storage. We need to make sure our locally stored data (at <code>/tmp</code>) gets stored in a persistent storage system such as <code>AWS S3</code>. Add the below code to <code>lambda_function.py</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Not interested in the back story? </strong>Jump ahead to <a href="#introducing-localizer">Introducing Localizer</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Before we get into the details of what localizer is and how it came to be, it's crucial that we look at what developer environments were and the motivations behind the ones I create.</p><p>Ever since I wrote my first ever <a href="https://github.com/staymarta/dev">developer environment</a> for the now-defunct <a href="https://github.com/staymarta">StayMarta</a>, I've always focused on one thing: ease of use. For a docker-compose based development environment, this was a relatively simple task. Create Docker containers, write a compose file, declare ports, and they'd be available on my local machine. It was as simple as <code>docker-compose up</code>. While this approach didn't necessarily match what production looked like, it was really the best option available for containers at the time. Options that exist now, such as Kubernetes, weren't available, which rendered <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/">equality between production and development a work-in-progress dream</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, at my first larger-scale startup, <a href="https://azuqua.com/">Azuqua</a>, I had a chance to reimagine what a developer environment looked like under a whole new set of constraints. While Docker Compose works for small teams, it falls apart when you map it to production systems. At the time, our production system was based on Chef. Docker Compose doesn't map to Ruby-based Chef configuration files. When I joined Azuqua, the pain around having separate tooling for infrastructure had become incredibly clear. It wasn't sustainable to have an entire team; write the configuration for our services, communicate with developers why infrastructure can't infinitely scale without good software design, and do it all without blame or single points of failure. Fundamentally this is why I take issue with DevOps teams and prefer promoting the <a href="https://sre.google/">Google SRE Model</a> instead. While at Azuqua, we started a transition to an SRE model and used Kubernetes as a way to help facilitate that.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/kind-1.png" alt="KinD Logo"></figure><p>While at Azuqua, I identified the need to run Kubernetes to ease cloud resources' scalability and improve the developer experience. At the same time, this <strong>drastically decreased the developer experience</strong>. While this may seem contradictory at first, it's essential to consider the multiple ways that developer experience presents itself. While at first, it may seem like it's just tooling to test/write code, it's a combination of testing code, writing code, and deploying that code. With the Docker Compose environment at StayMarta, we made the test/build cycle incredibly simple but shifted the deploy aspects onto a bespoke team, the DevOps model. That approach works for small teams, but as you grow, this quickly doesn't scale. If you can't deploy code efficiently, the developer experience is frustrating and promptly turns to an unhealthy relationship with the team responsible for that cycle.</p><p>Going back to how Kubernetes <em>improved the developer experience</em>, which I assure you it does. The benefit to Kubernetes was that it brought a control plane into the mix and focused on being just a container orchestrator. The DSL it does have is highly specific to orchestrating containers and making them work. The control-plane allows self-healing and building tooling to enable all different types of use-cases consistently. While it lacks abstractions, it brings something to developers they've never had before, the ability to deploy code reproducibly. With the introduction of <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a>, <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a>, and others, you could now run the same stack you run in production, but locally.</p><p>The ability to reproducibly deploy helps both deployment confidence and the amount of time needed to get from nothing to running in production. However, it's not without its faults. Whenever you start moving deployment tooling onto developers, you've decreased the developer experience. It's unavoidable because you're introducing net new materials, DSLs, and more for the developers to learn. While <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a> and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> are great projects, they all suffer from needing developers to understand how to work with Kubernetes. You need to be able to build a Docker image, push the docker image into the cluster, delete the application pod, verify if it's even using the correct tag, wait for Kubernetes to recreate the container, and make sure you've configured an ingress route to access it outside of your cluster or use <code>kubectl port-forward</code> to access it. The second that breaks, you're now required to dig into why service connectivity isn't working, why your Docker image isn't in the <code>containerd</code> cache, or other not so easily solved areas. While to someone who's worked with Kubernetes for years now, this isn't very difficult, this is hardly achieving the "ease of use" goal I have.</p><p>Solving these problems is not easy. Debugging Kubernetes is difficult and requires knowledge that can only be solved with education, more tooling, or a combination of both. Unfortunately, these are not cheap. Education is hard to do correctly and tends to result in lots of time writing quickly out of date material that is hard to maintain. While at Azuqua, we encountered this same problem. Very few engineers wanted to learn Kubernetes or invest time in the technology around it. We decided to go back to the basics and focus on a tooling based approach. How do we get the same developer experience level, at a minimum, of Docker Compose with Kubernetes? Our answer ended up being a tool called <a href="https://telepresence.io/">Telepresence</a>. Telepresence describes itself as:</p><blockquote>[...] an open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster.<p><a href="https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview">https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview</a></p></blockquote><p>It seemed perfect, a tool that enabled your local machine to act as if it were running in Kubernetes and allow your services to be targeted from inside of Kubernetes. We rolled it out at Azuqua after initial tests showed it worked well, and we went with it. Unfortunately, it didn't last.</p><p>While Telepresence solved the problem of communicating with our local Kubernetes cluster, it spectacularly failed at letting services inside the cluster talk to our local services. When it worked, it worked amazingly, but nine times out of ten, it'd fail in a magnitude of ways. Whether that's failing to clean up after random crashing or slowly taking down the computer's internet connection, it generally wouldn't work. Luckily for us at Azuqua, we had a pretty well-defined system for service discovery and few services that needed to talk to one another directly. The few that needed that could just run outside of the cluster. That allowed us to accept those pains and be successful with Telepresence. To be clear, this is not a hit on Telepresence. It worked very well for us at Azuqua, but it's not a complete solution.</p><p>When I started developing a new development environment for <a href="https://outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, I again tried to use Telepresence as the solution to bridge the gap between our local cluster and our local machine. Unfortunately, it didn't work. We did not have a well-defined service discovery mechanism to work around the bugs, we had a much larger engineering team, and almost all services needed to talk to each other. We found more and more edge cases with Telepresence, and our developer experience was suffering. Our NPS score for our developer environment was at a low of -26, just because of Telepresence!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="Chart showing the NPS spread"><figcaption>For comparison, a good NPS is generally +30...&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty clear that Telepresence was not going to solve our use-cases. It was time to look into alternatives.</p><p>Telepresence was interesting since it used a VPN to give you access to your resources. However, it also required a hack DNS injector component, which tended to be the primary source of network problems. There weren't many projects out there that seemed to solve this, but one interesting one was <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">kubefwd</a>. If you're not aware of Kubernetes port-forwarding, there is a command that allows you to bring down a set of ports for a given service and have them be available on your local machine via <code>kubectl port-forward</code>. Think of the <code>-p</code> argument to <code>docker run</code>, but for Kubernetes. Unfortunately, this didn't support FQDNs (<code>.svc.cluster.local</code>), statefulsets, or all namespaces automatically. It also didn't support reverse tunneling. I wanted to keep the spirit of Telepresence by continuing to be a one-stop tool. Aside from <code>kubefwd</code>, there were seemingly no tools that could do this. Reverse tunneling into Kubernetes alone seemed to be an unsolved problem. To fill that gap, I decided to write <code>localizer</code>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jaredallard/localizer">Localizer</a> is a rewrite of Telepresence in Golang, but without the complex surface area. Its goal is to be a simple, no-frills development tool for application developers using Kubernetes. It does this by being easy to use, self-explanatory, and easy to debug. Localizer only supports what Kubernetes networking does, and acts as a daemon. This is most useful when trying to expose multiple services, developers generally had to have many terminal windows to run Telepresence or other reverse tunnel solutions. Localizer moves away from that by having all commands send a gRPC message to the daemon. More on that later. At the core of Localizer is three commands.</p><h2 id="default-creating-tunnels">Default: Creating Tunnels</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-04-at-1.28.31-PM-1.png" alt="Output from running the localizer daemon"><figcaption>Running <code>localizer</code> on my home Kubernetes Cluster (it's not limited to just local developer environments)</figcaption></figure><p>When you run <code>localizer</code> without any arguments, it automatically creates port-forwards for all Kubernetes Services (this is important), a loopback-interface powered IP address, and adds them to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Out of the box, this allows code to communicate with Kubernetes services despite being outside of the cluster.</p><h2 id="expose-creating-a-reverse-tunnel">Expose: Creating a Reverse Tunnel</h2><p>The <code>expose</code> command takes <code>namespace/service</code> as an argument that allows you to point a Kubernetes service down to your machine's service instance. When run, it automatically scales down any endpoints that already exist for the service. Localizer then creates an OpenSSH pod with the Kubernetes service's selector, which makes Kubernetes route traffic to the created pod. Localizer creates an SSH reverse proxy over a Kubernetes port-forward (which …</p></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am trying to kickstart the Common Lisp revolution from 28 november to <strong>10 december 2020</strong></a>, and as of 5 december 2020, it did look like we were going to run out of time, so this is my last-ditch attempt at rectifying the situation before it's too late. <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Please support the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser!!!</a></em></strong></p>

        <p>
          Since we are on such a tight deadline, I am soliciting donations of <strong>1000$ or more</strong> from the following organizations and people. This is the only way we can realistically make it in time.
          <br>
          I can confirm that they are all eligible for <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#perks" target="_blank">Advanced Perks</a>, including <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#lifetime-perks" target="_blank">Lifetime Perks</a>.

        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br>
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br>
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br>
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br>
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br>
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br>
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>Dear Common Lisp Foundation, Dear Dave,</p>

        <p>Thank you for giving birth to <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1041671580957466624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one of the most important conversations in the Common Lisp community</a>!</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>You are already managing <a href="https://www.common-lisp.net/" target="_blank">common-lisp.net</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/" target="_blank">cliki.net</a>, both crucial resources. It is time to unify our efforts. I <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1250142510267224065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">again</a> urge you to move to GitHub, the best open source platform, and the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> is a great occasion to demonstrate to the world what already ought to be quite obvious: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is the best code hosting platform, and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is the best open source funding platform! Let's leave <q>avoid success at all costs</q> to Haskell!</p>

        <p>
          I am not sure if your corporate processes in any way allow for such a quick turnaround time, or if you can sanely make an exception, but if in any way possible,

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br>
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

        <p><strong>Please make a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> if you wish to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now! Thank you.</strong></p>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br>
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br>
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br>
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br>
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

        <p><strong>As such, I would be extremely honored if you made a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, describes his companyâ€™s shipping culture in one of his <a href="https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships">blog posts</a>. 
</p>
<p>
They like to keep projects to one person. And every person is responsible for shipping something every single week. 
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s quite a polarizing culture. So much so that Naval makes explicit that their environment is wrong for most people. Theyâ€™re looking for independent people who can ship code and if you donâ€™t fit that type, you should go look elsewhere:
</p>


<blockquote>
    If they canâ€™t ship, release them. Our environment is wrong for them. They should go find someplace where they can thrive. Thereâ€™s someplace for everyone.
    <span>Naval Ravikant</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wish more companies would do this. When youâ€™re able to clearly outline your values, you tend to attract individuals that stick. 
</p>
<p>
And sometimes, itâ€™s just as important to list all the reasons why someone <em>wouldnâ€™t enjoy</em> working at a company as it is to list everything good about the company. 
</p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s an example from <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-Levels-Remote-Head-of-Marketing-Growth-6e64dba240404eaea9160a48f1c5f24f">Levels Healthâ€™s</a> recent job description:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_angellist/job_description.png" alt="">
</center>

<p>
Information like this is gold dust. Think about the countless <em>years</em> people waste working at companies that theyâ€™re not suited for. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, the role above would be a bad fit for me. Iâ€™m at a stage of my career where mentorship would be helpful and Iâ€™d like to execute on projects that are clearly defined in scope. 
</p>
<p>
If a company is not able to explain to me what would make someone a bad candidate for the role, then that would worry me. If youâ€™re not able to eliminate <em>anyone</em> for a role, then the job position itself has likely not been set up for success. 
</p>
<h2>Build a team that ships</h2>


<p>
I want to talk a bit more about AngelListâ€™s prolific shipping culture.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of a ceramics experiment that was done (can be traced back to this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/?tag=codihorr-20">book</a>) in which the teacher divided the class into two groups. 
</p>
<p>
One group would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, whilst the other solely on its quality.
</p>
<p>
The grading procedure was simple:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œOn the final day of class, the instructor would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to grading time. Can you guess what happened? 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œIt seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Naval acknowledges that shipping at the velocity they do is not ideal. They make mistakes and many of the features they release are half-baked. 
</p>
<p>
But it is also precisely <em>because</em> they ship so much that theyâ€™re able to get it right. Just like the â€œquantityâ€� group, the engineers at AngelList are constantly iterating and testing out their assumptions. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than always being in paralysis mode, they just build the damn thing. And if it doesnâ€™t work, they try again until it does. 
</p>

A copy of the Student Commitment to COVID-19 Community Health and Safety Requirements is attached for your review, along with this link to the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy. failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct.

• D.8 Failure to Comply
• D.13 Misrepresentation
"></p>
<p><strong>What was Brown's basis for these accusations?</strong></p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/09/28/remote-students-receive-emails-brown-accusing-violating-code-student-conduct">interview with The Brown Daily Herald</a>, University Spokesperson Brian Clark said the University evaluated a variety of indicators, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>indications of building access,</li>
<li>indications of accessing private electronic services,</li>
<li>indications of accessing secure networks, and</li>
<li>reports from community members.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mechanics of that last indicator are pretty self-explanatory, but what about the others? <a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/canvas-learning-management-system">Canvas</a> <em>doesn't</em> <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/google-wants-to-know-your-location">Want To Know Your Location</a>. <strong>In this post, I'm going to break down the technical mechanisms behind each of these indicators.</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, I do not have insider knowledge on how Brown reached its decisions. Rather, I'm going to consider each of the indicators Brian Clark named, and describe the technical mechanisms to which Brown <em>could</em> have availed itself to generating location data.</p>
<h2 id="indications-of-building-access">Indications of Building Access</h2>
<p>This is an easy one. Brown's buildings are located on Brown's campus. Brown's campus is in Providence. If you are in Brown's buildings, you are on Brown's campus, in Providence. QED.</p>
<p>At Brown, building access is primarily regulated with electronic control systems (namely Software House's <a href="https://www.swhouse.com/products/software_CCURE9000.aspx"><strong>C•CURE 9000</strong></a> system), not mechanical keys.</p>
<p>Encoded on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card#Track_2">track 2</a> of the magnetic stripe on every University ID card is a sixteen digit number that uniquely identifies the card:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/brown-id-card-back.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Image of back of Brown ID card. A tall magnetic stripe runs across the entire width of the card."></p>
<p>Well, that's underwhelming — of <em>course</em> you can't <em>see</em> it! However, up until 2017 or 2018, this number was also <em>printed</em> on the front of ID cards, just above the card-holder's name:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/brown-id-card-front.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Image fo the front of a Brown ID card, displaying the building access code: 6009553660926201"></p>
<p>This pseudo-random identifier (well, its last ten digits) are what uniquely identify you whenever you swipe your Brown ID card <em>anywhere</em>. And, if you lose your Brown ID card, this is the <em>only</em> thing that's changed when you're issued a replacement. Convenient! In contrast, when you lose your dorm room's mechanical key, Brown must replace (or rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rekeying">rekey</a>) the locks.</p>
<p>But, <em>also</em> unlike a mechanical key, <em>every</em> swipe of a Brown ID card is logged in a central database. <strong>The C•CURE 9000 lets administrators view the complete historical building access history of a person.</strong> Last Spring, Brown used this mechanism to identify and prod students who were slow to evacuate Providence.</p>
<h2 id="indicators-from-electronic-services">Indicators from Electronic Services</h2>
<p>University web services like Canvas <em>don't</em> directly ask you for your location. Nonetheless, accessing these services leaves a location finger print: your IP address.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> is a number that identifies your device (computer, phone, etc.) for the purposes of network routing. In principle, nobody but you and your internet provider know the <em>exact</em> mapping of your IP address to your physical address.</p>
<p>In practice, IP addresses can be used to <em>roughly</em> geolocate a device. Batches of IP addresses are associated <em>loosely</em> with geographic areas. Since every web service access leaves an IP address as a trace, there are tremendous incentives for advertisers to be able accurately identify what city or town an IP address is probably associated with.</p>
<p>Brown probably <em>isn't</em> analyzing the access logs of its <em>individual</em> web services (like Canvas). Rather, they need only to audit the access logs of its three identity access management (IAM) systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workplace</a> IAM system is used to control access to your @brown.edu email, and to the various Google Drive services. <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/4580120?hl=en"><strong>Google Workplace</strong> provides administrators with login audit logs that include users' IP addresses.</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.shibboleth.net/">Shibboleth</a> IAM system controls access to all <em>other</em> Brown web services, such as Canvas. It's what you think of as your "Brown account". Shibboleth is <em>very</em> flexible, and can be <a href="https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/AuditLoggingConfiguration#AuditLoggingConfiguration-GenericFields">configured to log IP addresses</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://duo.com/">DUO</a> is used to provide two-factor authentication for Shibboleth logins. <a href="https://help.duo.com/s/article/1023?language=en_US#docs-internal-guid-0aa3b4ce-c686-7559-8814-1377592fce4a:%7E:text=Access%20Device">It too provides administrators with detailed access logs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can partly view your Google Workplace login history for yourself by opening your Brown email and clicking "Details" in the bottom right-hand corner of the page; e.g.:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/gmail-account-activity.png" height="auto" width="100%"></p>
<p>With <em>either</em> of these access logs in hand, Brown could then turn to any number of geolocation services (<a href="https://tools.keycdn.com/geo">like this one</a>) to guess your physical location.</p>
<h2 id="indicators-from-secure-networks">Indicators from Secure Networks</h2>
<p>This is another easy one. Brown's WiFI network <a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/blog/brown-location-surveillance/Campus_Wireless_Coverage_Map_24x36_1.pdf">blankets Brown's campus</a>. Brown's campus is in Providence. If you are on Brown's WiFi network, you are on Brown's campus. QED.</p>
<p>What might surprise you is the sheer depth of surveillance that's capable with WiFi alone. This section will <em>barely</em> scratch the surface.</p>
<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<p>Brown's WiFi routers each broadcast three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)">service sets</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-network-brown">Brown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-network-eduroam">eduroam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-access-brown-guest">Brown Guest</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The Brown and eduroam networks require that you authenticate with your Brown account credentials. Brown University is thus able to identify the owner of any device connected to these networks.</p>
<p>While Brown Guest does <em>not</em> require authentication, it still provides mechanisms of identification. Your network devices broadcast a unique identifier called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address"><strong>MAC address</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://drawings.jvns.ca/mac-address/"><img type="image/svg+xml" src="https://drawings.jvns.ca/drawings/mac-address.svg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Comic by Julia Evans. Text: Every computer on the internet has a network card. When you make HTTP requests with Ethernet/WiFi, every packet gets sent to a MAC address. (&quot;Wait, how do I know someone else on the same network isn't reading all my packets?&quot; &quot;You don't! That's one reason we use HTTPS &amp; secure WiFi networks.&quot;) Your router has a table that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.  (Read about ARP for more.)
"></a></p>
<p>Brown <a href="https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies/network-connection-policy#32:%7E:text=CIS%20maintains%20a%20database%20of%20unique,a%20computer%20when%20it%20is%20necessary.">maintains databases of the MAC addresses of all connected devices</a>.</p>
<p>If you have ever connected to an authenticated network, Brown will be able to de-anonymize your connections to Brown Guest — <em>unless</em> your device implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Randomization">MAC address randomization</a>, which (as the name suggests) randomizes your device's MAC address on a per-network basis.</p>
<h3 id="localization">Localization</h3>
<p>Brown's access points log the MAC addresses of the devices that have connected to them. As of 2015, Brown retained these logs for at least several years — possibly indefinitely. Since there are so many access points on campus, which access point you are connected to can narrow your location down to a particular room. <strong>Combined, these logs paint a <em>very</em> accurate picture of your location on campus at any time.</strong></p>
<p>You do not need to be <em>actively</em> browsing the internet for Brown to know where you are via this mechanism. As you walk through campus, your phone likely <em>automatically</em> reconnects to the nearest available access point. If you are within a literal stone's throw of campus, you should assume that Brown can (roughly) identify your location.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are in range of three or more of Brown's ARUBA access points, Brown can, in principle, precisely triangulate your location. This functionality is <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/pdf/technology/whitepapers/wp_Hybrid_WIDS.pdf">common</a> in enterprise-grade WiFi infrastructure. (If you've ever tried to run a "rogue" WiFi router in your dorm room and receive an angry knock on your door — this is the mechanism by which you were located.)</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-out-more">How do I find out more?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act"><em>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</em></a> empowers students to request their education records from their University.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWzBrC8dVnw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you are a current Brown student and would like to go beyond my blog post and learn <em>exactly</em> how Brown University knows your location, <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/student-information-rightsferpa">file a FERPA request</a>. Brown University is obligated to respond within 45 days. You'll need to be specific with your request. I suggest requesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>the timestamps, MAC addresses and BSSIDs associated with your devices' connections to Brown University's wireless access points</li>
<li>the timestamps and locations associated with all building accesses conducted with your ID card</li>
<li>the login audit data associated with all Google Workplace, Shibboleth, and DUO authentications conducted by your accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"><em>General Data Protection Regulation</em></a> gives EU citizens and residents expansive control over how their personally identifiable information (PII) is used, and the right to request a copy of or the destruction of collected data. I believe these requests should be directed to <a href="https://compliance.brown.edu/">Brown's compliance office</a>. You might be able to do this even if you're a Brown alumni.</p>
<p><strong>If you attempt either of these steps, <a href="mailto:jack@wrenn.fyi">please get in touch</a>!</strong> I'm very curious as to what Brown is <em>actually</em> doing.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-surveillance-cameras">Bonus: Surveillance Cameras</h2>
<p>As of February 2020, <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/02/21/cameras-installed-hegeman-hall/#post-2838338:%7E:text=The%20University%20uses%20approximately%20800%20cameras,with%20high%20crime%20activity%2C%20Porter%20said."><em>eight hundred</em> surveillance cameras monitor campus 24/7</a>. Brown has as about as many surveillance cameras as it has full-time faculty! This map documents a <em>mere seven percent</em> of Brown University's total camera surveillance capacity:</p>

<p><small>This map displays data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>. <a href="https://pietervdvn.github.io/Staging/surveillance.html?z=17&amp;lat=41.82681&amp;lon=-71.4016">Help improve its accuracy!</a></small></p><p>Brown University has a longstanding policy governing the appropriate uses of its surveillance cameras. <strong>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2008/01/10/surveillance-cameras-on-campus-triple/#post-1679525:%7E:text=DPS%20would%20not%20release%20the%20University%E2%80%99s%20full%20policy%20on%20the%20surveillance%20camera%20system">this policy is secret</a>.</strong></p>
<p>While Brown probably does not <em>currently</em> have the capacity to both broadly and deeply inspect the firehose of data produced by these cameras, expect this to change in the near future. Axis Communications, Brown's primary supplier of surveillance cameras, <a href="https://www.axis.com/customer-story/3767">now touts cameras that can perform <em>on-board</em> facial recognition</a>. And Software House, the provider of the C•CURE 9000 access control system, has begun marketing the integration of facial recognition with its access control systems:</p>

<p>PostgreSQL, or Postgres for short, comes with many out-of-the-box features that make it very popular among developers and data engineers. Among the numerous benefits of implementing Postgres are that there are many approaches to take to scale your database horizontally or vertically—but that is a discussion for a whole different article. Postgres comes with plenty of add-ons and a strong community of developers behind it too for open-source support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from plugins that you can quickly add a variety of tools and resources to your Postgres suite to expand the many functionalities of your Postgres database system to help you take your use of Postgres to the next level. This article shares the top 62 tools, plugins, and add-ons in that suite for you to improve your Postgres operations and productivity quickly and efficiently.</p>



<h2><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></h2>



<p>Postgres doesn’t come with a native GUI, but that doesn’t mean you cannot manage your Postgres databases using a simple user interface. Web-based GUIs and tools for this specific purpose are easy to find.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/plt54JgoE56tK9XTfy0n77S5kbUU3yOsxHuFncLuPYsC32QWHl9NQUTVulFjqJupJRB5i-Uvwy3u9NF0liPb4C2BCrEjvxNcZfSaUe2kJtPap4fiC3INTgPJubPtRHRhwi3zFGTl" alt="#DataGrip" width="254" height="113"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Datagrip</a></li></ol>



<p>DataGrip is a tool that helps simplify managing multiple databases. It is compatible with multiple database systems, including PostgreSQL. You get a graphical interface for managing databases, running queries, and completing routine maintenance tasks. This tool is very popular at Cherre.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/D0s1cOPz_g7XyuUoASoiIubUy5ZC5w3F5dSNp9KGUWF1alKUJCH-DzzBdO0yK_fgvUmG9_L1K59jYcq3OWfgrICkU6ov5uV9ukGNZQycHZvllxvtMZLYI_QfQEj1rroavXbnLVeb" alt="#DBeaver" width="216" height="108"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://dbeaver.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DBeaver&nbsp;</a></li></ol>



<p>The latest version of DBeaver, 7.1.4, includes data editing features that are designed to be intuitive. DBeaver, however, offers more than data editing. It supports PostgreSQL and many other database systems.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EIl8uFSl3bnrnLWOE5xbNYy_PLs0Gb1g5xC3CuhqGN_6Snr8DmyO0NI7BDxhRuKqqreLGm4hPwMTfA970hSC--k1D3UKg_xsNYk6qgnX5bTM9HFDX5IlPQhLTXC98UN3eEzLWuJu" alt="#Navicat" width="267" height="108"></figure>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://www.navicat.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Navicat for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Navicat is not a new name in the database landscape. Its product for Postgres is designed to offer you all the tools you need to manage complex databases. There are also data visualization tools available within.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FQ2Tdygv9EVAvWLrJo8Ab9jA-L1cBtv3ek41rVaaVmCKLfYyHpJewvoy6dlmIiuNaLFODhsDHFdMfeotCx9cmcoBzxLFbpAN_efDh5s13Qzn2xFSXFfQkAmqlucDgfMf4wPhxzT6" alt="#Pgadmin" width="113" height="117"></figure>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pgadmin</a></li></ol>



<p>When it comes to keeping Postgres maintenance and management simple, Postgres has pgADmin. The web-based option now supports external configuration files and runs completely in the cloud. You can use it as a way to manage database clusters. However, it feels a little limited compared to a full gui.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.valentina-db.com/en/studio-for-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valentina Studio for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Valentina Studio comes in different flavors, but even the free version is capable enough for managing multiple Postgres databases. It supports forms, can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, and simplifies data transfer between databases.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/doku.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phpPgAdmin</a></li></ol>



<p>MySQL has phpMyAdmin, and PostgreSQL has phpPgAdmin. If you are familiar with phpMyAdmin, then you will have no trouble using the Postgres version. The features and tools are relatively the same with a few adjustments.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FHiWWzHKdvKOGEwdNi_FFJ4cmSFLW208aREpKrHw-fdNhR0AnIx7N5Rpe5_wVhnVpbGYfrF3dZJFVSjdse4ye7fXvVna-WxaW8oP94ZPEwl6VH5mOYfTCfoo12EQOp5mq8FgAc8A" alt="#Metabase" width="195" height="146"></figure>



<ol start="7"><li><a href="https://www.metabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metabase</a></li></ol>



<p>Metabase is more of a data processing tool with advanced UIs. Rather than complex queries, it allows you to answer questions by visualizing insights collected from the PostgreSQL databases that you maintain.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z1m1CLoiqrVOz1S1LHm1SJDB5RkgizMFx8mqRC-GWyMs7gfrhAMoCHwOe9yGqKGJpWYPxJM62NgdJVAKJy6NwbYcszplUaCl0o1SOs68VgNsjFIc_sljbRRimFGeJPIodS_Zqn3_" alt="#Slemma" width="240" height="80"></figure>



<ol start="8"><li><a href="https://slemma.com/connectors/database-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slemma</a></li></ol>



<p>Slemma is far from just another GUI for Postgres. It takes data visualization to another level by introducing automation. Reports from a series of entries can be generated automatically based on parameters and the kind of insights you want to get in return.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vDAmrWbVqi9izoCkHpRiHKd7KC8sbos8p_L7tgBOLz-2EuI12hFg1BuhY9vgDfdyUGd__ChCmc37rpimb4LMqXPYnzLP7RHDqnU6_5PWA_B4UK5SZu6lEHxfZAwqSKcNxrGZF7CP" alt="#windwardstudios" width="331" height="76"></figure>



<ol start="9"><li><a href="https://www.windwardstudios.com/datasource/postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windward Studios</a></li></ol>



<p>Windward is the last GUI tool on our list with a special trick up its sleeve: it can be integrated with Microsoft Office natively. You can use Office apps to design templates for reports or to visualize your report using data stored in Postgres.</p>



<h2><strong>Utilities</strong></h2>



<p>Utilities for Postgres are usually designed to do specific things. While PostgreSQL doesn’t require special maintenance, it is still a good idea to integrate good utilities into your database management workflow. The best utilities tools will certainly make your life as a database engineer easier.</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pg_catcheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pg_catcheck</a></li></ol>



<p>System catalog corruption can be a huge problem that can bring an entire Postgres database down when it happens. Depending on the severity of the corruption, you may also lose entries and valuable information. Use pg_catheck to monitor for system catalog corruption.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="http://www.pgbouncer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pgBouncer</a></li></ol>



<p>As the name suggests, pgBouncer acts as the bouncer that prevents unauthorized access. The common use case for this tool is to manage connections, similar to a load balancer. While Postgres is relatively secure as long as you follow the best practices, having encrypted SCRAM secrets used for storing passwords is a good idea.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://hypopg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HypoPG</a></li></ol>



<p>Hypotheticals are not always possible—and are certainly difficult to keep track of—and HypoPG is here to solve those challenges. It is basically a virtual index that doesn’t really consume cloud resources. It can also handle hypothetical partitioning.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://www.postgis.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PostGIS</a></li></ol>



<p>PostGIS fills one specific hole, lack of native support for spatial information. Postgres users can now use PostGIS to use location information in queries. If your app relies on location data, this utility certainly helps.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/postgres-fdw.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Postgres_fdw</a></li></ol>



<p>Foreign-data wrapper makes accessing external Postgres databases possible. Postgres_fdw takes that idea one step further and makes the whole process easier.&nbsp; In short you can use objects from other databases, without having to sync the two together, Postgres_fdw inexpensively makes it look like it’s in both. After installing the utility, you can create a foreign server object and work with user mapping accordingly.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="https://www.yohz.com/dbdoc_details.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DB Doc for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>While launching a new app or distributing it to a client is a fairly straightforward process, making sure that the app is used properly—and is developed with care—is still difficult. DB Doc for PostgreSQL takes care of creating documentation for your projects.</p>



<h2><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></h2>



<p>Being able to utilize Postgres without having to manage the entire cloud infrastructure supporting it is something that many development teams want these days. Organizations turn to managed database services so that they can utilize the features of Postgres without the usual complications. Fortunately, there are several solutions being offered as Platform as a Service or PaaS.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gxEUzL5xD9FYbEf-O1dSweSDqCeuqH29GAw6U5GyrdwRC_SO5VV4V9XPG3JysT_7F9kcsa-iE0r265pi6RwU5uzXM-tpSnsRHqLHsKTX7VlyNJC4Vx1grypmnH3oFvmQwyzQo2nW" alt="#AmazonRDSforPostgreSQL" width="118" height="132"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Amazon’s RDS is perhaps the most popular option of them all, offering cloud relational databases as managed services. It has Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, which allows you to forget about storage, deployment cycles, availability, and backup while taking full advantage of what Postgres has to offer.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nS9uoXzAn68iKWqAXzTgHzMuvjQHn1hmVqNshUIYCWstM0cHCt6EbVAdiormaASkc-li1fJ1JWz71885r6tTmODgpyRt6J_gYBjbT1W3jaQwoOjMMg7HPYBOBYhqb5UfvyS8QJro" alt="#aiven" width="173" height="91"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://aiven.io/postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aiven for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Aiven for PostgreSQL is another option when it comes to fully managed SQL databases. You can give the platform a try for free before switching to one of the paid plans that suit your needs best. Even better, Aiven runs on AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud ecosystems for better availability.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iIeJzX5JFZAPYm24YDmJo3HzHIUgSfrhyGhrm15jrIPLNWot_qIWi3UDmEf7_2l2fn4Pxa2TsGECybWOVjqhOPiuRlNSyXiURZjhJT_Z9TAMg8bPSNEwyCrey_1jpPUCby_w8bAE" alt="#CloudSQLforPostgreSQL" width="137" height="128"></figure>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL is Google’s version of managed relational databases in the cloud. As part of Google Cloud, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL integrates well with other GCP services, plus it can be used to support apps running in a multi-cloud environment thanks to its comprehensive API.</p>

<p>Amazon has one. Google has one. So it is not surprising to see Microsoft offering the Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Azure doesn’t just offer another PaaS for Postgres users, though. It leans heavily on scalability and offers intelligent performance recommendations—powered by machine learning—as one of its features.</p>

<p>Heroku PostgreSQL offers all the Postgres features you will ever need, but without making the entire platform cluttered or too complicated. Available in the United States and Europe, Heroku PostgreSQL is also affordable thanks to its nano and micro plans.</p>



<h2><strong>Applications</strong></h2>



<p>There are a lot of tools designed to make designing Postgres databases, creating relationships, managing tables, and organizing the entire PostgreSQL platform easier, but most of them are designed to offer specific features. In this part, we are going to take a look at the two Postgres applications that you can use for end-to-end database design and management.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BNG9GB5GDj0UgmVKyLRJ2PFYbJBXPHemZTxuUfYYy3_WrsOTDydLH4eORC3gQwSQ6Bu38EGkcxzKd6N6yJ4emc88wRIhz9rQIZ-U6FrdXtxxRF21JdT2Toj9_vOWosaLeyTDG-ZA" alt="#agileBase" width="129" height="115"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="http://www.agilebase.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agileBase</a></li></ol>



<p>AgileBase is famous for its low-code or no-code approach. You don’t have to be a database specialist—or any specialist for that matter—to build your own platform and support the application you want to deliver. AgileBase’s PostgreSQL features are designed as blocks and can be customized to your liking.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4COODpGprHglQA440b4to0ipwxVG3SIqAZJNOyqHQ_aERyOUZENL9c6nFzn5ue05rXnVomRuQRV9pkeF_m9T6l8cX9vZ2ojPzYanMVYL2HJgjWgDa3ZfrRrFk2AXoCqmXb28SKF-" alt="#Dataedo" width="255" height="78"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://dataedo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dataedo</a></li></ol>



<p>Dataedo is all about simplicity. You can manage even the most complex Postgres database through the app’s simple user interface. Even relationships are displayed visually and can be edited as such. This is a great app to use if you don’t want complex database management to be a bottleneck in your pipeline.</p>



<h2><strong>High-Availability</strong></h2>



<p>A database always sits at the core of the application that uses it. Database failures and unreliable database systems are unacceptable because they tend to bring the entire application down with them. That is why PostgreSQL is best implemented in a highly available environment, and these tools are the ones to use if you want to monitor high availability.</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/">B</a><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G</a><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/">R</a></li></ol>



<p>The PostgreSQL Dashboard offers access to key metrics that make ensuring high availability easier. There is no need to go through logs manually. Insights are displayed visually and you can go straight to refining your cloud infrastructure to boost the reliability of your database system.</p>

        <p><a href="https://daniel-lange.com/categories/17-Strategy"><img title="Strategy: Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value. (Marechal Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre)" alt="Strategy" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/strategy.serendipityThumb.jpg"></a></p><p>The Linux Foundation has published its <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf">annual report</a> today. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

        <p>Bonus round:</p>

<p>The Ethernet port, the USB ports and the headset connector are on the left side of the MacBook. The Daily Mail got it right.</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/rust-gh.png" alt="gh template releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example/blob/01e0aae91f83e1e932f4498a0eddb2905c8fffc3/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L57-L63">This</a>
is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>
tool with the rest of the world in order to avoid this pain to as many people as possible. 😅</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoIeni">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MarcoIeni">YouTube</a>, bye! 👋</p>

Transcend makes privacy laws easy for engineers and lawyers alike. In that spirit, we've transcribed this law into something easily referenceable.</p></span></p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div name="Section1"><h2>SEC. 1. Title.</h2><p>This measure shall be known and may be cited as "The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020."</p></div><div name="Section2"><h2>SEC. 2. Findings and Declarations.<!-- --> </h2><p>The People of the State of California hereby find and declare all of the following:</p><p>A. In 1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to include the right of privacy among the "Inalienable" rights of all people. Voters acted in response to the accelerating encroachment on personal freedom and security caused by increased data collection and usage in contemporary society. The amendment established a legal and enforceable constitutional right of privacy for every Californian. Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to control the use, including the sale, of their personal information.</p><p>B. Since California voters approved the constitutional right of privacy, the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to safeguard Californians' privacy, including the Online Privacy Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, and Shine the Light, but consumers had no right to learn what personal information a business had collected about them and how they used it or to direct businesses not to sell the consumer's personal information.</p><p>C. That changed in 2018, when more than 629,000 California voters signed petitions to qualify the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 for the ballot. In response to the measure's qualification, the Legislature enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) into law. The CCPA gives California consumers the right to learn what information a business has collected about them, to delete their personal information, to stop businesses from selling their personal information, including using it to target them with ads that follow them as they browse the internet from one website to another, and to hold businesses accountable if they do not take reasonable steps to safeguard their personal information.</p><p>D. Even before the CCPA had gone into effect, the Legislature considered many bills in 2019 to amend the law, some of which would have significantly weakened it. Unless California voters take action, the hard-fought rights consumers have won could be undermined by future legislation.</p><p>E. Rather than diluting privacy rights, California should strengthen them over time. Many businesses collect and use consumers' personal information, sometimes without consumers' knowledge regarding the business's use and retention of their personal information. In practice, consumers are often entering into a form of contractual arrangement in which while they do not pay money for a good or service, they exchange access to that good or service in return for access to their attention, or access to their personal information. Because the value of the personal information they are exchanging for the good or service is often opaque, depending on the practices of the business, consumers often have no good way to value the transaction. In addition, the terms of agreement or policies in which the arrangements are spelled out, are often complex, unclear, and as a result most consumers never have the time to read or understand them.</p><p>F. This asymmetry of information makes it difficult for consumers to understand what they are exchanging and therefore to negotiate effectively with businesses. Unlike in other areas of the economy where consumers can comparison shop, or can understand at a glance if a good or service is expensive or affordable, it is hard for the consumer to know how much his or her information is worth to any given business, when data use practices vary so widely between businesses.</p><p>G. The State therefore has an interest in mandating laws that will allow consumers to understand more fully how their information is being used, and for what purposes. In the same way that ingredient labels on foods help consumers shop more effectively, disclosure around data management practices will help consumers become more informed counterparties in the data economy, and promote competition, Additionally, if a consumer can tell a business not to sell his or her data, then that consumer will not have to scour a privacy policy to see whether the business is, In fact, selling that data, and the resulting savings in time is worth, in the aggregate, a tremendous amount of money.</p><p>H. Consumers need stronger laws to place them on a more equal footing when negotiating with businesses in order to protect their rights, Consumers should be entitled to a clear explanation of the uses of their personal information, including how it is used for advertising, and to control, correct, or delete it, Including by allowing consumers to limit businesses' use of their sensitive personal information to help guard against identity theft, to opt-out of the sale and sharing of their personal information, and to request that businesses correct inaccurate information about them.</p><p>I. California is the world leader in many new technologies that have reshaped our society. The world today is unimaginable without the internet, one of the most momentous inventions in human history, and the new services and businesses that arose on top of it -- many of which were invented here in California. One of the most successful business models for the internet has been services that rely on advertising to make money as opposed to charging consumers a fee. Advertising-supported services have existed for generations, and can be a great model for consumers and businesses alike. However, some advertising businesses today use technologies and tools that are opaque to consumers to collect and trade vast amounts of personal information, to track them across the internet, and to create detailed profiles of their individual interests. Some companies that do not charge consumers a fee, subsidize these services by monetizing consumers' personal information. Consumers should have the information and tools necessary to limit the use of their information to non-invasive, pro-privacy advertising, where their personal information is not sold to or shared with hundreds of businesses they've never heard of, If they choose to do so. Absent these tools, it will be virtually impossible for consumers to fully understand these contracts they are essentially entering into when they interact with various businesses.</p><p>J. Children are particularly vulnerable from a negotiating perspective with respect to their privacy rights. Parents should be able to control what information is collected and sold or shared about their young children and should be given the right to demand that companies erase information collected about their children.</p><p>K. Business should also be held directly accountable to consumers for data security breaches and notify consumers when their most sensitive information has been compromised.</p><p>L. An independent watchdog whose mission is to protect consumer privacy should ensure that businesses and consumers are well-informed about their rights and obligations and should vigorously enforce the law against businesses that violate consumers' privacy rights.</p></div><div name="Section3"><h2>SEC. 3. Purpose and Intent.</h2><p>In enacting this Act, It is the purpose and intent of the people of the State of California to further protect consumers' rights, including the constitutional right of privacy. The implementation of this Act shall be guided by the following principles:</p><h3>A. Consumer Rights</h3><p>1. Consumers should know who is collecting their personal information and that of their children, how it is being used, and to whom it is disclosed, so that they have the information necessary to exercise meaningful control over businesses' use of their personal information and that of their children,</p><p>2.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The corner of the internet that I read is awash with posts about feature stores: systems that aim to be <a href="https://blog.feast.dev/post/what-is-a-feature-store">“the interface between models and data.”</a></p>

<p>This idea has been around for quite a while, but there are now an increasing number of companies that are building feature store platforms or products–the concept is becoming established in the machine learning system <em>operations</em> arena.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I built a feature store at <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>; in light of that, I thought I’d share some of the thinking that motivated my team to need to build one and how I designed it.</p>

<p>As a broad summary: the feature store that I built does not solve for the many different use cases that you may hear about feature store products–our feature store focuses on regularly and safely transferring data between our analytics and production stacks.</p>

<p>Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="-isnt-a-feature-store-just-a-database">🤔 Isn’t a feature store just a database?</h2>

<p>Well, yes. But also no.</p>

<p>When I first started talking about the idea of a feature store internally, some feedback that I received was ‘we already do this–we just haven’t been calling them feature stores.’ Indeed, the emphasis of the name “feature store” has often been on the “<strong>store</strong>” aspect, which does make the whole thing sound like it is just a database. The word “<strong>feature</strong>” is often used to mean “some type of data” (e.g., a column in a table).</p>

<p>At Monzo, you can’t look at any corner of our <a href="https://qconlondon.com/london2020/presentation/modern-banking-1500-microservices">production infrastructure</a> without running into the key-value store we use, Cassandra. In our systems, it’s common for each microservice to have its own keyspace, and for individual services to collect, aggregate, and store the different types of data that they need.</p>

<p>We already had two patterns across several systems which looked like “feature stores:”</p>

<ol>
  <li>Services that receive a request, fan out a bunch of calls to other services, and then munge and store the resulting features. For example, we have a system that filters help articles, and caches features about users, who will be actively navigating the content.</li>
  <li>Services that consume events from streams to construct features about different entities. For example, we have a system that consumes events that occur when chat messages are sent and received, and can then serve requests for features about conversations (e.g., the number of turns).</li>
</ol>

<p>What this means is that data across our keyspaces is typically organised around the systems that they serve: we design a system first (e.g., a system for user accounts), and the features it holds follows from that design (data about user accounts).</p>

<h2 id="-whats-different-about-feature-stores">🧐 What’s different about “feature stores?”</h2>

<p>The idea of a feature store is different because it is a system that is meant to prospectively hold a <em>wide diversity</em> of data–nearly anything that could be valuable input to machine learning models. The “features” could even be the output of <em>other</em> machine learning models (predictions or embeddings).</p>

<p>I think this is an important point because this inverts how data is organised in a production system. With a feature store, you can build a separation of concerns between the systems that generate data and the aggregations of that data that are input into ML models. If you want stats about user accounts, you no longer need to know about user account system– you <em>just</em> query the feature store.</p>

<p>The main reason that is often stated for having a centralised place for features is that they are <em>meant to be reused</em> to solve different problems. For example, let’s say that I’m building a feature, like “average number of transactions in the last 7 days.” This feature could potentially be very useful to a whole host of <em>different</em> machine learning models. If we were going to store this data inside of the system that uses it, we may end up:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having to rebuild the same feature in more than one place, and</li>
  <li>Making it very difficult to discover what features are available for reuse across problems.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="-pause-do-these-two-problems-actually-matter">⏸ Pause: do these two problems actually matter?</h3>

<p>Before I carry on to describe our feature store, I’ll pause to reiterate a word of warning that I mentioned in <a href="http://nlathia.github.io/2020/11/Why-ML-code.html">my last blog post</a>. Building something <em>twice</em> may, at first glance, sound like a waste of time. Folks pitching feature stores often tend to drive home that point. However, in some critical use cases, building something twice can help to validate the system’s correctness.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/danielchatfield">one of our Staff Engineers</a> told me, “the types of mistakes that you can make when writing SQL <em>are very different</em> from the types of mistakes you can make when writing Go.” Reimplementing a feature from SQL to Go provides us with two outputs which we can use for reconciliation: if both spit back the same number, we can be more confident the implementations are correct.</p>

<p>In short: the “only code things once” pitch doesn’t actually work for all use cases.</p>

<p>The second point, regarding discovering features for reuse across problems, is also contentious. You could imagine putting all of your features into a set of wide relational tables. At some point, centralising all of the data would come hand-in-hand with a loss of context about what that data means, and how it should be used. Once you have 1000s of features, a central list of them becomes difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>For example, if you had a feature that describes a user as <code>is_inactive</code>, what does that <em>actually</em> mean, and does that definition fit with the new use case?  How do you ensure that the feature store’s documentation for this remain lined up with the upstream system that is generating the raw data? How do you avoid ending up with multiple implementations of the same <em>concept</em>, expressed as variants of the same code, ad nauseam?</p>

<p>So the “discover all your features” is also a slightly trickier problem that “just put them all in one place.”</p>

<h2 id="-narrowing-down-the-problem-space">🔍 Narrowing down the problem space</h2>

<p>If you open up the website of your favourite company that is offering a feature store, it’s more than likely that they’ll have a list of five to ten (sometimes more!) problems that their feature store solves: integrations, data sources, consistency, monitoring, versioning, meta-data and documentation, training dataset creation, production serving, and so on.</p>

<p><em>It’s mind boggling.</em></p>

<p>Up front, I decided that I had no desire to migrate any of our existing systems to sit behind any kind of centralised “feature store” API. I didn’t want the feature store to become a replacement for things that already existed, or a behemoth that is owned by my (small) team. Instead, I learned about what we needed by looking for patterns in the machine learning models that we were shipping.</p>

<p>Specifically, we didn’t need a feature store until this year, when we ramped up how often we were designing and shipping machine learning models that were trained on tabular data (systems we built prior were very NLP-heavy).</p>

<p>When shipping tabular-based models, we kept finding that many of the features we would input into a model while training it were <em>not</em> readily available in our production infrastructure. A large part of this is because our <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/monzo">analytics stack</a>, where all of our Data Scientists and Analysts contribute, sits separately from our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/monzo/">production stack</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a toy example: a customer’s account balance, accurate to this specific moment, is already available in production–so doesn’t need to be in a feature store. <em>But</em> aggregations on a customer’s balance (e.g., a customer’s 7-day average balance) were not, even though these numbers were already available in our <em>analytics</em>, based on SQL queries that Data Scientists had previously written.</p>

<p>We found that we already had an abundance of features in our analytics tables that, if used in production, would specifically be characterised by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Having values that change “slowly.” These are different types of aggregations, like averages and counts, that we wanted to use, but specifically did not need them to be accurate up to the latest microsecond.</li>
  <li>Being easy to implement in BigQuery SQL, on our historical data, but would be harder (or, more simply, a lot of work) to rebuild and backfill in our production environment.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our problem, therefore, narrowed down to “we need a subset of the numbers, that only exist in our analytics, in production.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first couple of times that anyone in my team ran into this, we queried BigQuery directly from our services, and cached the results. Job done. Over time, the pattern started becoming clearer: we were bound to regularly need this <em>bridge</em> between BigQuery and Cassandra, and didn’t want to rebuild it every single time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This narrowed down the purpose and value-add for a building a feature store in our system: <em>enabling</em> the safe reuse of slow-changing features from our analytics, in production.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-our-analytics-feature-store">🏪 Our analytics feature store</h2>

<p>What we have today is a system that automates the journey of shipping features between our analytics (BigQuery) and production (Cassandra) databases.</p>

<p>The process starts with a Data Scientist writing some SQL, as they usually do. They tag it as a query that builds a feature table. These tables are automaticaly scheduled and generated alongside all of our other analytics tables, at varying frequencies (daily, hourly, etc.), using Airflow. We use <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>, and so each query will be written with <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/">tests</a>.</p>

<p>By design, feature tables must specificy a <code>subject_type</code> column. This defines the entity that the feature described, such as a “user” feature or a “sort code” feature. The table must also have a corresponding <code>subject_id</code>, which is the actual ID of the user for that row. The schema of this table is replicated in the feature store Go service, because we do not want it to “blindly” ingest data.</p>

<p>The creation of feature tables is monitored: a cron jobs regularly checks whether those tables should be sync’ed into Cassandra. A table should be sync’ed if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It has been recreated (compared to the last time it was sync’ed), and;</li>
  <li>It passes data validation tests (i.e., it doesn’t accidentally have garbage in it);</li>
</ul>

<p>When a table needs to be sync’ed, it gets partitioned into batches and then exported as line-delimited JSON into …</p></div></div>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<p>How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb?</p>



<p>It’s a dumb joke, and I’ll let you suffer through it. But first, let’s talk about relationships.</p>



<p>Every relationship is more than just two people. There is an unspoken middle ground called the <em>relationship system</em>, a constantly evolving construct defined by the interactions between two people. In other words: how I act influences you, and how you behave affects me. Relationship systems have a memory, and past events color how we see each other. A good relationship system can produce trust, shared experience, and so much more. And when people have problems with each other, it’s usually best to start looking at flaws in the relationship system before trying to find fault in either party.</p>



<p>How do you improve a relationship? You have some control over your own behaviors, a little control over the relationship system, and absolutely no control over the other person.</p>



<p>To strengthen relationships, it helps to understand what I call <em>the cardinal rule of mental health</em>: your only real option to improve any situation is to change your behavior. That doesn’t mean that everything is your fault. It’s an acknowledgment that you wait for something unexpected to happen, change your approach, or leave. But you’ll never, ever, be able to force real change in someone else. You can ask them for change, support them, antagonize them, or even cut them off. No one strategy works in every situation. And yet all reasonable options start and end with you.</p>



<p>I’m not trying to minimize the capacity for change in others. I am fundamentally optimistic about our capacity to improve, despite the very real forces of <a href="https://feelbetterlater.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-change/">ambivalence and habit</a>. There are reasons why we do what we do, and reasons we want to do better. A good therapist digs deep to uncover motivation, but they can’t build on something that isn’t there. It’s rare outside of therapy to have the permission, skill, and safety to probe others this way. Instead, you get to decide if you can tolerate what’s happening right now.</p>



<p>That is the textbook definition of a boundary: “you can’t do this to me and expect our relationship to continue as it is.” How do you enforce a boundary? By changing your part in the relationship. You don’t have the power to do anything else.</p>



<p>How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb? How many people does it take to have a positive influence? One. But some small part of the lightbulb has to want to change itself. You don’t have to spend the rest of your life clinging to lightbulbs that refuse to budge. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Sometimes people ask me what they should learn to become a better programmer. I feel like the default recommendation here is usually an obscure programming language or a textbook on some high-powered machinery like ML. So I always feel a little bit embarrassed and boring when I instead suggest going really deep on what you already know: your main programming language, web framework, object-relational mapper, UI library, version control system, database, Unix tools, etc. It’s not shiny or esoteric, but for me, building a detailed mental model of those (and how they compare to alternatives) might be the learning that’s contributed most to my effectiveness as an engineer.</p><p>A coworker coined the phrase “blub studies” to refer to this sort of mundane, ultra-specific-seeming knowledge. “Blub” comes from a Paul Graham essay, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>, in which Blub is a hypothetical middlebrow language whose programmers get defensive when Graham asserts that Lisp is superior. Blub studies is the study of what goes on in the guts of these boring, everyday systems—not the kind you get tenure for inventing, but the kind people actually use.</p><p>Blub studies is a never-ending treadmill of engineering know-how. It’s the fiddly technical details of how Git stores data, or how Postgres locking semantics <a href="https://gocardless.com/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-migrations-the-hard-parts/" target="_blank">caused your migration to bring down prod</a>, or why <code>pip install</code> failed <em>this</em> time. It’s what goes on inside the boiler rooms of your computer. There’s a seemingly infinite amount of it, full of bespoke details for you to stumble over, and that makes it, often, unbelievably frustrating. Experts in shiny fields like machine learning write shiny-sounding articles like <em><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/31/a-theory-of-the-learnable/" target="_blank">A theory of the learnable</a></em>; experts in blub studies emit screeds like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/" target="_blank">The Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> and <a href="https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks" target="_blank">Programming Sucks</a>.</p><p>In short, if you’re in search of generalizable knowledge that <a href="https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/" target="_blank">compounds exponentially over time</a>, then blub studies looks like the crap you have to wade through to get to the good stuff. So it’s easy to see why people give up on understanding all the blub they’re surrounded by, except what they need to get the job done.</p><p>But for me, the opposite attitude has been more productive. <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/" target="_blank">Computers can be understood</a>—even if it’s hard and takes a while. Blub studies is more generalizable than it seems, and has its own way of compounding over time, too. That makes it a lot more useful than you’d expect.<sup><label for="sn0">✻</label><span><span><sup>✻</sup>
Of course, there are useless parts of blub studies: if this essay gets you excited to memorize a bunch of command-line flags, consider <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/" target="_blank">reversing this advice</a>. But in my experience, it’s more common to neglect the useful parts of blubs, than to over-index on trivia.</span></span></sup></p><hr><p>The most straightforward benefit of blub expertise is that it saves you time. <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1305214228991750144" target="_blank">“You can’t apply those brilliant insights you learned from SICP if you don’t have the knowledge base and emotional fortitude to fight through <code>pip install</code> first."</a> If you know how Git’s internal model works, you can get your repository out of its borked state without spending hours on Stack Overflow.</p><p>This effect is larger than it might seem. If you’re working with a system you don’t understand, you’re limited to debugging via guess-and-check, which can be arbitrarily slow. A more efficient method would be to <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1265360282513281025?lang=en" target="_blank">get as much information as possible about your program’s execution</a> and then use that information to exclude most of the hypothesis space. But this requires a good understanding of both the system, and the tools available for inspecting it. If you’re tracking down, say, a networking problem, staring at some <code>tcpdump</code> output will often get you most of the way there, but only if you know how to interpret it and what to look for.</p><p>If you spend half your programming time debugging, and being a blub expert lets you debug twice as fast, then just the speed gain from blub expertise will let you increase your output by a third.<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
If you think “half of programming time debugging” sounds high, imagine how much faster you’d be if all your code worked the first time.<p>Doubling debugging speed is probably a conservative estimate—you can save pretty much unlimited time via things like <a href="http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/10/14/lag/" target="_blank">“hmm, 40 milliseconds sounds like the timeout for Nagle’s algorithm, try setting <code>TCP_NODELAY</code>”</a>. I somewhat frequently debug tricky things 5x+ faster than coworkers, just because I’ve been working with our stack for a long time, so I know where to look for problems and how to quickly test hypotheses.</p></span></span></sup> That justifies a lot of time staring at <code>tcpdump</code> output! But there are also more subtle reasons I’ve gotten so much from blub studies. It’s both more general, lasts longer, and has more of a compounding effect, than I expected.</p><hr><p>Blub studies are surprisingly broadly applicable because, even if you’re learning about the details of some specific blubby system, that system’s design will contain a juicy non-blubby core of extractible general principles. Unlike many “general principles” people try to teach you, the ones you learn via blub studies are guaranteed to be important to at least one real-world system (the one you’re learning about). And you’ll see them realized in all their messy detail, which academic presentations often leave out.</p><p>Suppose your blub of choice is React. You might worry that learning the gory details will be useless if you ever move to a different part of the stack, or even a different web framework. And, yes, some of them will. But the core idea of React—writing pure render functions, using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html" target="_blank">reconciliation</a> to make updates fast—is extremely powerful and general. In fact, it’s now been copied by the next generation of UI frameworks on both iOS (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" target="_blank">SwiftUI</a>) and Android (<a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose" target="_blank">Jetpack Compose</a>). Learning the principles behind React makes it easier to learn those other frameworks. In fact, it can even be a useful source of ideas to “import” from one to the other. At Wave, for instance, we’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of importing ideas from <a href="https://relay.dev/" target="_blank">Relay</a> into our mobile apps.</p><p>This is a good example of an idea that, as far as I know, you can <em>only</em> learn about through blub studies. Academia didn’t give much attention to React-style UI programming. In fact, it doesn’t seem to view user-interface programming paradigms as a particularly interesting object of study at all. People do sometimes publish on it but, for instance, I couldn’t find any courses on it in MIT’s extensive course catalog.<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
You could argue that this is because UI programming is “too applied” and one shouldn’t expect it to be covered in an academic curriculum. But computer science covers many other equally-“applied” areas, like networking, databases, operating systems, and graphics.</span></span></sup></p><hr><p>Blub studies also compound more than you’d naively expect, in two ways. First, knowing about one blub makes it easier to learn about alternative blubs that serve the same purpose—like the React/SwiftUI example above. Second, knowing more about one blub helps you learn blubs in <em>adjacent</em> parts of the stack more quickly.</p><p>Once, while pair programming with a more junior coworker, we were writing a complicated SQLAlchemy query. My coworker used <code>user.name</code> (the <code>name</code> field of an object stored in the <code>user</code> variable) instead of <code>User.name</code> (the <code>name</code> field of the <em>class</em> <code>User</code>) and was wondering why her query gave the wrong results. I tried to explain the “magic” by which <code>User.name</code> was an instance of <code>Column</code> while <code>user.name</code> was a simple <code>str</code>. I went around in circles for a little while until I eventually explained Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" target="_blank">descriptor protocol</a> to her (the language feature SQLAlchemy uses to enable the “declarative” ORM syntax). At that point, everything clicked—and I realized that Python’s <code>__dunder__</code> methods are the key to decoding quite a lot of “magical” seeming code. If you learn the Python language features well, lots of complicated libraries will become a lot easier to understand.</p><p>I had a similar experience myself with Kubernetes. The first time I tried to learn it, it was a bewildering morass of jargon—all those namespaces and containers and Pods and Deployments and Services and Ingresses just to get a simple HTTP server running! Then I read <a href="http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/" target="_blank">a networking textbook</a> and everything made much more sense. The (arguably) most complicated parts of Kubernetes exist to solve networking-related problems—allowing hundreds of containers to talk to each other independently while hosted on a much smaller set of computers—so the networking textbook gave me a schema onto which I could hang all my Kubernetes factoids. Once I knew how Linux’s IP routing, iptables, and network namespaces worked, it was much easier for me to understand what exactly something like “kube-proxy” was doing.</p><p>If you know enough different blubs, you can end up at the point where you don’t even need to look things up to figure out how they’re (probably) implemented. An experienced Python programmer can guess immediately how SQLAlchemy’s “declarative” ORM works under the hood. That’s the point when your blub expertise will really start compounding—almost as soon as you start working with something new, you’ll start figuring out how it works and extracting the kernel of generally-interesting ideas.</p><hr><p>Because of this compounding effect, the most important step toward becoming a blub master is to kickstart your “blub flywheel”—the virtuous cycle of blub accumulation—however you can. That means starting with whichever blubs are the easiest or most motivating to learn, and branching out from there. For me, the easiest place to start has been with blubs I’m already using at my day job. I have a couple strategies for getting the most out of those.</p><p>First, I’ll try to <em>go deeper than necessary</em>. If I really want to ship something, it’s easy to give into temptation to, say, Google an error message, copy-paste a fix from Stack Overflow, and move on with my day. But it often doesn’t take that much longer to actually read the error message, understand what it means, and try to figure out <em>why</em> that Stack Overflow answer fixed my problem. Similarly, if I’m stuck in a tricky yak shave, I’ll bias against “guess-and-check” style …</p></article></div>

<p>It was in the ’90s and shareware was still cool. I had written a couple of small shareware programs and I was worried about bugs related to dates and times.</p>

<p>So I wrote a new program called DateDesist.</p>

<p>DateDesist allowed me to test how my program would behave on specific dates. It was a fairly simple command line program. What it did was change the date on the machine, execute the program to be tested, wait a few seconds, then restore the date and exit.</p>

<p>It worked incredibly well for testing date-based shareware and making sure that programs expired when they were intended to.</p>

<p>I found it useful for my own testing and wanted to release it for other developers. So I package it up and released it on a bunch of shareware sites such as Tucows, SoftSeek and Freeware Home.</p>

<p>Sometime later I went looking for a <em>crack</em> for a piece of software that I was having trouble getting. I pulled up HotBot (my preferred search engine at the time) and quickly found what I was looking for. I downloaded the archive and took a look at the files inside.</p>

<p>There, I found the typical readme file with a short description of the program it was intended to crack and some ASCII art with the name of the cracking crew. Also included was a copy of my original DateDesist executable and a batch file to launch the target program on a specific date.</p>

<p>Now curious, I searched the web again for other cracks made by the same crew. To my surprise DateDesist had been used in dozens, maybe hundreds, of different cracks that were released by this group. I checked other cracks from other groups on the same sites and found DateDesist used in a significant number of them.</p>

<![CDATA[Running Erlang Releases Without EPMD on OTP 23.1]]>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <div>
        <p>Erlang/OTP deployments that want to provide shell access or cluster nodes relied
on something called the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD), a separate process
that handled all distribution mechanisms. Previous attempts at working around
this requirement used third party dependencies such as
<a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdless">epmdless</a> and required specific
configuration arguments to the VM to setup. This was not ideal and was easy to
get wrong.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.erlang.org/news/141">Erlang/OTP 23.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erlware/relx/releases/tag/v4.2.0">relx 4.2</a> (included in <a href="https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/">Rebar3 3.14.3</a>) it is now possible
to conveniently run Erlang releases without relying on EPMD for opening a
remote shell or clustering nodes. This is particularly going to make Erlang releases
simpler to configure in locked down environments, and easier to use with containers.</p>
<p>EPMD is a separate process that is started, if
not already running, when an Erlang node boots with distribution enabled –
meaning <code>-sname</code> or <code>-name</code> is passed to the boot command. The new node <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html#epmd-protocol">talks to
the EPMD process</a> to register its name with a port that the node will also bind
to. When a node wants to connect to another one it must look up the port the other
node is listening on through EPMD. This is required both for
clustering nodes together and connecting a remote shell on the command line –
which is essentially the same as clustering because a new node is started before
attaching to the remote node to bring up a shell on that node.</p>
<p>Bypassing EPMD has been made possible through a couple new options added to <code>erl</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/c21bbb6136a1f4d343c3cf53476107e78221a68f"><code>-erl_epmd_port P</code></a>: Configures the port this node will listen on and use when
connecting to remote nodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/7a7c90be0e87cb3b4920de5aaf215c4b9cebcb30"><code>-dist_listen false</code></a>:
Setting this keeps the node from binding to the port, preventing it from
acting as a server, and instead uses the port only for connecting to remote
nodes. The use case for this is when opening a remote shell <code>-remsh &lt;node&gt;</code>
(<code>remote_console</code> in the release script) to a local node.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/61b1ad3c57f4e92fb9b55f97b9ffd9dee80067e2"><code>-[s]name undefined</code></a>:
Passing <code>undefined</code> for the short or long name of a node generates a unique node
name and sets additional flags, <code>-dist_listen false -hidden -dist_auto_connect never</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An extra option has also been added to <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_call.html"><code>erl_call</code></a> :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/ce4fcf0640d81a268c15af339a888406b757ced5"><code>-address P</code></a>:
Sets the address and/or port to connect to the running Erlang node. This
removes the need to look up the remote node or to even specify its name when
running <code>erl_call</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/3a57ed212befae5d0e03569408849e8a72122911"><code>-R</code></a>: Tells <code>erl_call</code> to use a dynamic random name for the hidden node it starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of OTP 23.1+ the <code>relx</code> generated release script uses <code>erl_call</code> instead of
the custom <code>escript</code> <code>nodetool</code> when the commands <code>rpc</code> and <code>eval</code> are used to
run code on a running node.</p>
<p>These options are used automatically by the release shell script when starting a
node, opening a remote shell or interacting with the running node through <code>rpc</code>
and <code>eval</code>. The only change you as a user must make to run your release without
<code>epmd</code> is to set the OS environment variable <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> is set in the environment the option to not start EPMD
(<code>-start_epmd false</code>) is added to the <code>erl</code> arguments automatically, along with
<code>-erl_epmd_port ${ERL_DIST_PORT}</code>. The <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> is also used by
<code>erl_call</code> with <code>-address ${ERL_DIST_PORT}</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdlessless">epmdlessless</a> is an example project
that comes with a
<a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdlessless/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a>
setup that makes it simple to play with these new features. Note that no changes are
required to <code>vm.args.src</code> to disable EPMD or set a port to use, the only
configuration done is through the environment variable <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> in
<code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    ...
    environment:
      - ERL_DIST_PORT=8001
    ...
</code></pre><p>Note that each node must listen on the same port because setting
<code>-erl_epmd_port P</code> tells Erlang both what port to listen on and what port to use
when connecting to other nodes.</p>
<p>After cloning the repo, build the Docker image and start 3 nodes (<code>node_a</code>, <code>node_b</code>, <code>node_c</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre><p>Then, use <code>docker exec</code> to open a remote shell on <code>node_a</code> and connect to
<code>node_b</code> (be sure to disconnect from the remote shell with <code>Ctrl-g</code> followed by
<code>q</code>, if you use <code>q().</code> it will shutdown the remote node):</p>
<pre><code>$ docker exec -ti node_a bin/epmdlessless remote_console

epmd: Cannot connect to local epmd
</code></pre><h2 id="separate-ports-where-epmdless-is-still-needed">Separate Ports: Where epmdless is Still Needed</h2>
<p>It is important to note that this requires every node to listen on the same
port, which requires every node to have its own IP. If this isn’t an option, or
for whatever reason you need to use separate ports for nodes, then <a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdless">epmdless</a>
is an option to replace EPMD and track the node to port mapping. But if you are
running with containers in an environment like Kubernetes you can now keep EPMD
from running in each container by simply upgrading Erlang and Rebar3, and
setting the <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>Security researchers are alarmed: the already-notorious Trickbot malware has been spotted probing infected computers to find out which version of UEFI they're running. This is read as evidence that Trickbot has figured out how to pull off a really scary feat.</p>
<p>To understand why, you have to understand UEFI: a fascinating, deep, philosophical change to our view of computers, trust, and the knowability of the universe. It's a tale of hard choices, paternalism, and the race to secure the digital realm as it merges with the physical.</p>
<p>Computers were once standalone: a central processing unit that might be augmented by some co-processors for specialized processes, like a graphics card or even a math co-processor.</p>
<p>These co-pros were subordinate to the CPU though. You'd turn on the computer and it would read a very small set of hardcoded instructions telling it how to access a floppy disk or other storage medium for the rest of the boot sequence, the stuff needed to boot the system.</p>
<p>The hardwired instructions were in a ROM that had one job: wake up and feed some instructions to the "computer" telling it what to do, then go back to sleep. But there's a philosophical conundrum here.</p>
<p>Because the world of computing is adversarial and networked computing is doubly so: there are people who want your computer to do things that are antithetical to your interests, like steal your data or spy on you or encrypt all your files and demand ransom.</p>
<p>To stop this, you need to be able to examine the programs running on your computer and terminate the malicious ones. And therein lies the rub: when you instruct your computer to examine its own workings, how do you know if you can trust it?</p>
<p>In 1983, Ken Thompson (co-creator of C, Unix, etc) was awarded a Turing Award ("computer science's Nobel Prize"). He gave a fucking bombshell of an acceptance speech, called "Reflections on Trusting Trust."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf</a></p>
<p>Thompson revealed that he had created a backdoor for himself that didn't just live in Unix, but in the C compiler that people made to create new Unix systems.</p>
<p>Here's what that means: when you write a program, you produce "high-level code" with instructions like "printf("Hello, World!");". Once your program is done, you turn it into machine code, a series of much shorter instructions that your CPU understands ("mov  dx, msg" etc).</p>
<p>Most programmers can't read this machine code, and even for those who can, it's a hard slog. In general, we write our code, compile it and run it, but we don't examine it. With nontrivial programs, looking at the machine code is very, very hard.</p>
<p>Compilers are treated as intrinsically trustworthy. Give 'em some source, they spit out a binary, you run the binary. Sometimes there are compiler bugs, sure, and compiler improvements can be a big deal. But compilers are infrastructure: inscrutable and forgotten.</p>
<p>Here's what Thompson did: he hid a program in his compiler that would check to see whether you were compiling an operating system or a compiler. If you were compiling an OS, it hid a secret login for him inside of it.</p>
<p>If you were compiling a compiler, it hid the program that looked for compilers or operating systems inside of it.</p>
<p>Think about what this means: every OS you compiled had an intentional security defect that the OS itself couldn't detect.</p>
<p>If you suspected that your compiler was up to no good and wrote your own compiler, it would be compromised as soon as you compiled it. What Thompson did was ask us to contemplate what we meant when we "trusted" something.</p>
<p>It was a move straight out of Rene Descartes, the reasoning that leads up to "I think therefore I am." Descartes' "Discourse on the Method" asks how we can know things about the universe.</p>
<p>He points out that sometimes he thinks he senses something but is wrong – he dreams, he hallucinates, he misapprehends.</p>
<p>If all our reasoning depends on the impressions we get from our senses, and if our senses are sometimes faulty, how can we reason at all?</p>
<p>Descartes wants a point of certainty, one thing he <em>knows</em> to be absolutely true. He makes the case that if you can be certain of one thing, you can anchor everything else to this point and build up a massive edifice of trustable knowledge that all hangs off of this anchor.</p>
<p>Thompson is basically saying, "You thought you had descartesed your way into a trustable computing universe because of the axiom that I would never poison your lowest-level, most fundamental tools.</p>
<p>"<em>Wrong</em>.</p>
<p>"Bwahahahaha."</p>
<p>(But, you know, in a nice way: an object lesson to serve as a wake-up call before computers fully merged with the physical world to form a global, species-wide digital nervous system whose untrustworthy low-level parts were foolishly, implicitly trusted).</p>
<p>But processors were expensive and computers were exploding. PCs running consumer operating systems like Windows and Mac OS (and more exotic ones like GNU/Linux and various Unices) proliferated, and they all shared this flawed security model.</p>
<p>They all relied on the operating system to be a faithful reporter of the computer's internals, and operated on the assumption that they could use programs supervised by the OS to detect and terminate malicious programs.</p>
<p>But starting in 1999, Ken Thompson's revenge was visited upon the computing world. Greg Hoglund released Ntrootkit, a proof-of-concept malware that attacked Windows itself, so that the operating system would lie to antivirus programs about what it was doing and seeing.</p>
<p>In Decartesspeak, your computer could no longer trust its senses, so it could no longer reason. The nub of trust, the piton driven into the mountainface, was made insecure and the whole thing collapsed. Security researchers at big companies like Microsoft took this to heart.</p>
<p>In 2002, Peter Biddle and his team from Microsoft came to EFF to show us a new model for computing: "Trusted Computing" (codenamed "Palladium").</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020805211111/https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/0724palladiumwp.asp">https://web.archive.org/web/20020805211111/https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/0724palladiumwp.asp</a></p>
<p>Palladium proposed to give computers back their nub of Descartesian certainty. It would use a co-processor, but unlike a graphics card or a math co-pro, it would run before the CPU woke up and did its thing.</p>
<p>And unlike a ROM, it wouldn't just load up the boot sequence and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>This chip – today called a "Secure Enclave" or a "Trusted Platform Module" (etc) – would have real computing power, and it would remain available to the CPU at all times.</p>
<p>Inside the chip was a bunch of cool cryptographic stuff that provided the nub of certainty. At the start of the boot, the TPM would pull the first stages of the boot-code off of the drive, along with a cryptographic signature.</p>
<p>A quick crypto aside:</p>
<p>Crypto is code that mixes a key (a secret known to the user) with text to produce a scrambled text (a "ciphertext") that can only be descrambled by the key.</p>
<p>Dual-key crypto has two keys. What one scrambles, the other descrambles (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>With dual-key crypto, you keep one key secret (the "private key") and you publish the other one (the "public key"). If you scramble something with a private key, then anyone can descramble it with your public key and know it came from you.</p>
<p>If you scramble it <em>twice</em>, first with your private key and then with your friend's public key, then they can tell it came from you (because only your private key's ciphertexts can be descrambled with your public key).</p>
<p>And <em>you</em> can be certain that only they can read it (because only their private key can descramble messages that were scrambled with their public key).</p>
<p>Code-signing uses dual-key crypto to validate who published some code.</p>
<p>Microsoft can make a shorter version of its code (like a fingerprint) and then you scramble it with its private key. The OS that came with your computer has a copy of MSFT's public key. When you get an OS update, you can descramble the fingerprint with that built-in key.</p>
<p>If it matches the update, then you know that Microsoft signed it and it hasn't been tampered with on its way to you. If you trust Microsoft, you can run the update.</p>
<p>But…What if a virus replaces Microsoft's public keys with its own?</p>
<p>That's where Palladium's TPM comes in. It's got the keys hardcoded into it. Programs running on the CPU can only ask the TPM to do very limited things like ask it to sign some text, or to check the signature on some text.</p>
<p>It's a kind of god-chip, running below the most privileged level of user-accessible operations. By design, you – the owner of the computer – can demand things of it that it is technically capable of doing, and it can refuse you, and you can't override it.</p>
<p>That way, programs running even in the most privileged mode can't compromise it.</p>
<p>Back to our boot sequence: the TPM fetches some startup code from the disk along with a signature, and checks to see whether the OS has been signed by its manufacturer.</p>
<p>If not, it halts and shows you a scary error message. Game over, Ken Thompson!</p>
<p>It is a very cool idea, but it's also very scary, because the chip doesn't take orders from Descartes' omnibenevolent God.</p>
<p>It takes orders from Microsoft, a rapacious monopolist with a history of complicity with human rights abuses. Right from that very first meeting the brilliant EFF technologist Seth Schoen spotted this (and made the Descartes comparison):</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021004125515/http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-07-05.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20021004125515/http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-07-05.html</a></p>
<p>Seth identified a way of having your cake and eating it too: he proposed a hypothetical thing called an "owner override" – a physical switch that, when depressed, could be used to change which public keys lived in the chip.</p>
<p>This would allow owners …</p></div></article></div>

It all started when a college friend told me about a cool program for typesetting
papers. Now typography books litter my apartment and I can't read a menu

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

        The Note is a gap analysis document.
        It identifieds the next steps
        for enabling
        Wide Color Gamut (WCG)
        and
        High Dynamic Range (HDR)
        on the Open Web Platform.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The initial commercial application of Color Science
        (principally colorimetry, rather than color appearance modelling)
        to the reproduction of color
        was concerned with surface colors
        such as painted or printed objects,
        lit by a single illuminant.
        The achievable luminance range was thus constrained
        to the luminance of a perfect diffuse reflector
        (practically, an unprinted sheet of good paper)
        at the high end,
        and the densest printed or painted black
        that could be achieved without the paper tearing or deforming,
        at the darkest end. This produced luminance ranges
        from as low as 20:1
        to as high as 90:1 (Fairchild, p.399 [[Fairchild-CAM]]).
        The achievable Chroma range was also limited
        by the vibrancy of mass-produced paints and inks,
        and the prohibitive cost of using additional spot colors
        to extend the gamut.
        <!-- add UCS diagram of coated and uncoated FOGRA21 and 39 -->
        Self-luminous displays, in that commercial environment,
        were primarily used at low luminances
        for soft proofing of an eventual printed product,
        and were intended to replicate the appearance of a viewing booth.
      </p>

      <p>Over time, self-luminous displays were seen
        as a worthy color management target in their own right:
        for computer displays,
        for the display of digital photography,
        for digital cinema,
        and for the consumption of media such as television and movies in the home.
        The luminance range increased:
        media consumed in near-dark environments such as the cinema
        could have much deeper blacks,
        while media consumed in dim to normal viewing environments
        enjoyed an increased peak white luminance of 200 to 300 cd/m².
        The darkest blacks in such environments were constrained by viewing flare,
        which is why the sRGB standard mandated a viewing flare of 5%,
        typical for glossy glass CRT displays of the time;
        coupled with a peak luminance of only 80cd/m²
        the luminance range was still relatively modest.
        The introduction of matt LCD and OLED screens,
        and the commercial success of HDTV, increased the dynamic range somewhat,
        but it was still comfortable encoded in 8 bits per gamma-corrected component.
        This is referred to as <b>Standard Dynamic Range (SDR)</b>.
        The achievable Chroma range for sRGB and Rec.709 HDTV, although extending beyond that of printed material at the primaries, was also relatively modest.
        Wider gamut displays were available professionally,
        covering most of the Adobe 1998 RGB™ colorspace,
        but wre typically not found in a home or office environment.
        <!-- sRGB gamut on UCS diagram -->
      </p>

      Commercial availability of displays covering the Display P3 gamut
      (a derivative of DCI P3 used for digital cinema,
      but altered to account for a non-dark viewing environment,
      with an sRGB transfer curve ,and D65 white point)
      meant that <b>Wide Color Gamut (WCG)</b> displays became commonplace
      on laptops, external monitors, mobile phones, and even watches.
      WCG requires a modest increase in the
      number of bits per gamma-corrected component,
      from 8 to 10 or 12 (for the widest gamut
      in common use for content delivery,
      Rec.2020).

      <p>The deployment of 4k and then 8k television,
      accompanied by digital content delivery,
      brought not only a similarly increased color gamut
      to the media space, but also a greatly increased dynamic range
      of 4000:1 or more.
      Increased phosphor efficiency and purity,
      together with bright and modulatable backlights,
      brought <b>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</b> into widespread use.
      Computers, however, remained limited to SDR for the most part.</p>

      <p>
        The human visual system can,
        with appropriate adaptation,
        function over an enormous luminance range —
        from starlight or moonlight at 0.01 cd/m² and  0.1 cd/m²,
        through the dim lighting at dawn and dusk (10 cd/m²),
        office lighting (100 cd/m²),
        modern displays (800 cd/m²),
        overcast daylight (1,000 cd/m²),
        bright daylight (10,000 cd/m²)
        and full direct sunlight (100,000 cd/m²).
        However, the full range cannot be simultaneously percieved
        in the same scene
        at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main
        systems defined for HDR video:
        Hyprid Log Gamma (HLG), developed by BBC and NHK, and
        Dolby Perceptual Quantizer (PQ).
        While improvement in video quality has driven the innovation of HDR,
        support for content on the web more generally, e.g., for static images,
        the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, and in CSS in general, is still
        needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a brief description of PQ and HLG approaches, including: use of
        metadata, absolute vs relative brightness, proprietary vs open standard,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BBC has published a frequently-asked questions document
        [[hdr-hlg-faq]] that gives a high level introduction to HDR, and the
        PQ and HLG solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fredrik Hubinette from Google has written a useful document
        [[hdr-chrome]] that discusses the issues with presenting, and in
        particular compositing, SDR and HDR content. This was presented at
        TPAC 2017. It considers both PQ and HLG. (<a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/11/07-colorweb-minutes.html">minutes
          of the TPAC 2017 meeting</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        On the web, SDR, and HDR content using both HLG and PQ is expected to
        coexist, potentially within the same page, as authors can include
        arbitrary content in their web pages. An example is a page that contains
        multiple embedded videos, or their poster images. This raises the
        question of how to composite content with different color spaces and
        dynamic range encodings.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Support for HDR and WCG on the web is important to allow color and
        luminance matching between HDR video content and surrounding or
        overlaid graphic and textual content in web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some specific goals include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure support for HDR encoded video as a first class citizen on the
          web, including both HLG and PQ, with appropriate rules defined for
          composition of content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable support for HDR static images, texual content, and graphics
          rendered via Canvas or SVG.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote understanding of HDR graphics issues among the web developer
          community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are a number of specifications potentially impacted by HDR.
        One of the purposes of this document is to identify all documents that
        are possibly affected, so that we can review them and determine any
        changes needed.

      <h2>Specifying Colors in Web Pages</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>CSS Color Module</h3>
        <p>
          CSS defines several ways of specifying the colors to use in web
          pages, in the CSS Color Module specifications. The current Recommendation is
          Level 3 [[css-color-3]], and its successor, Level 4, is becoming stable
          and starting to be implemented [[css-color-4]].
          The various methods in Level 4 cover WCG but not HDR, and are:

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{m-1,0}B &amp; A_{m-1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} 
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    (A_{0,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,0}B)^{\dagger} \\
    (A_{0,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,1}B)^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    (A_{0,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \overline{A_{0,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{0,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    A_{1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{n-1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{n-1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1,m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=
A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\]

</p><p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) &amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)^{\dagger} (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | x \rangle^{\dagger}) (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger}|\phi\rangle) \otimes (| x \rangle^{\dagger}|x\rangle) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle x | x \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes 1\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= \langle x, y \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Using the definition of inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= (Uy)^{\dagger} (Ux) \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}U^{\dagger} U x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}(U^{\dagger} U) x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} I x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;= \langle x, y \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the â€œvacantâ€� system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that â€œcopyingâ€� any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such â€œcopyâ€� operator, the mathematical expression for â€œcopyâ€� will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum â€œcopyâ€� operator that makes â€œcopyâ€� of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

      <p>C and C++ as languages have a few things separating them from each other, mostly in their minute details and, occasionally, larger feature sets like designated initializers. But there is a disturbingly high amount of C++ that can simply do C’s job far better than C<!--more-->, including when it comes to solving some of the biggest problems facing the evolution of C and C++.</p>

<p>Let’s take a contemporary problem plaguing both C and C++, affecting everyone from standard library maintainers to project developers, that has been going on for the last 20 or so years: <code>intmax_t</code>.</p>



<p>The concept behind <code>intmax_t</code> is simple enough: it is the largest integer type that your implementation and its standard library support in conjunction. Here is a few things <code>intmax_t</code> controls inside the implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>numeric literals are preprocessed according to what <code>intmax_t</code> can handle (C and C++);</li>
  <li>it is the maximum number of bits that can be printed portably, e.g. with <code>printf("%j", (intmax_t)value)</code> (C and C++);</li>
  <li><code>intmax_t</code> is the largest type for which <code>std::numeric_limits</code> applies, including most types up to and including that type (C++ only);</li>
  <li><code>intmax_t</code> underpins <code>std::chrono</code>’s casts and similar (e.g. no information is lost during conversions out of and into the system) (C++ only);</li>
  <li>and, there are a set of integer operations provided by the standard library (like absolute value and quotient / remainder operations) that can be done with the maximum bit precision available to the implementation (C and C++).</li>
</ul>

<p>These properties forge the basis of <code>intmax_t</code>’s purpose. Lossless storage, pass-through operations, and more can all be achieved by relying on this implicit contract of the type. Since it is a type definition, the “real” integer type underneath it can be swapped out and people relying on it can be upgraded seamlessly!</p>



<p>We cannot upgrade seamlessly.</p>

<p>C has a much higher commitment to not breaking old code and keeping “developers close to the machine”. What this actually translates to for most Application Binary Interfaces is very simplistic “name mangling” schemes (i.e., none), <a href="https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/status/1329960075096694790">weak linkers</a>, and other shenanigans. The end result is that we expose C developers to platform details that become invisible dependencies for their code that must be preserved at all costs. For example, let’s take a C Standard function that uses <code>intmax_t</code>, <code>imaxabs</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>intmax_t</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span> <span>j</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, let’s try to figure out how we can upgrade someone off of this usage without breaking their code too badly. We will try fixing this in both C and C++.</p>



<p>Taking <code>intmax_t</code>, let’s do a no-brainer usage case: calling a function with <code>intmax_t</code> input and return types. The syntax and usage ends up looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>original</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>val</span> <span>=</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>original</span><span>);</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>val</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy enough! But, there’s also a hidden dependency here, based on how the code is compiled. While many people compile their C standard library as a static library and only generate final binary code for what they use as to have a “self-contained” binary, the vast majority of the shared ecosystem depends on shared libraries/dynamically linked libraries for the standard. This means that when a program is milled through an operating system at program startup, the “loader” runs off to find the symbol <code>imaxabs</code> inside some system library (e.g., <code>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.27.so</code> for an “amd64” system). Harmless enough, right? Well, it turns out to be a bit of a problem in practice, because the name <code>imaxabs</code> is all that’s used in C to figure out what subroutine to talk with in some shared library,</p>

<p>and that name is completely inadequate.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The glibc maintainers decide they’re going to change from <code>long long</code> as their <code>intmax_t</code> and move to <code>__int256_t</code> for most platforms, because most platforms support it and they have a lot of customers asking for it.</li>
  <li>They upgrade the <code>libc</code> to its next version for various Linux distribution, and everyone links against it when they look for the default <code>libc</code>.</li>
  <li>You have an application. Your code was not changed or updated, so it was not recompiled. It calls <code>imaxabs</code>. The argument it passes is a <code>long long</code>, because that was the type at the time you last compiled and shipped your software.</li>
  <li>The <code>imaxabs</code> used to lookup the function to call finds the version that takes a <code>__int256_t</code> in the new <code>libc</code>.</li>
  <li>Different registers are used to pass and return the function value than expected by the <code>imaxabs</code> function call in the <code>libc</code> binary, because your application is in <code>long long</code> mode but glibc expects a <code>__int256_t</code>.</li>
  <li>All hell breaks loose.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is one of the manifestations of what is called an “Application Binary Interface (ABI) Break”. ABI Breaks are generally undetectable, silent breaks that occur within the runtime of a program that completely destroy any dependency your program has on that functionality for correctness. It typically happens when a subtle detail – the registers used to negotiate a large integral value between a shared library and its application, the amount of padding a structure might have on a certain build, the ordering and layout of class members, the interpretation of bits even if the layout or passing convention of a type never changes, and even more – changes.</p>

<h2 id="but-c-is-abi-stable">“But C Is ABI-Stable?!”</h2>

<p>Not necessarily. C is a simple language, and it both sells itself on and prides itself as such. So much so, that it’s even part of the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2021.htm">language’s rolling charter</a>. There’s barely any name mangling because there’s no overloading. If you want “virtual functions” you need to hand-craft your virtual table structure and initialize it yourself. There’s barely any lookup or entity negotiation: what you write – <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1328918322507706368">however scary or cursed</a> – is what you get, in a general sense. (No, it’s not “portable assembly”. Compilers tear C code apart and make it far more efficient than the code people stuff into it. It’s not even a direct model of the machine anymore: just an abstract one.)</p>

<p>Still, sometimes even C can’t get away from it. The function <code>imaxabs</code> relates to exactly one entity that, for historical reasons, was pinned to a function taking and returning a <code>long long</code>. Upgrading it means dealing with this schism between what the user expects (<code>intmax_t</code> that got upgraded and can print <code>__int128_t</code>/<code>__int256_t</code>) with old, non-recompiled code that maintains the old invariant (<code>long long</code>, a 64-bit number).</p>



<p>Okay, so symbols can be repurposed between library versions that lead to ABI breaks. What are the ways to defend against such a world, in C?</p>

<h2 id="macros">Macros?</h2>

<p>Macros! Object-like macros are fun. You could do something like this…</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define imaxabs __glibc228_imaxabs
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>… as a way to provide the <code>imaxabs</code> function. It is a bit like artisanal, hand-crafted, free-range, and organic ABI versioning (or, as I have affectionately come to call it: personal masochism to make up for language failures). This mostly works, until… it doesn’t!</p>

<h3 id="714">§7.1.4</h3>

<p>This is the “ABI Breaks Guaranteed” section in the C Standard. It’s real name is “§7.1.4 Use of library functions”. Reproduced below is the relevant piece that condemns us, emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any function declared in a header may be additionally implemented as a function-like macro defined in the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by such a macro. <strong>Any macro definition of a function can be suppressed locally by enclosing the name of the function in parentheses</strong>, because the name is then not followed by the left parenthesis that indicates expansion of a macro function name. For the same syntactic reason, it is permitted to take the address of a library function even if it is also defined as a macro. <strong>The use of <code>#undef</code> to remove any macro definition will also ensure that an actual function is referred to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only can a user suppress a function-like macro invocation by using the same trick used on <code>&lt;windows.h&gt;</code> like <code>(max)(value0, value1)</code>, but the C Standard Library permits them to also undefine function names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// implementer code: inttypes.h</span>
<span>#define imaxabs __glibc228_imaxabs
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// user code: main.c</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
</span>
<span>#undef imaxabs // awh geez
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>val</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>absval</span> <span>=</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>);</span> <span>// awH GEEZ</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>absval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mmm……</p>

<h3 id="implementation-specific-strategies">Implementation-specific strategies</h3>

<p>Alright, the C Standard basically loads a double barrel and brings our only standardized mitigation strategy out back behind the barn. What’s left? Well, implementation-specific insanity, that’s what:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extern</span>
<span>intmax_t</span>
<span>__glibc228_imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>__attribute</span><span>((</span><span>symbol</span><span>(</span><span>__MANGLE</span><span>(</span><span>__glibc228_imaxabs</span><span>))))</span>
<span>extern</span>
<span>intmax_t</span>
<span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pseudo-code. But, wouldn’t you believe it, some implementations actually do things very similar to this to get around these problems! The things they do are far more involved, like actually dropping down to the level of the linker and creating symbol maps and other exceedingly painful workarounds. The sed scripts and the awk scripts and the bash starts coming out, people are doing lots of text processing to get symbol names and match them to versioned symbol names…</p>

<p>It’s a mess.</p>

<p>Still, given the mess, it does save us from the problem. In C code you get to use “the real name” <code>imaxabs</code> as Our Lord and Savior intended, the binary gets linked to <code>___glibc228_imaxabs</code>, and everyone’s happy. There’s only one problem with this kind of fix…</p>

<p>It’s Quality of Implementation (QoI).</p>

<p>QoI is great for the pure, theoretical standard. We get to write sexy narratives in the C standard and call them “Recommended Practice”, with little footnotes furtively implying a more wonderful world while waggling our eyebrows seductively at hot, young developers in our area. Just come along, it’s going to be so great, we’re going have soooooo much fun, just go with that lovely little implementation right over there, you’re making such fine progress, enjoy yourself and come back soon my …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Being the internet-dabbling dilettante that I am, I often gaze longingly at the front page of Hacker News, wondering when my own content will reach it and <del>waste</del> merit the time of others. But alas, my time is precious, and I can't spend all day refreshing the browser to see when I've achieved my goal. Let's set something up to do that for me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mission:</em></strong> Write a script that scans the front page of HN for the presence of this blog post. If we detect it, update this blog post, including the time from when it reached the front page. Run the script(s) periodically for a day before accepting inevitable defeat.</p>

<h2><a href="#how-is-this-going-to-work">How is this going to work?</a></h2>
<p>Nothing fancy here - let's approach each of these steps individually before gluing them together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>go</code> script that scrapes the front page of HN for our post.</li>
<li>Create a <code>bash</code> script that calls the <code>go</code> script (and can tell whether it found our post or failed).</li>
<li>Create a periodically running job that runs the <code>bash</code> script.</li>
<li>
<p>Add conditional behaviors to the <code>bash</code> script:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script succeeds in finding our post: modify our post markdown (succeeded!), create a <code>git</code> commit, and push to <code>github</code> to trigger a deploy. Clear the job!</li>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script fails (and we're out of time): modify our post (failed), create a <code>git</code> commit, and push to <code>github</code> to trigger a deploy. Clear the job!</li>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script fails (and we have time left): log some information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy the blog post, submit it to HN, and start the script!</li>
<li>Keep my computer awake and return in 24 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can test the little pieces by handing the <code>go</code> script existing or fictional targets to search for on the front page of HN.</p>
<p>Sweet! Nothing to it but to do it. A few things to keep in mind before we start:</p>
<h4>High Level Caveats</h4>
<ol>
<li>I'm going to use <code>launchd</code> as my job scheduler because I'm working on a Mac. If you're on Linux, <span id="aside-os-scheduler" aside-content="Swapping in your own OS-specific scheduler is an exercise left to the reader! systemd is probably a reasonable place to start. 😇">you're going to need to use something else.<sup><a href="#aside-os-scheduler-note">1</a></sup></span></li>
<li>We will consider the "front page" to be anything in the top 30, since that's what loads on desktop before paginating. I may end up keeping track of "peak height reached", to salve my bruised ego - TBD.</li>
<li>We're going to run the script every 10 minutes for a day and then give up. Judging from the front page of HN <em>at this moment</em>, it looks like nothing is up there that's more than 24 hours old. If we don't reach the front page by then, we're fine with that.</li>
<li>We're going to write the results from running the script to a log file we can check later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although there are practical applications of periodically scraping websites and doing things with the data, this is obviously not one of them. Let's get to it.</p>

<h2><a href="#spinning-up-a-periodic-job">Spinning up a periodic job</a></h2>
<p>Half the fun of this is getting my computer to check regularly for me instead of pounding <code>cmd + r</code>. I initially looked into using <code>cron</code> and <code>crontab</code>, and saw the following when I ran <code>man crontab</code>:</p>
<div><p>...(Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands.  See launchctl(1) for more information.)</p></div>
<p>I figure that this is a quiet way of saying "might be deprecated soon" so I'm going to use the more contemporary set of tools (<code>launchd</code>) for our script.</p>
<p>How can we create a <code>launchd</code> job? I feel like I've done this in a past life, but I followed <a href="https://medium.com/@chetcorcos/a-simple-launchd-tutorial-9fecfcf2dbb3">this useful walkthrough</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/@chetcorcos">Chet Corcos</a> to refresh my memory. For <a href="https://www.launchd.info/">reference</a>:</p>
<div><p>(launchd is) a unified, open-source service management framework for starting, stopping and managing daemons, applications, processes, and scripts.</p></div>
<p>...and <code>launchctl</code> is the command line tool we can use to start and stop those processes. We're basically going to create an <code>XML</code> file describing when to run our job and how frequently, and add it to the set of jobs that my computer is already running periodically using <code>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/foo</code>. Unsurprisingly, we can unload the script with <code>launchctl unload ...</code>, referencing the same filepath.</p>
<p>Here's what my basic job looks like (<code>~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</code>):</p>

<p>Simple enough - the <code>XML</code> file is a set of key value pairs that define a script to run (<code>ProgramArguments</code>), a frequency to run at (<code>StartInterval</code>, measured in seconds), and some output paths and environment information (<code>WorkingDirectory</code>, <code>EnvironmentVariables</code>, etc.). Note that right now we've configured the job to run every 10 minutes, which we may want to tweak for debugging later. Also notice that the <span id="aside-directory-structure" aside-content="Obviously your directory structure might look completely different, so do what makes sense if you're following along at home.">working directory doesn't match<sup><a href="#aside-directory-structure-note">3</a></sup></span> the output paths I've referenced, and that I've moved the script to a separate directory too. I don't really want this code living in the repo for my blog, even though that's where we want to run the script (to possibly modify the markdown post and push with <code>git</code>).</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> ~/home</span></span>

</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>mv</span> guycombinator/navel.sh navel/</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nice. We've enabled <code>RunAtLoad</code>, so the script will run immediately. Let's see that everything still "works" by loading the job and checking <code>out.log</code> and <code>err.log</code>:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> ~/home/navel</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cat</span> out.log</span></span>
<span>Running navel.sh

</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>cat</span> err.log</span></span>
<span>/Users/scott/home/navel/navel.sh: line 6: go: command not found
/Users/scott/home/navel/navel.sh: line 6: go: command not found</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Aha - it doesn't look like the job knows how to run <code>go</code> commands. We need to make sure that the <code>&lt;EnvironmentVariables/&gt;</code> <code>ENV</code> value includes our <code>go</code> binary. Easy enough to fix:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>which</span> go</span></span>
<span>/Users/local/go/bin/go</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So lets add <em>the directory where</em> <code>go</code> <em>is located</em> (<code>/Users/local/go/bin</code>) to the end of our set of directories to look for executables (<code>PATH</code>) in the <code>plist</code> file:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code>...
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>EnvironmentVariables<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>dict</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>PATH<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>string</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;![CDATA[/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/go/bin]]&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>string</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>dict</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once more, with feeling:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span>launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>rm</span> err.log out.log</span></span>

<p>It takes a few seconds on my machine to fetch the results, we're waiting a bit with <code>sleep</code> before we check for results. But it worked! So let's add some slightly more complex behaviors based on the result of the script running.</p>

<h2><a href="#conditionalizing-the-bash-script">Conditionalizing the bash script</a></h2>
<p>Let's make sure it can do different things based on the execution of our script. To get the exit code back from a bash script, we can use the special variable <code>$?</code>.</p>

You will then pay back your investors over time via an income share agreement.</p><h3>About <strong>Income Share Agreements</strong></h3><p>An Income Share Agreement (ISA) allows for individuals to seek funding without requiring their investors to take a massive risk.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br>We found that many Friends and Family funding rounds and Pre-Seed funding rounds by startup founders happen when the business is still incredibly risky. With an incredibly high chance of failure, it is almost always a bad investment to make. At these early stages of a venture, the investors are usually investing based on their confidence in the founder more than any other factor. With that in mind, we believe it makes sense to provide founders with an investment vehicle that matches investors’ thought processes. That is where Income Share Agreements (ISAs) come into play. An ISA allows for investors to invest in a founder, with the potential to profit from the founder’s success. This means that an investor could profit if the founder is successful with their second or even third venture, instead of the investor’s money completely riding on the founder’s first venture.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>While this investment vehicle is not wiped out when an entity goes out of business, it also does not put a founder into long-term debt. There is no guarantee that a founder will pay back the entire amount of the initial investment, making the investment potentially more risky than a standard loan. But, since the investment does not go away with an entity, the investment is potentially less risky than an equity investment.<br>‍<br>We believe that ISAs are most useful when a startup founder needs capital to build their Minimum Viable Product, which is typically where a Friends and Family round happens.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>We also believe that ISAs are great alternatives to loans and are versatile to fit many different applications. From our research and customer development initiatives, we have found people who want to utilize ISAs for startup funding, working capital as a freelancer, student financing, debt refinancing or consolidation, and many other applications.&nbsp;</p><h2>ISA Examples</h2><p><strong>Basic Terms of an ISA</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Dollar amount of investment</p></li><li><p>Percentage of income each year</p></li><li><p>Max duration of income sharing</p></li><li><p>Capped pay-back amount</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example of an ISA and two scenarios</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You borrow $100k</p></li><li><p>Terms are 10% of income for 10 years, 3x pay-back cap</p></li></ul><p><em>Scenario 1</em></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You start making money from your business 2 years after getting funded through Invest In Me’s ISA.</p></li><li><p>You make $100k/yr for the next 5 years and then sell your business, making $10m from the sale.</p></li><li><p>You have paid back $50k from your annual income and $250k from the sale of your business, hitting the 3x cap on the ISA.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><em>Scenario 2</em></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You work on your business for 3 years, making no money. Your business fails and you decide to move on and get a job.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You make $60k/yr for the next 10 years. (Duration of the ISA is deferred while you were starting out and not earning anything.)</p></li><li><p>You have paid back $60k from your annual income and the ISA ends, leaving you debt-free.</p></li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>Other terms an ISA could contain</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Delay start of “duration” until first annual income over $40k happens</p></li><li><p>Years of under $40k income are exempt and deferred, extending the “duration”</p></li><li><p>Protections against stashing income in an S-corp to avoid paying on an ISA</p></li><li><p>Protections against taking a minimal income in order to “ride out” the term of the ISA before taking dividends from your business or selling it for a profit</p></li><li><p>No prepayment penalty, but also no prepayment discount on the capped pay-back.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Audit rights of personal tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements.</p></li></ul><h2>Why are we doing this?? 🤯</h2><div><p>Invest In Me is currently providing a way for startup founders to raise capital through an easier means. Our future will add to this and continue on our mission to increase people's access to capital.</p><p>Our intentions are to build a crowd-lending platform to allow for anyone to raise capital from the crowd via income share agreements.

In fairness, I feel like Xooglers get a bad rap. Since in my limited experience, I have noticed this to be just as true for folks from any other tech company - AirBnb, Uber, Stripe, or similar.</p><p>It’s not uncommon for humans to draw comparisons or use past learning to inform a future decision. It’s something I faced too after my time at Intercom. Then every time, I began a sentence with “At my place…” I mentally put a dollar in a jar while feeling a rush of cringe through my body. On the one hand, I felt horrible for not bringing a rational, unbiased mind to a conversation. On the other hand, I considered the comparison a useful thought experiment to tease out the details.</p><p>Drawing from a past experience, naming a company, technology, or referencing a white paper are also some ways of bringing credibility to the table while sharing an honest opinion. In fairness, I looked back to all kinds of experiences, especially the ones with lessons learnt.</p><p>The problem to avoid here is not to get into a rut of doing something just because that’s how X company or team operated in the past. Or because it makes the decision process more comfortable, so you patch the problem at hand and move on to the next things.</p><p>You may notice that often what is also being proposed is a solution that more or less addresses the problem. Still, folks get too involved in solutionizing, so they miss the sight of the original problem. Going back to first principles is a nice way to reset the ground. Asking questions like “Does this address the problem, we are facing here today?” or “What problem is it trying to solve?” can be helpful.</p><p>One thing to remember is not giving yourself a hard time. Its also why companies hire people with past experiences so you can bring that knowledge and expertise to help solve current problems.</p><p>A smart person once said, “The important thing is not to stop questioning”. And I think that’s what matters at the end of the day is to be able to innovate while being fair.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><p>At scale, any failure that can happen will eventually happen. Hardware failures, software crashes, memory leaks - you name it. The more components you have, the more failures you will experience.</p><p>This nasty behavior is caused by <em>cruel math</em> - given an operation that has a certain probability of failing, as the total number of operations performed increases, so does the total number of failures. In other words, as you scale out your application to handle more load, the more failures it will experience.</p><p>To protect your application against failures, you first need to know what can go wrong. Assuming you are using a cloud provider and not maintaning your own datacenter, the most common failures you will encounter are caused by single points of failure, the network being unreliable, slow processes, and unexpected load.</p><h2 id="single-point-of-failure"><a href="#single-point-of-failure" aria-label="single point of failure permalink"></a>Single Point of Failure</h2><p>A single point of failure is the most glaring cause of failure in a distributed system - it’s that one component that when it fails brings down the entire system with it. In practice, distributed systems can have multiple single points of failure.</p><p>A service that to start up needs to read its configuration from a non-replicated database is an example of a single point of failure - if the database isn’t reachable, the service won’t be able to start. </p><p>A more subtle example is a service that exposes a HTTP API on top of TLS and uses a certificate that needs to be manually renewed. If the certificate isn’t renewed by the time it expires, then most clients trying to connect to it wouldn’t be able to open a connection with the service. </p><p>Single points of failure should be identified when the system is architected before they can cause any harm. The best way to detect them is to examine every component of the system and ask what would happen if that component were to fail. Some single points of failure can be architected away, e.g., by introducing redundancy, while others can’t. In that case, the only option left is to minimize the blast radius.</p><h2 id="unreliable-network"><a href="#unreliable-network" aria-label="unreliable network permalink"></a>Unreliable Network</h2><p>When a client make a remote network call, it sends a request to a server and expects to receive a response from it a while later. In the best case, the client receives a response shortly after sending the request. But what if the client waits and waits and still doesn’t get a response? </p><p>In that case, the client doesn’t know whether a response will eventually arrive or not. At that point it has only two options, it can either continue to wait, or fail the request with an exception or an error.</p><p>Slow network calls are the <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/">silent killers</a> of distributed systems. Because the client doesn’t know whether the response is on its way or not, it can spend a long time waiting before giving up, if it gives up at all. The wait can in turn cause degradations that are extremely hard to debug. </p><h2 id="slow-processes"><a href="#slow-processes" aria-label="slow processes permalink"></a>Slow Processes</h2><p>From an observer’s point of view, a very slow process is not very different from one that isn’t running at all - neither can perform useful work. Resource leaks are one of the most common causes of slow processes.</p><p>Memory leaks are arguably the most well-known source of leaks. A memory leak manifests itself with a steady increase in memory consumption over time. Run-times with garbage collection don’t help much either - if a reference to an object that isn’t longer needed is kept somewhere, the object won’t be deleted by the garbage collector. </p><p>A memory leak keeps consuming memory until there is no more of it, at which point the operating system starts swapping memory pages to the disk constantly, all the while the garbage collector kicks in more frequently trying its best to release any shred of memory. The constant paging and the garbage collector eating up CPU cycles make the process slower. Eventually, when there is no more physical memory, and there is no more space in the swap file, the process won’t be able to allocate more memory, and most operations will fail.</p><p>Memory is just one of the many resources that can leak. For example, if you are using a thread pool, you can lose a thread when it blocks on a synchronous call that never returns. If a thread makes a synchronous, and blocking, HTTP call <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/">without setting a timeout</a>, and the call never returns, the thread won’t be returned to the pool. Since the pool has a fixed size and keeps losing threads, the pool will eventually run out of threads. </p><p>You might think that making <em>asynchronous</em> calls, rather than a synchronous ones, would mitigate the problem in the previous case. But, modern HTTP clients use socket pools to avoid recreating TCP connections and pay a <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/what-every-developer-should-know-about-tcp/">hefty performance fee</a>. If a request is made without a timeout, the connection is never returned to the pool. As the pool has a limited size, eventually there won’t be any connections left to communicate with the host.</p><p>On top of all that, the code you write isn’t the only one accessing memory, threads and sockets. The libraries your application depends on access the same resources, and they can do all kinds of shady things. Without digging into their implementation, assuming it’s open in the first place, you can’t be sure whether they can wreak havoc or not.</p><h2 id="unexpected-load"><a href="#unexpected-load" aria-label="unexpected load permalink"></a>Unexpected Load</h2><p>Every system has a limit to how much load it can withstand without scaling. Depending on how the load increases, you are bound to hit that brick wall sooner or later. But one thing is an organic increase in load, which gives you the time to scale your service out accordingly, and another is a sudden and unexpected spike.</p><p>For example, consider the number of requests received by a service in a period of time. The rate and the type of incoming requests can change over time, and sometimes suddenly, for a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li>The requests might have a seasonality - depending on the hour of the day the service is going to get hit by users in different countries.</li><li>Some requests are much more expensive than others and abuse the system in ways you didn’t really anticipate for, like scrapers slurping in data from your site at super human speed.</li><li>Some requests are malicious - think of DDoS attacks which try to saturate your service’s bandwidth, denying access to the service to legitimate users.</li></ul><h2 id="cascading-failures"><a href="#cascading-failures" aria-label="cascading failures permalink"></a>Cascading Failures</h2><p>You would think that if your system has hundreds of processes, it shouldn’t make much of a difference if a small percentage are slow or unreachable. The thing about faults is that they tend to spread like cancer, propagating from one process to the other until the whole system crumbles to its knees. This effect is also referred to as a <em>cascading failure</em>, which occurs when a portion of an overall system fails, increasing the probability that other portions fail.</p><p>For example, suppose there are multiple clients querying two database replicas A and B, which are behind a load balancer. Each replica is handling about 50 transactions per second.</p><p>{width: 75%}

    </span></p><p>As replica A starts to struggle to keep up with the incoming requests, the clients experience more failures and timeouts.

In the meantime, replica B becomes available again and the load balancer puts it back in the pool, at which point it’s flooded with requests that kill the replica instantaneously. This feedback loop of doom can repeat several time.</p><p>Cascading failures are very hard to get under control once they have started. The best way to mitigate one is to not have it in the first place by stopping the cracks in your services to propagate to others.</p><h2 id="defense-mechanisms"><a href="#defense-mechanisms" aria-label="defense mechanisms permalink"></a>Defense Mechanisms</h2><p>There is a variety of best practices you can use to mitigate failures, like circuit breakers, load shedding, rate-limiting and bulkheads.

                    <h2>How long does it take to walk 1 mile?</h2>
<p>As both research and actual scientific measurements, an average adult will walk 1 mile in 15 to 18 minutes at moderate to a brisk pace. Or in other words, 3 to 4 miles per hour.</p>
<p>This is a general measure for a healthy adult between 20 and 50 years old, at dry weather, on relatively flat terrain, with no destruction from cars and other environments.</p>
<p>If you are either less healthy or subjected to any of the environmental distractions, your speed, of course, will be lower.</p>
<h2>Average walking speed by age group and gender</h2>
<p>There is little difference between male and female, with males walking on average 2% faster.</p>
<p>The table below shows the speed of walking based on age and gender:</p>
<pre><code>| Age      | Sex    | Meters per second | Miles per hour |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 20 to 29 | Male   | 1.36              | 3.04           |
|          | Female | 1.34              | 3.0            |
| 30 to 39 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |
|          | Female | 1.34              | 3.0            |
| 40 to 49 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |
|          | Female | 1.39              | 3.11           |
| 50 to 59 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |
|          | Female | 1.31              | 2.93           |
| 60 to 69 | Male   | 1.34              | 3.0            |
|          | Female | 1.24              | 2.77           |
| 70 to 79 | Male   | 1.26              | 2.82           |

<h2>Benefits of walking</h2>
<p>There has been a great deal of research that showed that walking brings a huge advantage to humans. To both <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916518800798">physical, and mental well being.</a> The benefits are as follows:</p>
<p>Physical:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Covid and sitting time</h2>
<p>In the world of pandemics and covid, it has been evident that humans are sitting more and more and do less and less exercises. There is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221133552030214X">great research</a> that shows that 2020 has caused a sharp increase in average sitting time. The data is staggering.</p>
<p><code>Overall, 42.6% of participants reported sitting for &gt; 8 h/day (95% CI: 41.2%–44.0%) and 72.5% (71.2%–73.7%) reported being either sufficiently (150–300 MVPA minutes) or highly active (&gt;300 min).</code></p>
<p>If you want to boost your health and still to be able to keep up with a busy schedule walking or running can be the best idea for spending your free time. In the world where only entertainment inside your house is minimal. If being glued to the screen is no longer an option, than being outside can boost your health and your mental capabilities immensely.</p>

<h2>Tips on how to start walking</h2>
<h3>How to make walking a habit?</h3>
<p>The walk starts with the first step. It would be best if you did not put huge goals onto yourself. Start somewhere small, then later you can always adjust based on how you feel.</p>
<p>Start by putting on clothes(plus a mask) and go outside. Going back to your apartment would feel bad at that point.</p>
<p>Next, you should walk around your building or up and down the street.</p>
<p>Next, you walk around the block and later you can finally go for huge walks that can be a couple of hours long.</p>
<p>Don’t try to start at the last step that would only make you quit before you get the full benefit of the habit.</p>
<p>Peg your walking habit to something else. If you go for a coffee every morning, go to a coffee house that is further away. If you are usually riding a tube to work, start the journey at the stop further away from you</p>
<h3>Identify as a walker</h3>
<p>If you would like to start walking you need to think of <strong>how do you become a walker.</strong></p>
<p>You need to make sure you identify as someone who goes on walks, then keeping up with the habit will be much easier.</p>
<p>Next time someone asks you, whatever you do any exercises or what you love doing with your free time, you need to want to say that you love walking. At that point, you will be able to keep on walking and improving your health immensely.</p>
<h2>How much walking per week is enough?</h2>
<p>I think that it is tough to give a simple number for everyone, but if you are in the age range of 18-50, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>150 to 300 minutes per week is an ideal level if you are walking with moderate speed</li>
<li>75 to 150 minutes per week if you are walking with a brisk pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t think that doing extra physical exercise will be useless. In contrast, anything above that time limit will give even higher benefits to your health, so take the timing above as a general guideline. Do as much as you want.</p>
<h2>Personal tips on walking more</h2>
<h3>Wake up earlier</h3>
<p>Right now it is very easy to blame everything on covid and health, but not many people <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/how-to-wake-up-early">wake up very early in the morning</a>, that gives people that live in the city an ability to walk as much as they want, even in usually crowded spaces.</p>
<p>Also, your excuse of not having enough time can not be reinforced if you have an extra hour in the morning.</p>
<h3>Get a pet (dog)</h3>
<p>Even though it can seem like a lousy idea, multiple research papers show a relationship between owning a dog and the number of steps you do daily. If you are struggling to make time, your favourite pet will make you find time for walks.</p>
<p><img alt="man and dog walking in forest autumn" src="https://i.gyazo.com/5e16de8c0474f84f4285df88fab28c14.jpg"></p>
<h3>Podcasts and Audiobooks</h3>
<p>I love learning and listening to books. I do it all the time even when I am at home at my desk, so a change of pace for me is always going for an extended walk where I can do the same thing.</p>
<p>What I discovered is that I understand and remember information much better when I have consumed it while walking. That makes me spend twice as little time and getting twice the result. </p>
<p>Podcasts have been my go-to method of getting new relevant news and information in my field of expertise. Since I have started a habit of walking, I have been on top of my field and able to implement solutions that I would have never thought of otherwise.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I also love discovering new music. Sometimes when I really need to get my head around something I go for a brisk walk with my favourite songs. This helps me to unwind and later really understand the problem.</p>
<p>Most of the time while on the walk, I solve the problem that I had, and in my experience would off taken me much more time to solve.</p>
<h3>Walking groups</h3>
<p><img alt="walking groups picture" src="https://i.gyazo.com/26609ccb0d7ae90e9f746389479a32b0.jpg"></p>
<p>Sometimes socialising can be hard and especially when all of your friends are on the lockdown and all of the socialising places, such as restaurants, are closed. </p>
<p>That is where walking groups can come into play! You can find someone who is staying healthy and being diligent with their health and walk together! That will allow you to catch up and have social interaction, that we humans require.</p>
<h5>So what this means?</h5>
<p>Now you have a social responsibility in your habit, and the whole activity can let you be more motivated to do it.</p>
<p>Also, walking groups normally allow you to meet new people and to bond better with existing relationships.</p>
<p>Also, walking groups is a great way to speed up your walking pace and improve your health.</p>
<h2>How do I get better at walking?</h2>
<p>If you would like to improve the speed at which you walk, there are multiple ways to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned above, walking groups are amazing for giving you a speedup of pace, just make sure to not overdo it.</li>
<li>Walking poles (tracking poles) are an easy way to speed up the pace. They are especially useful for those with back or leg injury, that immensely help reduce the stress on joints and back as well as speed up the pace. There is a lot of research behind use cases and benefits of using them.</li>
<li>Treadmills. If you are unable to properly walk in the wild or in the park, get yourself a treadmill. Although they can be expensive, some are very cheap and immensely powerful alternatives provide the same result. You don’t need something overly expensive. Treadmills are great for controlling your pace as well as letting you support yourself with the rails that are at either side of the treadmill.</li>
<li>Have an open goal. Whenever you are walking, the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10413200.2020.1815100">research has shown</a> that having an open goal to where you want to walk or for how long will extend the amount of walking that you will eventually do.</li>
<li>Keep track of your metrics. Understanding what your heart rate and your pace are, is vital for your well being and motivation. Seeing that you have improved over a period of time is the greatest motivator there is.</li>
<li>Strive towards a 13 minutes per mile goal. The 13 minutes per mile has been shown to be the meeting point between fast walkers and the joggers. As …</li></ul></div></div>

      <b>Improbable Inspiration</b><p>
      The future of software may lie in the obscure theories of an
      18th century cleric named Thomas Bayes.

      </p><p>

      By LESLIE HELM, Times Staff Writer

      </p><hr>
      <p>

      When Microsoft Senior Vice President Steve
      Ballmer first heard his company was planning to make a huge
      investment in an Internet service offering movie reviews and
      local entertainment information in major cities across the
      nation, he went to Chairman Bill Gates with his concerns.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Ballmer has billions of dollars of
      his own money in Microsoft stock, and entertainment isn't
      exactly the company's strong point.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gates dismissed such
      reservations. Microsoft's competitive advantage, he responded,
      was its expertise in "Bayesian networks."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked recently when computers would finally
      begin to understand human speech, Gates began discussing the
      critical role of "Bayesian" systems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask any other software executive about
      anything "Bayesian" and you're liable to get a blank
      stare.

      </p><p> 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Gates onto something? Is this
      alien-sounding technology Microsoft's new secret weapon?

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite possibly.
      
      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks are complex diagrams that
      organize the body of knowledge in any given area by mapping out
      cause-and-effect relationships among key variables and encoding
      them with numbers that represent the extent to which one
      variable is likely to affect another.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programmed into computers, these systems can
      automatically generate optimal predictions or decisions even
      when key pieces of information are missing.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Microsoft in 1993 hired Eric Horvitz,
      David Heckerman and Jack Breese, pioneers in the development of
      Bayesian systems, colleagues in the field were surprised. The
      field was still an obscure, largely academic enterprise.

      </p><p>
 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the field is still obscure. But scratch
      the surface of a range of new Microsoft products and you're
      likely to find Bayesian networks embedded in the software. And
      Bayesian nets are being built into models that are used to
      predict oil and stock prices, control the space shuttle and
      diagnose disease.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial intelligence (AI) experts, who saw
      their field discredited in the early 1980s after promising a
      wave of "thinking" computers that they ultimately
      couldn't produce, believe widening acceptance of the Bayesian
      approach could herald a renaissance in the field.

      </p><p>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks provide "an
      overarching graphical framework" that brings together
      diverse elements of AI and increases the range of its likely
      application to the real world, says Michael Jordon, professor of
      brain and cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is unquestionably the most
      aggressive in exploiting the new approach. The company offers a
      free Web service that helps customers diagnose printing problems
      with their computers and recommends the quickest way to resolve
      them. Another Web service helps parents diagnose their
      children's health problems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest version of Microsoft Office
      software uses the technology to offer a user help based on past
      experience, how the mouse is being moved and what task is being
      done.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If his actions show he is distracted,
      he is likely to need help," Horvitz says. "If he's
      been working on a chart, chances are he needs help formatting
      the chart."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gates likes to talk about how computers
      are now deaf, dumb, blind and clueless. The Bayesian stuff helps
      deal with the clueless part," says Daniel T.  Ling,
      director of Microsoft's research division and a former IBM
      scientist.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks get their name from the
      Rev. Thomas Bayes, who wrote an essay, posthumously published in
      1763, that offered a mathematical formula for calculating
      probabilities among several variables that are causally related
      but for which--unlike calculating the probability of a coin
      landing on heads or tails--the relationships can't easily be
      derived by experimentation.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early students of probability applied the
      ideas to discussions about the existence of God or efforts to
      improve their odds in gambling. Much later, social scientists
      used it to help clarify the key factors influencing a particular
      event.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was the rapid progress in computer
      power and the development of key mathematical equations that
      made it possible for the first time, in the late 1980s, to
      compute Bayesian networks with enough variables that they were
      useful in practical applications.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bayesian approach filled a void in the
      decades-long effort to add intelligence to computers.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1970s and '80s, reacting to the
      "brute force" approach to problem solving by early
      users of computers, proponents of the emerging field of
      artificial intelligence began developing software programs using
      rule-based, if-then propositions. But the systems took time to
      put together and didn't work well if, as was frequently the
      case, you couldn't answer all the computer's questions clearly.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later companies began using a technique
      called "neural nets" in which a computer would be
      presented with huge amounts of data on a particular problem and
      programmed to pull out patterns. A computer fed with a big stack
      of X-rays and told whether or not cancer was present in each
      case would pick out patterns that would then be used to
      interpret X-rays.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the neural nets won't help predict the
      unforeseen. You can't train a neural net to identify an incoming
      missile or plane because you could never get sufficient data to
      train the system.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In part because of these limitations, a slew
      of companies that popped up in the early 1980s to sell
      artificial intelligence systems virtually all went bankrupt.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many AI techniques continued to be
      used. Credit card companies, for example, began routinely using
      neural networks to pick out transactions that don't look right
      based on a consumer's past behavior. But increasingly, AI was
      regarded as a tool with limited use.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the late 1980s--spurred by the early
      work of Judea Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA,
      and breakthrough mathematical equations by <a href="http://www.hugin.dk/">Danish researchers</a>--AI
      researchers discovered that Bayesian networks offered an
      efficient way to deal with the lack or ambiguity of information
      that has hampered previous systems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz and his two Microsoft colleagues, who
      were then classmates at Stanford University, began building
      Bayesian networks to help diagnose the condition of patients
      without turning to surgery.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach was efficient, says Horvitz,
      because you could combine historical data, which had been
      meticulously gathered, with the less precise but more intuitive
      knowledge of experts on how things work to get the optimal
      answer given the information available at a given time.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz, who with two colleagues founded
      Knowledge Industries to develop tools for developing Bayesian
      networks, says he and the others left the company to join
      Microsoft in part because they wanted to see their theoretical
      work more broadly applied.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the company did important work for
      the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and on medical
      diagnostics, Horvitz says, "It's not like your grandmother
      will use it."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft's activities in the field are now
      helping to build a groundswell of support for Bayesian ideas.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "People look up to Microsoft," says
      Pearl, who wrote one of the key early texts on Bayesian networks
      in 1988 and has become an unofficial spokesman for the
      field. "They've given a boost to the whole area."
                     
      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A researcher at German conglomerate Siemens
      says Microsoft's work has drawn the attention of his superiors,
      who are now looking seriously at applying Bayesian concepts to a
      range of industrial applications.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott Musman, a computer consultant in
      Arlington, Va., recently designed a Bayesian network for the
      Navy that can identify enemy missiles, aircraft or vessels and
      recommend which weapons could be used most advantageously
      against incoming targets.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musman says previous attempts using
      traditional mathematical approaches on state-of-the-art
      computers would get the right answer but would take two to three
      minutes.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you only have 30 seconds before the
      missile has hit you," says Musman.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Electric is using Bayesian techniques
      to develop a system that will take information from sensors
      attached to an engine and, based on expert opinion built into
      the system as well as vast amounts of data on past engine
      performance, pinpoint emerging problems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is working on techniques that will
      enable the Bayesian networks to "learn" or update
      themselves …</p></span></td></div></div>

Types work the <strong>same way</strong>, we classify program values based on the behaviour we’d like them to have. E.g. <code>int</code> for numbers that can be multiplied together, <code>string</code> for streams of characters that can be concatenated together.</p><p>The role of the type-checker is to prevent undesirable behaviour from happening - like concatenating <code>int</code>s or multiplying <code>string</code>s together - these operations make no sense so shouldn’t be allowed.</p><p>Most practical languages use types in one form or another. Some languages like Haskell are <em>statically</em> typed, meaning that the compiler checks the types at <em>compile-time</em>. You might argue, what about languages like JavaScript? There’s no compile-time type-checking there. These languages are <em>dynamically</em> typed, that is values are tagged with types and we check types at <em>runtime</em>, and throw a runtime error if types are mismatched. The runtime error acts as a very late safety check, stopping you just before you try to access a field of something that is <code>undefined</code>. So even JavaScript has types under the hood.</p><p>This all means that at some point, your fancy new language will likely implement some form of type-checking. With Bolt, I’ve chosen to implement <em>static</em> type-checking, i.e. the type-checking is another stage of our compiler.</p><p>Right now this all feels a little hand-wavey. What we need to do is take our high-level goal of “preventing undesirable behaviour” and formalise this.

We could have equally written this as <code>let x : t = e</code> - where the programmer <em>annotates</em> <code>x</code> with type <code>t</code>. e.g. <code>let x : int = 1 + 2</code>.</p><p>These lead to different typing algorithms - in the first case the compiler <em>infers</em> that <code>1+2</code> has type <code>int</code>, and in the second case, the compiler has to <em>check</em> that <code>1+2</code> has type <code>int</code> (since we specified the type <code>int</code> of <code>x</code>).</p><p>As you might imagine, type inference means that the programmer has to write fewer type annotations, but it is much more complex for the compiler - it’s like filling a Sudoku from scratch versus checking a Sudoku solution is valid. OCaml and Haskell are examples of languages with type inference baked in.</p><p>In practice, most statically-typed languages do require some type annotations, but can infer some types (e.g. the <code>auto</code> keyword in C++). This is like completing a partially solved Sudoku puzzle and is much easier.</p><p>For Bolt, we’re going to infer types <em>within</em> a function or method definition, but require programmers to annotate the parameter and return types.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As in the lovely child’s quote found on the internet —</p><blockquote><p>I know everything. Except anything I don’t.</p></blockquote><p>— we think that we see everything around us. But we don’t. There are so many things that greatly affect our lives, yet we don’t aware of them. One type of such things is deep inside us — the flaws of our own thinking. Here is my top list of those flaws.</p><h2 id="1-wishful-thinking-conservatism-and-conformism"><strong>1. Wishful thinking, conservatism and conformism</strong></h2><p>By <em>wishful thinking</em> I don’t mean optimism, which is rather speculation about the future. Wishful thinking is when we put more weight on the present knowledge that is pleasant to us, and at the same time ignore the knowledge that is not so nice. For example, people like to ignore the knowledge that puts them in a bad light. This is clearly seen in toxic relationships, where an abuser justifies his actions by “the care” of its victim. A dictator probably thinks that he is doing the best for its nation, while completely ignoring his incapabilities and bad doings. The same is true for groups of people or even nations. An invasion is commonly portrayed as liberation.</p><p>On the other hand, anyone who had experienced an addiction probably knows how it can alter decision-making. “Vodka is an antiseptic, didn’t you know? Let’s drink those bottles so we’ll be healthier!” Gambler thinks that he is going to make money, so his family will be happy. An ordinary gamer thinks that other real affairs are not that important, so it’s ok to spend more time on the game.</p><p>This is just few examples, but such thinking is so common that I don’t think a single book will be enough to collect all different “use cases”.</p><hr><p>Another flaw of our thinking is <em>conservatism</em> — an insufficient ability to change our common views and beliefs with the new data, new evidence. This is understandable — changing basis views leads to a reconsideration of all related knowledge. An enormous amount of rebuilding is required. Our biological brains just can’t do that in a short time, also it’s much harder with age. Because of this, we give much more weight to old knowledge rather than new evidence, thus making a conservatism bias.</p><p>In our rapidly changing world, this problem will have even more impact.</p><hr><p><em>Conformism</em> is when we weigh our knowledge in accordance with our community. The effect of this is highly underrated. An ordinary human thinks that “her thoughts are her own”, without realizing to what extent they are shaped by a community. I think that we’re all conformists to some degree. And it’s hard to imagine what’s that means not to be. This is proved by numerous experiments with a group of actors and one unsuspicious testee, where actors trick the testee to make some ridiculous statements or to do some crazy actions, like the one described <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP22DpYYh8">here</a>. We are social creatures.</p><p>An extreme version of conformist thinking is the one imposed by religion. I’m not against religions in general, they can be useful, but a blind belief, an unquestioning subordination to “sacred” authorities — that’s just a disaster for a clear mind. A clear mind should have the ability to stress any dogmas.</p><h2 id="2-binary-black-and-white-thinking-overgeneralization"><strong>2. Binary (black-and-white) thinking, overgeneralization</strong></h2><p>Good-evil, smart-stupid, beautiful-ugly, tall-short, fast-slow, and so on and on. We think in binary terms. Our language reflects that. And some people are stuck very hard in such thinking. The worst case of it is <em>all-or-nothing</em> thinking, when any result other than the best is considered as a failure. It causes stress and depression in people. They don’t realize anymore why the world is so mean to them. They stop seeing how many gradients are there, and also how colorful our world is.</p><p>A similar flaw is <em>overgeneralization</em>. We put into the same category very broad types of information. Prejudice, labeling, stereotypes are all related to overgeneralization.</p><h2 id="3-self-projecting-thinking"><strong>3. Self-projecting thinking</strong></h2><p>Mind reading is an ability that everyone would like to have. It would be so easier to communicate. Also, it’s an advantage if we could read the thoughts of our rivals. While we can’t do it in reality, we’re still trying to predict other people’s thoughts, both in collaboration and confrontation.</p><p>To make such predictions we use two main assumptions:</p><ol><li>Other people see the same things as we do.</li><li>Other people are like us, thus their way of thinking is similar to ours.</li></ol><p>Based on these assumptions we use our way of thinking to deduce the thoughts of others. And this is very natural since we have to model another person’s thinking somehow. But the only model that we have is ours. It’s the only model that we can use. So, we essentially project our mind into another person’s head.</p><p>This has a fatal flaw. Because both main assumptions are only half true. While we see the same bits of the world, perception is a way more complex process. From bits we see high-order patterns, but they can be very personal. People could see different patterns and focus on different things. Also, the same bits (e.g. colors) can cause different emotions. Associations are also personal. The way we do conclusions is also very different in people because every person has its own experience, principles, beliefs, preferences, etc. We do not understand how unique the mind of every human.</p><p>And this causes a lot of trouble. People are fighting because of misunderstandings. In most situations they don’t realize, that they are fighting against their own reflection (from a distorting mirror).</p><h2 id="4-human-centric-thinking"><strong>4. Human-centric thinking</strong></h2><p>Humans are extremely focused on their own businesses. Yes, we are successful as a whole, in comparison to other creatures. But we are still part of nature. We follow its laws. Despite this, we neglect nature and the life of other species at scale.</p><p>Moreover, we value leaders, rulers and heroes amongst us much more than others. Even in fiction secondary characters usually die (who cares), while all hail goes to the main performers. We think that leaders are responsible for like 99% of the job done. Thus, we are trying to analyze them, rather than abstract patterns, situations and laws of nature. For example, from the popular culture it may look like Hitler was solely responsible for WWII and the Holocaust. Yeah, sure. How about WWI? Or any other war, genocide, mass conflict in human history? It’s silly to think that all these things were mainly because of leaders. This is just how humans work. In every moment in history there is a mix of wishes, intentions, beliefs, possibilities, thoughts of a total population. It could be that nature just picks a random guy as a leader that represents the mass.</p><p>On the other hand, we think that human is a singular, indivisible unit. That’s also not true. We are a composition of attributes, that are selected by evolution. Any child has some attributes from its mother and some attributes from its father. Human is a composable organism, the same is true for its mind. I’m sure that everyone experienced competing thoughts in his head. There is a natural selection of thoughts ongoing in the mind of every human.</p><h2 id="5-false-associations-confusion-of-causation-and-correlation"><strong>5. False associations, confusion of causation and correlation</strong></h2><p>Our thinking is associative, and we can make connections very fast based on very small data. A typical example is superstition, which is clearly seen in <a href="https://www.psychologistworld.com/superstition">pigeon experiments</a>.</p><p>Survival bias and filtering are accompanying flaws that lead to false associations. In probability theory, this is related to the fact that independent events are not necessary conditionally independent.</p><p>Even when our associations are quite objective we can make false conclusions about the causes. In fact, in probability theory and statistics the notion of a <em>cause</em> is not even defined. Events can be either correlated or independent in this theory. To deduce <em>what causes what</em> we use other tools, like common sense, physics, etc. Typically, to deduce a causation from two correlated events, we check two main things:</p><ol><li>One event is earlier in time than another one.</li><li>There is no common cause that could explain the correlation.</li></ol><p>This is hard stuff even for scientists. Because you have to exclude any possible common cause. Earlier we could use physical locality of events to exclude a lot of possible common causes. But with the advance of quantum mechanics, even locality is not a reliable factor anymore.</p><h2 id="final-words"><strong>Final words</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of other flaws, if you want to learn more you can start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion">here</a>. But those described above I find the most impactful. I feel them myself and meet them all the time.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As a startup founder, you get pulled in a million different directions from the moment you start your company. It can be overwhelming to have to learn so many new skills at once: raising funds, hiring a team, managing people.</p>
<p>Before I started <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a> earlier this year, I spent almost a decade working with startups, reading, and preparing myself to run a business. I worked with some great people, met fantastic mentors, and read some outstanding books that gave me the confidence to go out on my own. In this post, I’ll give you my list of the best startup books available today.</p>
<h2 id="early-stage-startups">Early-Stage Startups</h2>
<p>This category includes books for people who are just starting out. If you are building your first product or raising the first round of funding, these books will provide you with a good starting point.</p>
<h3 id="founders-at-work-stories-of-startups-early-days"><a href="https://amzn.to/390FASS">Founders at Work: Stories of Startups’ Early Days</a></h3>
<p>What I love about this book is that it shows you how several popular technology companies started out. The book is a collection of interviews with founders of Paypal, Hotmail, Apple, and other giants of our era. It’s interesting to see where they got the ideas that eventually made them household names and how they recovered from various difficulties along the way.</p>
<p>“If you’re thinking about entrepreneurship you should read this book to get familiar with the possibilities, both the positives and the challenges. From the success arrived by a detour to the success of following a dedicated plan. There’s much to absorb and it’s just plain interesting.”</p>
<h3 id="the-innovators-dilemma"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nxL9fs">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a></h3>
<p>Written by the Harward professor and businessman Clayton Christensen, The Innovator’s Dilemma is one of the most important business books on the market. It explains how mammoth, successful companies can lose market leadership in a blink of an eye as new competitors rise and become dominant in emerging segments of their market.</p>
<p>“Christensen shows that successful innovation is not unpredictable. This comes with the recognition, however, that “data only exist about the past” and hence what is working in the present for leading firms need not apply to disruptive firms of the future. This paradigm necessarily applies to all companies and is not exclusive to technological ones.”</p>
<h3 id="the-lean-startup"><a href="https://amzn.to/2KhETKk">The Lean Startup</a></h3>
<p>We live in an age where technology changes rapidly and quickly changes the market around it. This means that sometimes, you have to move fast to avoid getting swallowed up by innovation. In The Lean Startup, Ries talks about his own business failure and how he spent too much time on the initial product launch instead of focusing on validating the market.</p>
<p>“This book focuses on giving an overview of Lean methods and convincing you why you should use them. It uses a lot of examples, mainly from startups. Some of the best examples come from the author’s own experience, and his company continues to do well.”</p>
<h3 id="zero-to-one-notes-on-startups-or-how-to-build-the-future"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fg4EWN">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fg4EWN"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eN4XABh.jpg" alt="Zero to One book cover"></a></p>
<p>I don’t love Peter Thiel’s politics, but I do like how he pushes readers to think for themselves. He explains that you don’t necessarily have to fight the competition to be the leader in the market. Instead, by thinking out of the box and creating a brand new market, you can become a leader with no competition at all. With a unique idea, you can escape the rivals and focus completely on your unique value proposition.</p>
<p>“Let me assure you that Zero to One is worth reading, even if you’re not engaged in the world of startups and venture capital. It’s worth reading in the same way a triple espresso is worth drinking: it makes you feel superhuman, at least for the moment. You can almost hear the caffeine coursing through your veins as you absorb the ideas.”</p>
<h3 id="the-art-of-the-start"><a href="https://amzn.to/38YBhXT">The Art of the Start</a></h3>
<p>Although named “The Art of the Start,” this book covers various business areas, including the art of launching, positioning, socializing, and marketing your startup. In 13 easy-to-read chapters, Guy Kawasaki talks about crucial topics for startup founders like finding a business idea, finding the right co-founder, writing a vision statement, and defining your business model.</p>
<p>“Never assume you’re done. Recruiting doesn’t stop when a candidate accepts your offer, nor when he resigns from his current employer, nor on his last day at his current employer—not even after he starts at your organization. In actuality, recruiting never stops. Every day is a new contract between a startup and an employee.”</p>
<h3 id="the-startup-owners-manual"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nxLiQ2">The Startup Owner’s Manual</a></h3>
<p>With over a hundred charts, graphs, and valuable checklists, this book helps startup founders in many ways. For example, it teaches you how to avoid “deadly sins” that lead your business to failure and how to drive your company to repeatable and scalable profits. The methods in this book were created by Steve Blank, a famous Silicon Valley startup, and were tested by him for more than a decade.</p>
<p>“Best entrepreneur book period. If you liked Lean Startup (another great read/education) you’ll love this one by Steve Blank. He taught those guys. I love how the author really reset your approach and lays out a clear plan on how to test and scale.”</p>
<h2 id="growth-stage-startups">Growth Stage Startups</h2>
<p>Books in this category will teach you how to grow your business from the first few customers to wider adoption. These will also help you sell high-dollar products and scale your sales to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="crossing-the-chasm-marketing-and-selling-high-tech-products-to-mainstream-customers"><a href="https://amzn.to/2UL4oWm">Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers</a></h3>
<p>I first read this classic over a decade ago. It explains the way products move to progressively more mainstream markets and how you can cross the “chasm” from early adopters to these lucrative mass markets. Although technology changes rapidly, the principles in Crossing the Chasm can still be applied in the software industry today.</p>
<p>“The author’s emphasis is on distinguishing between the selling and marketing tactics for the early innovators versus mainstream customers. There is a chasm between the innovators and mainstream market and the author dedicates the book outlining the various steps a high tech company should perform to successfully navigate through the chasm.”</p>
<h3 id="hacking-growth-how-todays-fastest-growing-companies-drive-breakout-success"><a href="https://amzn.to/35Mrz99">Hacking Growth: How Today’s Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success</a></h3>
<p>Ever wonder why Facebook unseated early entrants like MySpace to become the number one social network? Or how Uber succeeded despite seeming to have no chance against New York’s Yellow Cabs? With the proper methodology - known as “growth hacking” - they became the giants of our era. Sean and Morgan’s stories inspired me, and I recommend this book to any founder who will handle marketing.</p>
<p>“The authors walk the reader through each stage of building a growth machine, give examples from real companies, and, the best part, they apply this process to a hypothetical scenario/product so you can see what it would look like from beginning to end.”</p>
<h3 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fjCUAS">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a></h3>
<p>This book is a collection of stories from the career of Ben Horowitz, one of the most respected entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley. It reveals problems that he faced during his journey from being a founder to becoming an investor. It analyzes difficulties that confront leaders every day, related to management, selling, investment, and staying balanced.</p>
<p>“If you’re planning to start a company, whether it’s a high-tech company or the kinds of companies that I started and ran, read this book. If you’re going to be someone in charge of anything in any kind of a company, read this book.”</p>
<h3 id="great-at-work-how-top-performers-do-less-work-better-and-achieve-more"><a href="https://amzn.to/2IXvYNp">Great at Work: How Top Performers Do Less, Work Better, and Achieve More</a></h3>
<p>Early in my career, I worked too much on too many projects. It took me nearly a decade to figure out that putting hours into <em>the right</em> things was the key. This book debunks the myth of multitasking, talks about coordinating between priorities, and reveals how to make your work time more productive.</p>
<p>“With the massive amount of business books published every year, it’s tough to find a book with some original ideas. This book is one of those. What’s great about it is that there isn’t a lot of fluff and the book gets to the points of what can help one become a great performer. I would recommend this book to any leader out there who wants to help his or her team grow and become more, with less of the wrong kind of work.”</p>
<h2 id="hiring-and-management">Hiring and Management</h2>
<p>At some point in running a business, you will have to build a team of professionals around you. You will likely move into management, which requires an entirely new set of skills. These books helped me out, and I’m sure you will find them useful, too.</p>

<p>I learned the hard way that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">many business-related problems have their roots in poor hiring practices</a>. Instead of hiring consistent A-players, many startup founders rush to assemble half-hearted teams that are bound to fail. Hyman shows his ten practical steps to recruiting top talent in this book. My favorite part was about choosing employees based on data instead of gut feeling, and I used this to create <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/hiring-rubric">my first hiring rubric at Draft.dev</a>.</p>
<p>“This is the recruitment guide that every startup needs to read. It’s especially valuable for people who might not have a background in recruiting but find themselves in a position where they need to hire the best. Recruit Rockstars is a clear and concise guide that won’t waste your time and gives you the recruitment background you need. I can’t recommend this book enough!”</p>

<p>Written by the former chairman of Intel, this book shows startup founders how to build highly productive teams that lead the company to peak performance. Management isn’t about posturing or power-struggles. It’s about getting results.</p>

<p>“The author emphasizes the importance of judging managers based on the output that they achieve, which is an accumulation of the outputs of the people that work for them. He also focuses on the importance of continuing to improve yourself and strive to be better. He rightly points out that nobody owes you …</p></div></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>When Sweden announced their laissez-faire approach to COVID-19, experts, and politicians around the world, were in disbelief. Without a lockdown and mandatory masks, this could only end in a disaster. The famous model used to justify the lockdown in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4?r=DE&amp;IR=T">UK and many other countries</a>, predicted 100.000 deaths by June if Sweden did not follow all the other countries and institute strict measures. It is now November, and at the time of writing, 6,972 people have died in Sweden from COVID-19. So what happened?</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>Let’s take a step back and look at the famous model, which was the basis for many of the government measures back in March as well as for the 100.000 death prediction: The Imperial Model. It was developed by Neil Fergusson and his team at the Imperial College London.</p><p>The involvement of Neils Fergusson should already have raised doubts about the validity of the model because his track record, and there is no other way to say this, is terrible. If you think it cannot be that bad, you are in for a surprise.</p><p>We will do what <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4?r=DE&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a> promised back in April:</p><blockquote>Here's what we know about “Professor Lockdown” and the gold standard in science that is Imperial College.</blockquote><p>Of course, they did not mention his past predictions, and the “gold standard” turned out to be fake gold, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. His past predictions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ferguson-Estimating-the-human-health-risk-from-possible-BSE-infection-of-the-British-sheep-flock.pdf">In 2002</a>, Ferguson predicted that up to 150,000 people could die from exposure to BSE (mad cow disease) in the U.K. There were only 177 deaths.</li><li><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/professor-lockdown-modeler-resigns-in-disgrace/">In 2009</a>, Ferguson predicted that the bird flu could kill 150 million people. 282 people died worldwide.</li><li><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/six-questions-that-neil-ferguson-should-be-asked">In 2009</a>, Ferguson predicted as a “reasonable worst-case scenario” that the swine flu would kill 65,000 people in Britain. It killed 457.</li></ul><p>I think that is enough about our “Professor Lockdown.” We want to focus more on the model and “the gold standard in science that is Imperial College.”</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>One reason why nobody doubted the model was that it was secret—always a smart move. When on March 16, 2020, Neil and his team published their paper, they did not publish their code. Yes, you read that correctly. Their paper made several policy recommendations based on predictions of a model <em>they did not publish</em>. So there was no way of knowing if their claims were true or false. They were simply baseless claims without any evidence.</p><p>To me, this destroys any trustworthiness Neil Ferguson might have had left. One hallmark of science is independent verifiability. Without others being able to verify the claims and run the model themselves, it is not science; it is pseudo-science with a strong appeal to authority.</p><p>On April 27, over one month after the paper in question was published, they finally released their code on <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim">GitHub</a>. However, it turns out that they did not release the original code used to generate the predictions in their paper. The released version was edited by software engineers of GitHub to make it acceptable:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before the GitHub team started working on the code it was a single 15k line C file that had been worked on for a decade, and some of the functions looked like they were machine translated from Fortran. There are some tropes about academic code that have grains of truth, but \</p>— John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1254872369556074496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>As you can read in this Tweet, the original code was “a single 15k line C file that had been worked on for a decade.” Everyone with a little bit of knowledge about software engineering should be shocked. A single 15000 line C file is beyond bad practice.</p><p>But even GitHubs’s engineers could not salvage the code. The released version is still riddled with bugs and random equations that literally nobody can explain. Moreover, even if the released code were exactly the code used in the paper, no one could have replicated the results because the input parameters used in the paper were not published. As the <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/tree/master/data">GitHub page</a> reads:</p><blockquote>IMPORTANT: The parameter files are provided as a sample only and do not necessarily reflect runs used in published papers.</blockquote><p>At this point, we are long past science, with a small s, and far into the world of Science, with a capital S. The latter is the world where the term “Believe the Science” makes sense. While science (small s) is the process of doubting everything, disregarding authority, and searching for the truth, Science (capital S) is where the truth is determined by fiat, and your job is to believe, not question it. But I digress.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>After several issues around the non-deterministic behavior of the model were brought up on GitHub, the team responded with an <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/116#issuecomment-617304550">interesting answer</a>:</p><blockquote>We are aware of some small non-determinisms when using multiple threads to set up the network of people and places. (Look for the omp critical pragmas in the code). This has historically been considered acceptable because of the general stochastic nature of the model.</blockquote><p>Non-deterministic means that given the same input, you do not always get the same output (non-deterministic behavior is not necessarily bad; only in cases like this where it is not explainable). Their answer to this problem was that it does not matter because the model is “stochastic,” which is just a fancy word for saying that they run the model multiple times and average over all the outcomes.</p><p>Every time a new issue around non-determinism came up or a different bug was discovered, the team’s answer was the <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/30">same</a>:</p><blockquote>This isn’t a problem running the model in full as it is stochastic anyway.</blockquote><p>But is this really true? You do not have to worry about bugs because “it is stochastic anyway”? The answer is, obviously, no.</p><p>To understand this stochastic magic better, let’s take a look at an example: baking a cake. If we weigh flour, we might weigh it several times and then average over all these measurements—only if we are nerds and want to follow the recipe particularly closely, of course. But why does this give us a more accurate result? The answer is that if, for example, we make an error when reading from the scale (imagine an old analog scale), then an error in one direction (more) is as likely as an error in the other direction (less). In other words, if the flour weighs 100 grams, you are just as likely to mistake it for 102 g the first time, and 98 g the next. Only if we make mistakes sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, averaging out works. Otherwise, <em>it does not</em>. If your scale is broken, and always shows five grams more, averaging does not help you.</p><p>The same is true for bugs. If, and only if, we could be sure that the bugs distort the output sometimes upwards and sometimes downwards (preferably with equal probability and magnitude), we could solve the problem by running the model “stochastically.” However, this is not the case because, by definition, we do not know how bugs affect the code; otherwise we would understand them and probably be able to fix them. The point is that nobody, including the “scientists” who produced this model, can know how those bugs affect the code.</p><p>Do not get me wrong, stochastic models are not necessarily like this. Most of the time, if the model is not too complicated (we will get to this point later), small changes in the input create small changes in the output, and the randomness in the output stems from intentionally included pseudo-randomness. However, this model is not non-deterministic in the predictable (explainable) mathematical sense. It is non-deterministic in the angry-toddler-in-a-toy-store sense: nobody knows what is going to happen, and there is no way to replicate it. <a href="https://medium.com/@allenfarrington/simple-truths-and-complex-nonsense-2e1c28ae6f29">Put differently</a>:</p><blockquote>It has nondeterministic outputs that do not follow from seeded pseudorandomness but are rather an inexplicable part of the process. I am not using “inexplicable” rhetorically here: nobody can explain this. This is one of the great issues in Complexity Science. Clearly there is a stark mathematical difference between deterministic and non-deterministic. But there is also a fuzzy, and arguably more important, difference between non-deterministic and really, really, really NON-DETERMINISTIC.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the Imperial Model falls into the latter category.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Alright, a summary of what we have learned so far: the code was not released with the paper; the released code is not the code used in the paper; the original code was a single 15 thousand line C file; the model is non-deterministic bordering on chaotic; the parameters released are not the parameters used in the paper; the code is riddled with bugs. An impressive list for a “scientific” model that informed government decisions on life and death.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>But what about the model without the code? Sure, the code that implements the model is awful, but maybe they have figured out a great way to model pandemics and just need better software engineering to make it work. Sadly, this is not the case.</p><p>Do you remember the parameters that were <em>not</em> provided so nobody could replicate the results of the paper? It turns out that the model has 450 input parameters. Let me say it again: the model depends on <em>450 (!!!)</em> parameters. Nobody can understand a model with this many parameters. And it gets even worse because as it turns out, complex systems like pandemics have many interdependencies, which complicates everything. As described by Allen <a href="https://medium.com/@allenfarrington/simple-truths-and-complex-nonsense-2e1c28ae6f29">here</a>:</p><blockquote>Now I should be clear that, maybe, the virus is that complicated. But it doesn’t matter. Because we can’t possibly understand this. And actually I lowballed it by a factor of 450 (Oh, God …). Because if this system is linear, which it surely is not, what this really means is that a single set of parameters can be represented as a 450-dimensional column vector acting on a 450x450 matrix with 450² = 202k independent numbers. Because, remember, the parameters can be anything. Katya suspects they are totally made up. So it’s not just the dimensions we need to account for. The surface of the earth has 2 dimensions but more than 2 locations. Assuming every entry in this matrix has only two possible states, which it surely does not, this model maps a system with at least …</blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

Sorry once again for the infrequent posts.
I've been busy.
Originally, because I was supposed to get married this summer.
Then because my fiancée cheated on me while I was watching my grandfather die
and moved in with the other guy the following week.
So that's been fun, but I'm trying to get back into some more productive habits.
Hopefully that includes blogging regularly.

<h2 id="sum-types-and-you">Sum Types and You</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about a simple, yet powerful concept in programming: <em>sum types</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A sum type, also called a <em>discriminated union</em>,
can hold one (and only one) of several types of things.
For example, consider some settings in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a>-like configuration file.
Let’s say that each setting must be a string, an integer, or a Boolean value.
If we wanted to roll our own solution in C++, we might write something resembling:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Setting</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>str</span><span>;</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
        <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>enum</span> <span>Type</span> <span>{</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>};</span>
    <span>Type</span> <span>tag</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// Map settings to their names.
</span><span>using</span> <span>Settings</span> <span>=</span> <span>unordered_map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>Setting</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here be dragons, though, since we must always remember to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Update <code>tag</code> whenever assigning a new value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only retrieve the correct type from the union (according to <code>tag</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call constructors and destructors at appropriate times for all non-trivial types.
(<code>string</code> is the only one here, but you could imagine similar
scenarios with others.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a step is ever forgotten, the object falls into an
inconsistent state and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
You could encapsulate all this trickery and interact with the type
through a series of methods—e.g., <code>getType()</code>, <code>asBool()</code>,
<code>asString()</code>, and so on—but this is quite verbose.
It also just shifts the problem onto whoever implements these methods; they
still need to carefully maintain the invariants with no help from the language.</p>

<p>It would be much nicer if a general-purpose sum type was provided by the standard
library.
In C++17, we finally get one!
It’s called <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant"><code>std::variant</code></a>.
Let’s take a look.</p>

<h2 id="using-stdvariant">Using <code>std::variant</code></h2>

<p><code>variant</code> is a class template that takes, as template parameters, the types
it could hold.
For the example above,
we could define a setting as a <code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span></code>.
Assigning a value to a <code>variant</code> works just like you might expect:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>string</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once we put a value into a <code>variant</code>, we’ll eventually want to look at what that
value is, and just as importantly, what the type of the value is.
This is where the fun begins.
Some languages offer dedicated <em>pattern matching</em> syntax for the task,
such as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>theSetting</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Str</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Int</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Bool</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>),</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>but this didn’t make the cut for C++17.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Instead we’re given a companion function called <code>std::visit</code>.
It takes the <code>variant</code> you want to examine, along with
some <em>visitor</em> that is callable for each type in the variant.</p>

<p>How do we define such a visitor?
One way is to create an object that overloads the call operator
for relevant types:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SettingVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This seems terribly verbose, and it gets even worse
if we want our visitor to capture or modify some other state.
Hmm—<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7627218">lambdas</a> are perfect
for capturing state.
What if we could build a visitor from those?</p>
<div><pre><code><span>make_visitor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"bool: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That’s a bit better, but the standard library doesn’t provide any sort of
<code>make_visitor</code> to combine the lambdas into a callable object for us.
We’ll need to define it ourselves.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Fs</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>;</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>F0</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Frest</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F0</span><span>,</span> <span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>overload</span><span>(</span><span>F0</span> <span>f0</span><span>,</span> <span>Frest</span><span>...</span> <span>rest</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span><span>(</span><span>f0</span><span>),</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span>...)</span> <span>{}</span>

    <span>using</span> <span>F0</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>();</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>operator</span><span>();</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>F0</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F0</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>overload</span><span>(</span><span>F0</span> <span>f0</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span><span>(</span><span>f0</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

    <span>using</span> <span>F0</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>();</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Fs</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>make_visitor</span><span>(</span><span>Fs</span><span>...</span> <span>fs</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Fs</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>...);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here we use C++11’s <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack">variadic templates</a>.
They must be defined recursively, so we create some base case <code>F0</code>,
then use that to define a cascading set of constructors for <code>overload</code>,
each of which peels off a lambda argument and adds it to the type
as a call operator.</p>

<p>If this seems troublesome, fear not! C++17 will offer a new syntax
that reduces all of the above to:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>struct</span> <span>overloaded</span> <span>:</span> <span>Ts</span><span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>using</span> <span>Ts</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>()...;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>(</span><span>Ts</span><span>...)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ts</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, right? But if don’t like any of these options, you could
use C++17’s compile-time conditionals instead:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>[](</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>decay_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"bool: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Much better, no?</p>

<h2 id="no">No.</h2>

<p>The rigmarole needed for <code>std::visit</code> is entirely insane.
We started with a simple goal: look at the contents of a sum type.
To accomplish this meager mission, we had to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define a function object, which requires a lot of
boilerplate, <em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Define our behavior with lambdas, which required:
    <ul>
      <li>An understanding of variadic templates, in all their recursively-defined fun, <em>or</em></li>
      <li>A familiarity with variadic <code>using</code> declarations, fresh on the scene from C++17.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Use compile-time conditionals, which require you to know
about—and grok—the new <code><span>constexpr</span> <span>if</span></code> syntax, along with
<code>type_traits</code> fun like
<code>std::decay</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these concepts are too enigmatic if you’re an experienced C++ developer,
but several are certainly “advanced” features of the language.
Things have really gone sideways if we need to know so much
to do something so simple.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>

<p>My goal isn’t to disparage the folks on the ISO C++ committee
who picked this approach.
I’ve had beers with some of them,
and they’re smart, kind, hardworking people.
I’m sure that I’m missing important context since I’ve never sat in on a
standards meeting or read all of the relevant
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/">committee papers</a>.
But from an outsider’s perspective, the disparity in complexity between the
problem being solved (“What’s in here?”)
and the solutions is just nuts.
How do you teach this without overwhelming a beginner with all this other…
stuff?
Is it expected to be common knowledge for your everyday programmer?
(And if the goal of adding <code>variant</code> to the standard library <em>isn’t</em> to
make it a tool for the masses, shouldn’t it be?)
The very least C++17 could do—if the committee didn’t have the time or resources
to get pattern matching into the language—is provide something akin to <code>make_visitor</code>.
But that too is left as an exercise for the user.</p>

<p>If I had to guess how we ended up this way,
I’d assume it comes down to confirmation bias.
Maybe when a bunch of really smart people who know how
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a> works offhand
and don’t flinch when they see the likes of</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>F</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>typename</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if</span><span>&lt;!</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_reference</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>type</span>
<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>F</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>get together, the result is something like <code>std::visit</code>.
Nobody proclaims that the emperor has no clothes, or that it’s completely
bonkers to expect the average user to build an overloaded callable
object with recursive templates just to see if the thing they’re looking at
holds an <code><span>int</span></code> or a <code><span>string</span></code>.</p>

<p>I’m also not here to claim that C++ is too complicated for its own good,
but it’s certainly more complicated than it has to be.
Scott Meyers, the guy who wrote <em>Effective&nbsp;C++</em> and <em>Effective Modern&nbsp;C++</em>,
has made similar noises in <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/47947981">recent</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/RT46MpK39rQ?t=29m51s">talks</a>.
To paraphrase Meyers, I’m sure each member of the committee cares very much
about avoiding needless complexity and making the language easier to use.
But if you look at the results of their work, it’s hard to tell.
The accidental complexity just keeps stacking up.</p>

<h2 id="where-are-we-headed">Where are we headed?</h2>

<p>There’s a reason C++ is so widely used, especially in systems programming.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
It can be incredibly expressive, yet gives you nearly full control of your hardware.
The tooling around it is some of the most mature of any programming language
out there, bar C.
It supports a ridiculous number of platforms.</p>

<p>But even if you set aside all the historical baggage, it has some serious shortcomings.
Spend any amount of time messing with D and you’ll quickly realize that
metaprogramming needn’t require self-flagellation and insane syntax.
Play with Rust and <!-- Hi, PCJ --> you’ll feel like <code>unique_ptr</code>
and <code>shared_ptr</code>—which themselves have been a breath of fresh air—are
a bad joke.
The fact that we still handle dependencies in 2017
by literally copy-pasting files into each other with <code><span>#include</span></code>
macros is <em>obscene</em>.</p>

<p>You get the impression, based on what ends up in the ISO standards and what
you hear in conference talks,
that those driving C++ are trying to eliminate some of these shortcomings by
glomming nice bits from other languages onto it.
That’s a great idea on its face,
but these features often seem to arrive half-baked.
While C++ isn’t going away any time soon,
it feels like the language is constantly playing a clumsy game of catchup.</p>

<hr>

<p>In spite of all of this,
I’ll be busy encouraging my coworkers to use <code>variant</code> if anybody needs me.
Sum types are such a useful concept that they’re worth the pain,
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvtFGa6XJDU">to quote Jon Kalb</a>,
“If you can’t program in a language with ugly warts, maybe C++ isn’t the language
you should be programming in.”</p>

    <p>Constructing the MNIST-1D dataset. As with the original MNIST dataset, the task is to learn to classify the digits 0-9. Unlike the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 images, each of these examples is a one-dimensional sequence of points. To generate an example, we begin with 10 digit templates and then randomly pad, translate, add noise, and transform them as shown above.</p>
  	</div>
</div>





<p>By any scientific standard, the Human Genome Project <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/62798">was enormous</a>: it involved billions of dollars of funding, dozens of institutions, and over a decade of accelerated research. But that was only the tip of the iceberg. Long before the project began, scientists were hard at work assembling the intricate science of human genetics. And most of the time, they were not studying humans. The foundational discoveries in genetics centered on far simpler organisms such as peas, molds, fruit flies, and mice. To this day, biologists use these simpler organisms as genetic “minimal working examples” in order to save time, energy, and money. A well-designed experiment with Drosophilia, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746727/">Feany and Bender (2000)</a>, can teach us an astonishing amount about humans.</p>

<p>The deep learning analogue of Drosophilia is the MNIST dataset. A large number of deep learning innovations including <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html">dropout</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam</a>, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">convolutional networks</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">generative adversarial networks</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">variational autoencoders</a> began life as MNIST experiments. Once these innovations proved themselves on small-scale experiments, scientists found ways to scale them to larger and more impactful applications.</p>

<p>They key advantage of Drosophilia and MNIST is that they dramatically accelerate the iteration cycle of exploratory research. In the case of Drosophilia, the fly’s life cycle is just a few days long and its nutritional needs are negligible. This makes it much easier to work with than mammals, especially humans. In the case of MNIST, training a strong classifier takes a few dozen lines of code, less than a minute of walltime, and negligible amounts of electricity. This is a stark contrast to state-of-the-art vision, text, and game-playing models which can take months and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08900">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> of electricity to train.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of its historical significance, MNIST has three notable shortcomings. First, it does a poor job of differentiating between linear, nonlinear, and translation-invariant models. For example, logistic, MLP, and CNN benchmarks obtain 94, 99+, and 99+% accuracy on it. This makes it hard to measure the contribution of a CNN’s spatial priors or to judge the relative effectiveness of different regularization schemes. Second, it is somewhat large for a toy dataset. Each input example is a 784-dimensional vector and thus it takes a non-trivial amount of computation to perform hyperparameter searches or debug a metalearning loop. Third, MNIST is hard to hack. The ideal toy dataset should be procedurally generated so that researchers can smoothly vary parameters such as background noise, translation, and resolution.</p>

<p>In order to address these shortcomings, we propose the MNIST-1D dataset. It is a minimalist, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to MNIST, designed for exploratory deep learning research where rapid iteration is a priority. Training examples are 20 times smaller but they are still better at measuring the difference between 1) linear and nonlinear classifiers and 2) models with and without spatial inductive biases (eg. translation invariance). The dataset is procedurally generated but still permits analogies to real-world digit classification.</p>

  <p>Visualizing the MNIST and MNIST-1D datasets with tSNE. The well-defined clusters in the MNIST plot indicate that the majority of the examples are separable via a kNN classifier in pixel space. The MNIST-1D plot, meanwhile, reveals a lack of well-defined clusters which suggests that learning a nonlinear representation of the data is much more important to achieve successful classification.

<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example use cases</h2>

<p>In this section we will explore several examples of how MNIST-1D can be used to study core “science of deep learning” phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>Finding lottery tickets.</strong> It is not unusual for deep learning models to have ten or even a hundred times more parameters than necessary. This overparameterization helps training but increases computational overhead. One solution is to progressively prune weights from a model during training so that the final network is just a fraction of its original size. Although this approach works, conventional wisdom holds that sparse networks do not train well from scratch. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> challenges this conventional wisdom. The authors report finding sparse subnetworks inside of larger networks that train to equivalent or even higher accuracies. These “lottery ticket” subnetworks can be found through a simple iterative procedure: train a network, prune the smallest weights, and then rewind the remaining weights to their original initializations and retrain.</p>

<p>Since the original paper was published, a multitude of works have sought to explain this phenomenon and then harness it on larger datasets and models. However, very few works have attempted to isolate a “minimal working example” of this effect so as to investigate it more carefully. The figure below shows that the MNIST-1D dataset not only makes this possible, but also enables us to elucidate, via carefully-controlled experiments, some of the reasons for a lottery ticket’s success. Unlike many follow-up experiments on the lottery ticket, this one took just two days of researcher time to produce. The curious reader can also <a href="https://bit.ly/3nCEIaL">reproduce these results</a> in their browser in a few minutes.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Finding and analyzing lottery tickets. In <b>a-b)</b>, we isolate a "minimum viable example" of the effect. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02773">Morcos et al (2019)</a> shows that lottery tickets can transfer between datasets. We wanted to determine whether spatial inductive biases played a role. So we performed a series of experiments: in <b>c)</b> we plot the asymptotic performance of a 92% sparse ticket. In <b>d)</b> we reverse all the 1D signals in the dataset, effectively preserving spatial structure but changing the location of individual datapoints. This is analogous to flipping an image upside down. Under this ablation, the lottery ticket continues to win.</p>
</div>

  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b1.png">
  </p>
  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b2.png">
  </p>
    <p>Next, in <b>e)</b> we permute the indices of the 1D signal, effectively removing spatial structure from the dataset. This ablation hurts lottery ticket performance significantly more, suggesting that part of the lottery ticket's performance can be attributed to a spatial inductive bias. Finally, in <b>f)</b> we keep the lottery ticket sparsity structure but initialize its weights with a different random seed. Contrary to results reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>, we see that our lottery ticket continues to outperform a dense baseline, aligning well with our hypothesis that the lottery ticket mask has a spatial inductive bias. In <b>g)</b>, we verify our hypothesis by measuring how often unmasked weights are adjacent to one another in the first layer of our model. The lottery ticket has many more adjacent weights than chance would predict, implying a local connectivity structure which helps gives rise to spatial biases.</p>

<p>You can also visualize the actual masks selected via random and lottery pruning:

<p><strong>Observing deep double descent.</strong> Another intriguing property of neural networks is the “double descent” phenomenon. This phrase refers to a training regime where more data, model parameters, or gradient steps can actually <em>reduce</em> a model’s test accuracy<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4">4</a></sup>. The intuition is that during supervised learning there is an interpolation threshold where the learning procedure, consisting of a model and an optimization algorithm, is just barely able to fit the entire training set. At this threshold there is effectively just one model that can fit the data and this model is very sensitive to label noise and model mis-specification.</p>

<p>Several properties of this effect, such as what factors affect its width and location, are not well understood in the context of deep models. We see the MNIST-1D dataset as a good tool for exploring these properties. In fact, we were able to reproduce the double descent pattern after a few hours of researcher effort. The figure below shows our results for a fully-connected network and a convolutional model. We also observed a nuance that we had not seen mentioned in previous works: when using a mean square error loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n * K\) model parameters where \(n\) is the number of training examples and \(K\) is the number of model outputs. But when using a negative log likelihood loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n\) model parameters – it does not depend on the number of model outputs. This is an interesting empirical observation that may explain some of the advantage in using a log likelihood loss over a MSE loss on this type of task. You can reproduce these results <a href="https://bit.ly/2UBWWNu">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>05/12/2020</strong></p>

<p>TLDR: use <code>gen_random_uuid</code> to generate v4 uuids.</p>

<p>There are two main functions to generate v4 uuids in postgres, <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> and <code>gen_random_uuid</code>. In postgres 13, <code>gen_random_uuid</code> is a built in function. Otherwise you will need to install the <code>pgcrypto</code> extension. <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> requires the <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension. Depending how postgres is configured, postgres may actually use different libraries for the <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension (ossp-uuid, libc, libuuid) see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/uuid-ossp.html">postgres doc</a> for more info.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<pre><code>CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";
</code></pre>

<pre><code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT uuid_generate_v4() FROM generate_series(1, 10000);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT gen_random_uuid() FROM generate_series(1, 10000);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All benchmarks used postgres 12.x.</li>
  <li>On windows, postgres was installed using https://www.enterprisedb.com.</li>
  <li>On linux, postgres was installed using respective package managers.</li>
  <li>All tests were done on google cloud VMs.
    <ul>
      <li>e2-medium: (2 vCPUs, 4 GB, HDD)</li>
      <li>e2-standard-4: (4 vCPUs, 16 GB, HDD)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<table>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>e2-standard-4</td>
      <td>windows-server-2019</td>
      <td>4400ms</td>
      <td>5ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>More investigation is required to determine why <code>uuid_generate_v4()</code> is so slow on windows server. It’s unclear what underlying lib the enterprisedb postgres is using for <code>uuid-ossp</code>. Regardless of why it’s slow on windows server, the best option for now is to use <code>gen_random_uuid</code> which is significantly faster on all platforms tested and comes built in on postgres 13.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>To be sure the windows issue was not limited to the edb postgres 12.4 version, I did one quick benchmark on the latest edb postgres 13 and found similar execution times for uuid_generate_v4.</p>

<p>If you’re using PiHole on your network to block ads and prevent your various smart devices from sending tracking information to their manufacturers, <strong>you might be surprised to find out that some of these devices are using a sneaky tactic to bypass your PiHole entirely.</strong></p>
<p>Smart devices manufacturers often “hard-code” in a public DNS server, like Google’s 8.8.8.8, and their devices ignore whatever DNS server is assigned by your router - such as your PiHole.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08288.pdf">Nearly 70% of smart TVs and 46% of game consoles</a> were found to contain hardcoded DNS settings - allowing them to simply ignore your local network’s DNS server entirely. On average, Smart TVs generate an average of 60 megabytes of outgoing Internet traffic <em>per day</em>, all the while bypassing tools like PiHole.</p>
<h2 id="force-all-dns-queries-through-pihole">Force all DNS queries through PiHole</h2>
<p>Fortunately, with a few simple firewall rules, you can intercept these hardcoded DNS queries and redirect them to your PiHole. These instructions are for pfSense, however you should be able to adapt them for Sophos XG, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, etc.</p>
<h3 id="create-nat-rules">Create NAT Rules</h3>
<p>Log in to your pfSense admin interface, and navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Port Forward</em>.</p>
<p>We’re going to create two Port Forward NAT rules - one to redirect any DNS queries originating from devices on the LAN to PiHole, and another to allow PiHole to commmunicate with external DNS servers. We will also create an additional outbound NAT rule that will make this process invisible to any clients on the network with hardcoded DNS.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 1: Redirect DNS queries to PiHole</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your first new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> LAN net (you may need to click the blue show advanced button to see this option)</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Invert match:</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Address/mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - To:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target IP:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target Port:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Intercept any outgoing DNS queries and redirect them to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 2: Exempt PiHole from DNS query redirects</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your second new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No RDR (NOT):</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Source - Address/Mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination:</strong> Any</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Allow PiHole to reach external DNS servers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> pfSense (and most other firewalls) process rules from top to bottom. Make sure you drag the second rule exempting PiHole from DNS query redirects <em>above</em> the first rule we created - otherwise PiHole will not be able to contact external DNS servers.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 3: Prevent clients from giving unexpected source errors</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we need to create an outbound NAT rule. Navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Outbound</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Address Family:</strong> IPv4+IPv6</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> any</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Source - Network for the outbound NAT mapping:</strong> Your internal LAN network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Network for the outbound NAT Mappings:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP Address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range:</strong> 53</li>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Interface Address</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Prevents hardcoded DNS clients from giving unexpected source error after DNS redirected to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-it-out">Test it out</h3>
<p>You can easily test to make sure your DNS redirection is working properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new, temporary internal DNS entry on your network (“piholetest.example.com”), and point it to 10.0.1.1. You can do this right from PiHole under <em>Local DNS Records</em>.</li>
<li>Manually set your computer’s DNS server to <em>1.1.1.1</em>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window (or command promt on Windows), and run <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code></li>
<li>
<p>If you set this up correctly, <code>nslookup</code> should return 10.0.1.1. Your computer <em>thinks</em> it’s receiving DNS records from 1.1.1.1, while in reality they are coming from your PiHole.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 Name:	piholetest.example.com
 Address: 10.0.1.1
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can further demonstate this by temporarily disabling the first NAT rule we created, and running the same <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 ** server can't find piholetest.example.com: NXDOMAIN 
</code></pre></div> </div>
<p>As “piholetest.example.com” doesn’t exist on the public Internet, the real 1.1.1.1 server has no record to provide - resulting in your <code>nslookup</code> request returning a NXDOMAIN error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to revert your computer’s DNS settings back to their original value, and reenable any firewall rules you temporary disabled while testing.</strong></p>

  <p>If you were using computers in the ‘90s and the early 2000s, you probably had the experience of installing a piece of software you downloaded from the internet, only to discover that someone put some nasty into it, and now you’re dragging your computer to IT to beg them to save your data. To remedy this, software developers started “signing” their software in a way that proved both who they were and that nobody tampered with the software after they released it. Every major operating system now supports code or application signature verification, and it’s a backbone of every app store.But what about Kubernetes? How do we know that our Docker images aren’t secret bitcoin miners, stealing traffic away from customers to make somebody rich? That’s where Binary Authorization comes in. It’s a way to apply the code signing and verification that modern systems now rely on to the cloud. Coupled with Voucher, an open source project started by my team at Shopify, we’ve created a way to prevent malicious software from being installed without making developers miserable or forcing them to learn cryptography.</p>
<h2>Why Block Untrusted Applications?</h2>
<p>Your personal or work computer getting compromised is a huge deal! Your personal data being stolen or your computer becoming unusable due to popup ads or background processes doing tasks you don’t know about is incredibly upsetting.</p>
<p>But imagine if you used a compromised service. Imagine if your email host ran in Docker containers in a cluster with a malicious service that wanted to access contents of the email databases? This isn’t just your data, but the data of everyone around you.</p>
<p>This is something we care about deeply at Shopify, since trust is a core component of our relationship with our merchants and our merchants’ relationships with their customers. This is why Binary Authorization has been a priority for Shopify since our move to Kubernetes.</p>
<h2>What is Code Signing?</h2>
<p>Code signing starts by taking a hash of your application. Hashes are made with hashing algorithms that take the contents of something (such as the binary code that makes up an application) and make a short, reproducible value that represents that version. A part of the appeal of hashing algorithms is that it takes an almost insurmountable amount of work (provided you’re using newer algorithms) to find two pieces of data that produce the same hash value.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a file that has the text:</p>
<p><code>Hello World</code></p>
<p>The hash representation of that (using the “sha256” hashing algorithm) is:</p>
<p><code>d2a84f4b8b650937ec8f73cd8be2c74add5a911ba64df27458ed8229da804a26</code></p>
<p>Adding an exclamation mark to the end of our file:</p>
<p><code>Hello World!</code></p>
<p>Results in a completely different hash:</p>
<p><code>03ba204e50d126e4674c005e04d82e84c21366780af1f43bd54a37816b6ab340</code></p>
<p>Once you have a hash of an application, you can run the same hashing algorithm on it to ensure that it hasn’t changed. While this is an important part of the code signing, most signing applications will automatically create a hash of what you are signing, rather than requiring you to hash and then sign the hash separately. It makes the hash creation and verification transparent to the developers and their users.</p>
<p>Once the initial release is ready, the developer that’s signing the application creates a public and private key for signing it, and shares the public key with their future users. The developer then uses the private part of their signing key and the hash of the application to create a value that can be verified with the public part of the key.</p>
<p>For example, with Minisign, a tool for creating signatures quickly, first we create our signing key:</p>

<p>The public half of the key is now:</p>
<p><code>RWSs3jHbeTsmYhWlyqpDEufCe5QSGHsb1fFnglZItPwDfJ3wEZzSGyBJ</code></p>
<p>And the private half remains private, living in&nbsp;<code>/Users/caj/.minisign/minisign.key</code>.</p>
<p>Now, if our application was named “hello” we can create a signature with that private key:</p>

<p>And then your users could verify that “hello” hasn’t been tampered with by running:</p>

<p>Unless you’re a software developer or power user, you likely have never consciously verified a signature, but that’s what’s happening behind the scenes if you’re using a modern operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where is Code Signing Used?</h2>
<p>Two of the biggest users of code signing are Apple and Google. They use code signing to ensure that you don’t accidentally install software updates that have been tampered with or malicious apps from the internet. Signatures are usually verified in the background, and you only get notified if something is wrong. In Android, you can turn this off by <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/alternative-distribution.html" target="_blank" title="Alternative distribution options - Android Developer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">allowing unknown apps in the phone's settings</a>, whereas iOS requires the device be jailbroken to allow unsigned applications to be installed.</p>
<p><img alt="A macOS dialog window showing that Firefox is damaged and can't be opened. It gives users the option of moving it to the Trash." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/FirefoxMessage.jpg?v=1606786217" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/FirefoxMessage.jpg?v=1606786217"></p>
<p><br><em>A macOS dialog window showing that Firefox is damaged and can't be opened. It gives users the option of moving it to the Trash.</em></p>
<p>In macOS, applications that are missing their developer signatures or don’t have valid signatures are blocked by the operating system and advise users to move them to the Trash.</p>
<p>Most Linux package managers, (such as Apt/DPKG in Debian and Ubuntu, Pacman in ArchLinux) use code signing to ensure that you’re installing packages from the distribution maintainer, and verify those packages at install time.</p>
<p><img alt="Docker Hub showing a docker image created by the author." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/DockerImage.jpg?v=1606786314" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/DockerImage.jpg?v=1606786314"><br><em>Docker Hub showing a docker image created by the author.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kubernetes doesn’t have this by default. There are features that allow you to leverage code signing, but chances are you haven’t used them.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, do you really trust some rando on the internet to actually give you a container that does what it says it does? Do you want to trust that for your organization? Your customers?</p>
<h2>What is Binary Authorization?</h2>
<p>Binary Authorization is a series of components that work together:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A metadata service: a service that stores signatures and other image metadata</li>
<li>A Binary Authorization Enforcer: a service that blocks images that it can’t find valid signatures for</li>
<li>A signing service: a system that signs new images and stores those signatures in the metadata service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google provides the first two services for their Kubernetes servers, which Shopify uses, based on two open source projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grafeas, a metadata service</li>
<li>Kritis, a Binary Authorization Enforcer</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Kritis and Grafeas or the Binary Authorization feature in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), infrastructure developers will configure policies for their clusters, listing the keys (also referred to as attestors) that must have signed the container images before they can run.</p>
<p>When new resources are started in a Kubernetes cluster, the images they reference are sent to the Binary Authorization Enforcer. The Enforcer connects to the metadata service to verify the existence of valid signatures for the image in question and then compares those signatures to the policy for the cluster it runs in. If the image doesn’t have the required signatures, it’s blocked, and any containers that would use it won’t start.You can see how these two systems work together to provide the same security that one gets in one’s operating system! However, there’s one piece that wasn’t provided by Google until recently: the signing service.</p>
<h2>Voucher: The Missing Piece</h2>
<p>Voucher serves as the last piece for Binary Authorization, the signing service. Voucher allows Shopify to run security checks against our Docker images and sign them depending on how secure they are, without requiring that non-security teams manage their signing keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Using Voucher's client software to check an image with the 'is_shopify' check, which verifies if the image was from a Shopify owned repository." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/ImageApproved.jpg?v=1606786428" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/ImageApproved.jpg?v=1606786428"><br><em>Using Voucher's client software to check an image with the 'is_shopify' check, which verifies if the image was from a Shopify owned repository.</em></p>
<p>The way it works is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Voucher runs in Google Cloud Run or Kubernetes and is accessible as a REST endpoint</li>
<li>Every build pipeline automatically calls to Voucher with the path to the image it built</li>
<li>Voucher reviews the image, signs it, and pushes that signature to the metadata service</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of the basic code signing workflow discussed previously, Voucher also supports validating more complicated requirements, using separate security checks and associated signing keys to mix and match required signatures on a per cluster basis to create distinct policies based on a cluster’s requirement.</p>
<p>For example, do you want to block images that weren’t built internally? Voucher has a distinct check for verifying that an image is associated with a Git commit in a Github repo you own, and signing those images with a separate key.</p>
<p>Alternatively, do you need to be able to prove that every change was approved by multiple people? Voucher can support that, creating signatures based on the existence of approvals in Github (with support for other code hosting services coming soon). This would allow you to use Binary Authorization to block images that would violate that requirement.</p>
<p>Voucher also has support for verifying the identity of the container builder, blocking images with a high number of vulnerabilities, and so on. And Voucher was designed to be extensible, allowing for the creation of new checks as need be.By combining Voucher’s checks and Binary Authorization policies, infrastructure teams can create a layered approach to securing their organization’s Kubernetes clusters. Compliance clusters can be configured to require approvals and block images with vulnerabilities, while clusters for experiments and staging can use less strict policies to allow developers to move faster, all with minimum work from non-security focused developers.</p>
<h2>Voucher Joins Grafeas</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Voucher serves a need that hasn’t been provided by Google <i>until recently</i>. This is because <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/introducing-voucher-service-help-secure-container-supply-chain" target="_blank" title="Introducing Voucher, a service to help secure the container supply chain" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Voucher has moved into the Grafeas organization</a> and now is a service provided by Google to Google Kubernetes Engine users going forwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since our move to Kubernetes, Shopify’s security team has been working with Google’s Binary Authorization team to plan out how we’ll roll out Binary Authorization and design Voucher. We also released Voucher as an open source project in December 2018. This move to the Grafeas …</p></div></div>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<p>If you’re using PiHole on your network to block ads and prevent your various smart devices from sending tracking information to their manufacturers, <strong>you might be surprised to find out that some of these devices are using a sneaky tactic to bypass your PiHole entirely.</strong></p>
<p>Smart devices manufacturers often “hard-code” in a public DNS server, like Google’s 8.8.8.8, and their devices ignore whatever DNS server is assigned by your router - such as your PiHole.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08288.pdf">Nearly 70% of smart TVs and 46% of game consoles</a> were found to contain hardcoded DNS settings - allowing them to simply ignore your local network’s DNS server entirely. On average, Smart TVs generate an average of 60 megabytes of outgoing Internet traffic <em>per day</em>, all the while bypassing tools like PiHole.</p>
<h2 id="force-all-dns-queries-through-pihole">Force all DNS queries through PiHole</h2>
<p>Fortunately, with a few simple firewall rules, you can intercept these hardcoded DNS queries and redirect them to your PiHole. These instructions are for pfSense, however you should be able to adapt them for Sophos XG, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, etc.</p>
<h3 id="create-nat-rules">Create NAT Rules</h3>
<p>Log in to your pfSense admin interface, and navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Port Forward</em>.</p>
<p>We’re going to create two Port Forward NAT rules - one to redirect any DNS queries originating from devices on the LAN to PiHole, and another to allow PiHole to commmunicate with external DNS servers. We will also create an additional outbound NAT rule that will make this process invisible to any clients on the network with hardcoded DNS.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 1: Redirect DNS queries to PiHole</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your first new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> LAN net (you may need to click the blue show advanced button to see this option)</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Invert match:</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Address/mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - To:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target IP:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target Port:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Intercept any outgoing DNS queries and redirect them to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 2: Exempt PiHole from DNS query redirects</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your second new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No RDR (NOT):</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Source - Address/Mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination:</strong> Any</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Allow PiHole to reach external DNS servers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> pfSense (and most other firewalls) process rules from top to bottom. Make sure you drag the second rule exempting PiHole from DNS query redirects <em>above</em> the first rule we created - otherwise PiHole will not be able to contact external DNS servers.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 3: Prevent clients from giving unexpected source errors</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we need to create an outbound NAT rule. Navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Outbound</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Address Family:</strong> IPv4+IPv6</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> any</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Source - Network for the outbound NAT mapping:</strong> Your internal LAN network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Network for the outbound NAT Mappings:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP Address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range:</strong> 53</li>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Interface Address</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Prevents hardcoded DNS clients from giving unexpected source error after DNS redirected to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-it-out">Test it out</h3>
<p>You can easily test to make sure your DNS redirection is working properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new, temporary internal DNS entry on your network (“piholetest.example.com”), and point it to 10.0.1.1. You can do this right from PiHole under <em>Local DNS Records</em>.</li>
<li>Manually set your computer’s DNS server to <em>1.1.1.1</em>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window (or command promt on Windows), and run <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code></li>
<li>
<p>If you set this up correctly, <code>nslookup</code> should return 10.0.1.1. Your computer <em>thinks</em> it’s receiving DNS records from 1.1.1.1, while in reality they are coming from your PiHole.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 Name:	piholetest.example.com
 Address: 10.0.1.1
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can further demonstate this by temporarily disabling the first NAT rule we created, and running the same <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 ** server can't find piholetest.example.com: NXDOMAIN 
</code></pre></div> </div>
<p>As “piholetest.example.com” doesn’t exist on the public Internet, the real 1.1.1.1 server has no record to provide - resulting in your <code>nslookup</code> request returning a NXDOMAIN error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to revert your computer’s DNS settings back to their original value, and reenable any firewall rules you temporary disabled while testing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Out of all Lisps the ones I’ve come to appreciate the most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common
Lisp</a>. <!--break-->These two languages are fundamentally very different: Scheme
is a minimalist language built on the foundations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, while
Common Lisp is a multi-paradigm synthesis of many Lisps before it. Common Lisp
is a large standard with many implementations, Scheme is a collection of an
evolving but minimalistic standard with many implementations. The core of Scheme
is quite small compared to Common Lisp. The latest standard <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/r6rs-lib.pdf">R6RS</a> is about 65
pages, while the ANSI Common Lisp standard from 1994 is about 1100 pages. The
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/">Scheme Requests for Implementation</a> process aims to standardize additional
features (like <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html">test suites</a>) that implementations may implement.</p>

<p>Common Lisp has some wonderful features, <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html">conditions and restarts</a>, the <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/clos.html">Common
Lisp Object System (CLOS)</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">the macro system</a>, among many other things. The <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY
IDE for Emacs</a> is <em>amazing</em>, and the <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> compiler is really
great. It has <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/index.html">Quicklisp</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/">ASDF</a> for package and build management,
respectively. I find the developer experience of Common Lisp to be superior to
almost anything imaginable, and this is not an empty statement: having used all
sorts of IDEs and editors for over 25 years, I have seen <em>many</em>.</p>

<h3 id="tastes-differ">Tastes differ</h3>

<p>That said, Common Lisp is <em>weird</em>. What I find particularly jarring is that
functions and variables live in different namespaces: if you put a function into
a variable, you can’t just use it like a function, you have to <code>funcall</code> it.
Having programmed in lots of languages of the ML family this is just, well, odd;
but this is due to historical reasons and there are <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html">sound technical reasons for
it</a>.  There are other
oddities, some strange things like <code>(cdr '())</code> is not an error (in Scheme it
is), <code>()</code> and <code>nil</code> are equal (in Scheme <code>#f</code> and <code>()</code> are separate things), and
so on.</p>

<p>This isn’t really a fault in Common Lisp: other languages have impacted my taste
and preferences to bias me in the direction of Scheme, but that is not to say I
cannot work with Common Lisp’s idiosyncracies. Actually, I don’t mind them, I
just <em>notice</em> them.</p>

<p>I like the naming styles of Scheme more, as well. It has <code>string?</code> vs <code>string-p</code>
for predicate functions, <code>set!</code>  for state modifying functions, <code>foo-&gt;bar</code> for
conversions, these make code quite easier to read. Scheme has hygienic macros,
Guile has the traditional <code>defmacro</code> as well.</p>

<p>Many nice Scheme features are available in Common Lisp libraries. Pattern match
is available in the <a href="https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia">trivia</a> library. Named lets are easy to implement with a macro.</p>

<p>Common Lisp aficionados are quick to point out things Scheme <em>doesn’t</em> have:
keyword arguments, docstrings, rest arguments, but my Scheme implementation of
choice Guile has these built into the language.</p>

<h3 id="productivity-matters">Productivity matters</h3>

<p>Guile is in a strange niche is that its primary <em>raison d’être</em> is to be an
extension language for the GNU project. Like Emacs Lisp is for extending Emacs,
Guile is the <em>de facto</em> language for GNU programs for extension and scripting.</p>

<p>Guile doesn’t have Quicklisp and its package manager and build system is
basically nonexistent for the first and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a> for the second. There is
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2017-03/msg00168.html">sentiment</a> in the Guile community to have <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> as the package manager for
Guile. This might sound a bit onerous, since Guix is also a complete package
management for many other things than Guile, but consider this: as Andy Wingo
points out in his message that Guile libraries often come with C extensions,
Guile packages need some sort of managed build system for building the C
extensions. Since it doesn’t have one, to solve the problem of building a
package manager you’d also have to build a build system that can manage C code
and packages needed by the C code bits. To do this elegantly is a gargantuan
task, for instance, <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions#installing-eggs-that-use-libraries">chicken-install just asks you to put compiler/linker flags
on the command line before calling it</a>, so it obviously is a hard problem.</p>

<p>Now, Guix solves all that, and more, in a manner that is quite elegant and
interesting. But it’s not as lightweight as something like Quicklisp or
<a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions"><code>chicken-install</code></a> from <a href="http://call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a>. What is more, Guix works only on GNU/Linux
systems really, so macOS and Windows users won’t be able to do use your library
if you plan on distributing it via Guix. Duh, it’s the GNU project, but
portability is always nice.</p>

<p>But in Common Lisp I can write <code>(ql:quickload :alexandria)</code> and voilà, it will
automatically install the <a href="http://quickdocs.org/alexandria/">Alexandria</a> library that I can use. Then again, in
Common Lisp it’s somewhat rarer to have C extensions, so I don’t know how ASDF
handles that.</p>

<p>It is unfair to compare <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY</a> to <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/geiser/">Geiser</a>, the best Emacs Scheme integration
package.  SLY is based on <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> which has <em>decades</em> of man-years of work behind
it. Geiser is able to support multiple Scheme implementations and it is quite
impressive in this regard. But SLY obviously has much more (e.g. an interactive
debugger). That said, Geiser has nice Guile support, and Guile is in general the
most Common Lisp-y of all Schemes, in fact, it has</p>

<ul>
  <li>an imitation of CLOS in the form of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/goops/">GOOPS</a></li>
  <li>docstrings and keyword, rest, and optional arguments for function
definitions</li>
  <li>an interactive REPL and a mutable top-level (unlike many Schemes)</li>
  <li>a nice module system</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Defmacros.html"><code>defmacro</code></a> and exceptions somewhat <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Raising-and-Handling-Exceptions.html">similar to Common Lisp restarts </a></li>
</ul>

<p>and some nice things Common Lisp doesn’t have like first-class
continuations. But then again I would use those rarely.</p>

<h3 id="when-would-i-pick-one-over-the-other">When would I pick one over the other?</h3>

<p>If I were to write an extensible C/C++/Rust program that I <em>know</em> will need to use
a low-level language, I might do the low level bits using a low level language
and then write the rest in Guile. Guile makes it very easy to spin up a REPL
socket to do something like <code>myprogram --repl=12345</code> that you can connect to, and
the interop between C and Guile is fantastic, it has to be, as it’s primarily an
extension language.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if were to build a wholly standalone application, the choice is
not as obvious. I could do the whole thing in either language. Common Lisp can
build native executables, although their size will be large (who cares?) since
the binary will include the whole Lisp implementation. Guile cannot compile to
native code so you’ll have to write a script executable, but that doesn’t really
matter.</p>

<p>Scenarios where I would pick Guile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I’m making an extensible program that has to have some C/C++ bits but I
want to make it scriptable by users</li>
  <li>when I want to write a native binary but not write too much C/C++ code</li>
  <li>I just want to write Scheme, because Scheme is a bit more elegant</li>
  <li>the project has something to do with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU project</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, Common Lisp makes the most sense if I just want to enjoy a
seriously rapid development experience, a large standard library and language,
and I don’t mind having 50MB binaries (again, who cares?) if I were to write
standalone programs. Guile can’t do that, but it’s easy to either write Guile
scripts or a C program that essentially bootstraps a binary to load a Scheme
runtime. This is how <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is written, for example.</p>

<p>So the answer to which one is decidedly <strong>both</strong>! Both languages are really fun to
write. At the moment I don’t do Lisp at my day job so it’s all for fun
anyway. If this were for professional purposes, I don’t know. Very often a
strict requirement for professional work is to be able to be productive. In that
regard I think Common Lisp has a significant edge, not only due to its superior
development experience, but its history as a real production language. There are
actual companies doing stuff in Common Lisp. I have not heard of any
professional (in the industrial sense) uses of Guile, notwithstanding that many
projects powered by Guile (Guix, etc.)  are <em>extremely</em> professional in the way
they are written and maintained. But Common Lisp has <em>more</em> libraries and
companies behind it.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-clojure">What about Clojure?</h3>

<p>I’ve actually had the pleasure to use Clojure for personal fun, and a little bit
of professional use. I wrote a couple of libraries (<a href="https://github.com/ane/vigil">vigil</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ane/task">task</a>) and my
experience with has always been positive and its development experience is
excellent. Clojure isn’t a true Lisp, or well, it is part of the <em>Lisp
family</em>. Its ability to interface with the JVM makes it easy to leverage the
thousands of JVM libraries out there.</p>

<p>I’d gladly do it again, though I feel that Common Lisp with CLOS and its module
system makes it somewhat easier to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small"><em>programming in the large</em></a>. Clojure
explores interesting territories with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/spec">spec</a>, so it is interesting to see what
direction the language will take in the future.</p>

<h3 id="final-words-emacs-lisp">Final words: Emacs Lisp</h3>

<p>There’s also a parenthetical elephant in the room here: Emacs Lisp! An old
descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclisp">MacLisp</a>, it’s actually quite fun to write, and the fact that Emacs
itself is the interpreter, you have superb introspectability for any Elisp
code. Most of the Lisp I write these days is probably Emacs Lisp. It’s very
close to Common Lisp. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#Overview">cl-lib</a> adds a sufficient amount of convenience from
Common Lisp to make Elisp writing quite enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eieio.html#Top">EIEIO</a> adds a subset of CLOS
that can be used seamlessly with cl-lib. The condition system is missing.</p>

<p>I’ve also done a fair bit of <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>, a Lisp that compiles to Lua. I used it to
write a <a href="https://github.com/ane/mudrally">small game</a> and it was fun to write since you could develop the game in a
REPL.</p>

<p>All in all, Lisp in all its variants is the most fun I’ve ever had while
programming a computer. Guile and Common Lisp are definitely the most fun I’ve
had programming in <em>Lisp</em>.</p>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>The delivery of mouse and touch events in Qt Quick is complex, and it became clear a few years ago that we needed to refactor the event inheritance hierarchy, to have some common API for various event types, so that more of the delivery code could be shared. In Qt 5.8 we added QQuickPointerEvent and associated types, as a way of prototyping what that could look like. They are QObjects; and since then, QQuickWindow has been delivering these wrapper events that carry the original events inside. Now finally in Qt 6 we have been able to complete the QEvent refactoring, so that QQuickWindow no longer needs the wrappers. Along with that, we were able to add a few features and fix a few bugs. Many of the remaining bugs that seemed intractable in Qt 5 should at least be possible to fix later on.</p>
<!--more--><h2>Say hello to QPointerEvent and QEventPoint</h2>
<p>The inheritance hierarchy now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png" alt="event-hierarchy-qt6" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=640&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1920&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=2560&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3200&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3840&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"><br>QPointerEvent is the new abstract type for all events that come from pointing devices (mouse, touchscreen, tablet stylus). It has the common API to be able to handle all these in a device-agnostic way. Since QTouchEvent can carry multiple touchpoints in one event, we standardized this concept: every QPointerEvent represents potentially a cluster of QEventPoint instances (even though most events only carry one point), and therefore has appropriate API: points(), point(i) and pointCount(). <br>Every QInputEvent (including QPointerEvent) carries a pointer to the QInputDevice that it came from. This allows event-handling code to respond in device-specific ways, even when handling synthetic mouse events. </p>
<p>Every QEventPoint has velocity. The Kalman filter that Qt Quick was using in Qt 5 has been moved to QtGui, so that the average velocity from the last few movements is available wherever the event is delivered. This enables velocity-sensitive behavior (such as distinguishing a slow drag from a quick flick, or responding to a particular direction of movement) regardless which device it comes from. Instantaneous velocity is generally too volatile for such purposes, but if you need it you can calculate it as <code>(globalPosition() - globalLastPosition()) / (timestamp() - lastTimestamp())</code>. </p>
<p>QSinglePointEvent is another abstract type that standardizes the position accessors that used to be separately and inconsistently implemented in QMouseEvent, QTabletEvent, QHoverEvent, QWheelEvent and a few more. They are all floating-point now. position() replaces pos() and posF(), scenePosition() replaces windowPos(), and globalPosition() replaces screenPos(). The old accessors are still there for now, but deprecated: a Qt 5 application will not encounter an SC break just because of handling QMouseEvent, for example. QEventPoint replaces QTouchEvent::TouchPoint, but there is a "using" declaration for the sake of source compatibililty. </p>
<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/ec1oud/clazy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forked clazy</a> and added a new qevent-accessors check, which might save you some trouble: it can automatically apply "fixits" to get rid of the deprecation warnings stemming from the event accessor renaming. (Yes we should upstream that change.)</p>
<h2>Device-agnostic event handling in C++</h2>
<p>In various places in Qt we can now respond to mouse, touch and tablet events (such as detecting a click or a drag), either by iterating the QEventPoints, or just responding to the first point. Here's a contrived example of how a QQuickItem subclass could do that: </p>
<pre>bool MyItem::event(QEvent *ev) override {<br>  if (ev-&gt;isPointerEvent()) {<br>    QPointerEvent *pev = static_cast&lt;QPointerEvent *&gt;(ev);<br>    for (QEventPoint &amp;point : pev-&gt;points()) {<br>      switch (point.state()) {<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Pressed:<br>        if (reactToPress(point.position()))<br>          pev-&gt;setExclusiveGrabber(point, this);<br>        break;<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Updated:<br>        ...<br>      }<br>    }<br>    return true;<br>  }<br>  return QQuickItem::event(ev);<br>}</pre>
<p>QQuickFlickable::childMouseEventFilter() works this way, for example. And that has an interesting result: </p>
<h2>Flickable handles touch now! </h2>
<p>There were many open bugs related to the fact that Qt 5's Flickable could only handle actual mouse events and synthetic mouse events. Qt only supports one mouse, one mouse position, one cursor (so far, but we're working on that...) and therefore you could not flick two Flickables with two fingers. If you touch some component inside the Flickable that is able to handle touch events, but then you drag your finger across the Flickable in the allowed direction, it uses childMouseEventFilter() to steal the grab from that component; but that involved switching from the actual touch event to a synthetic mouse event, and also remembering to deliver the following updates as synth-mouse events to Flickable. Various things went wrong. Well... those days are over, because Flickable::childMouseEventFilter() no longer cares which device the QPointerEvents come from. If you set pressDelay, it's able to withhold the actual touch press and then replay it to the items inside when the timer expires. Yes, you can now drag multiple Flickables with multiple fingers too.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1280&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif" alt="parallel-flickables" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=640&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1280&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1920&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=2560&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=3200&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=3840&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"><br>Multi-touch still doesn't work with the remaining mouse-only items like MouseArea though, because those still rely on synth-mouse events. But it can be avoided. In general: try to use Event Handlers rather than MouseArea, because (as its name indicates) it's not really intended to support anything more than mouse interaction. </p>
<p>QTabletEvents (from your Wacom stylus, Samsung S-pen, Apple Pencil etc.) are also just pointer events that carry a few more properties, and can be handled by any device-agnostic code that handles mouse and touch events. But we will keep working on improving the experience with those. We didn't add any new virtual functions in QQuickItem for them, but they will get delivered to QQuickItem::event() soon. </p>
<p>Another thing we're still working on is making Flickable behave better with laptop touchpads. A fix is coming soon. </p>
<h2>Left to your own devices</h2>
<p>Platform plugins now have responsibility to discover and register input devices, in order to fulfill the promise that every QInputEvent tells you exactly where it came from. Some of this work is already done on some of the platforms. (On others it's proving to be problematic.) You can get a list of all registered devices from QInputDevice::devices(). The qtdiag utility also shows you this list. </p>
<p>QInputDevice is a QObject, and its parent() can be another device in case there is a natural hierarchy: for example, X11 has master and slave devices, and a tablet stylus "belongs to" a particular tablet device. In other cases, the parent is simply an object within the platform plugin that owns the device for memory management purposes. </p>
<p>On the platforms where the device discovery work is not done, QInputEvent::device() is never null, but may be a generic instance taken from QInputDevice::primaryKeyboard() or QPointingDevice::primaryMouse(). Touchscreen devices are unique though; we already did it that way in Qt 5. </p>
<p>QInputDevice::seatName() correponds to the Wayland notion of a "seat": a set of devices that one user is using. There is little multi-seat support so far, but it will be improved over time. If you configure a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Multi-pointer_X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-pointer X server</a>, you can see different seat names on different devices, but those names are automatically generated from xinput IDs in the xcb plugin. On Wayland compositors such as <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/sway/sway-input.5.en.html#SEAT_CONFIGURATION" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sway</a>, it's possible to give the seats arbitrary names; and we plan that Qt will eventually work with that. </p>

December 5, 2020 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-11-25-asterius-th/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-11-25-asterius-th/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Template Haskell (TH) is a widely used yet controversial language extension. You have
probably used it in your own code; with a single line of splice code, you can
achieve tasks like deriving instances and embedding files easily. And you might
also have heard the reasons why people may dislike it: it slows down
compilation, breaks encapsulation, arbitrary IO at compile time is risky, etc.</p>
<p>But it is less well known that Template Haskell also makes cross compilation
with GHC harder. In this post, we’ll show why this is a challenge, some existing
solutions developed by the community, and in particular, how this problem is
addressed by <a href="https://github.com/tweag/Asterius">Asterius</a>.</p>
<h2>Just run some code at compile time, what can go wrong?</h2>
<p>Conceptually, Template Haskell is a principled way of generating Haskell AST at
compile time, like in the simplified example below:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>

<span><span>import</span> Data.Char</span>
<span><span>import</span> Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax</span>
<span><span>import</span> System.Process</span>

<span>gitRev</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
<span>gitRev</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>$</span><span>(</span> <span>do</span>
       <span>rev</span> <span>&lt;-</span>
         <span>runIO</span> <span>$</span>
           <span>filter</span> <span>isHexDigit</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>readProcess</span> <span>"git"</span> <span>[</span><span>"rev-parse"</span><span>,</span> <span>"HEAD"</span><span>]</span> <span>""</span>
       <span>liftString</span> <span>rev</span>
   <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Suppose we’d like to define a <code>gitRev</code> string that represents the current <code>git</code>
revision in the project repository. This can be done using an expression splice:
it is written using the <code>$(...)</code> syntax, and the content within <code>$()</code> is an
expression of type <code>Q Exp</code>, representing a compile-time computation that returns
an <code>Exp</code> value, which is, in this case, the current <code>git</code> revision as a string
literal.</p>
<p>Splice code lives in the <code>Q</code> monad, which manages the context for Template
Haskell and provides a rich set of interfaces. Inside <code>Q</code> we can query info
about datatypes or functions, allocate fresh identifiers, etc. Arbitrary <code>IO</code>
actions may also be run inside <code>Q</code>. Here, we run <code>git rev-parse HEAD</code> to obtain
the <code>git</code> revision and then return it. When GHC compiles this module, the splice
is replaced with a string literal, and compilation moves on.</p>
<p>So at first glance, Template Haskell is just about running user code at compile
time, what can go wrong? All is right for most developers, who compile to the
same platform they run GHC on, but there’s trouble ahead when you try to do
cross compilation…</p>
<h2>The what and why of cross compilation</h2>
<p>Suppose we’d like to write a Haskell app for an Android phone or a Raspberry
Pi. It’s possible to bootstrap a native GHC release on them and use it to
compile stuff, but given the limited hardware resources of these machines, it’s
wiser to run GHC on a proper x64 build server and emit code for these ARM
devices. When we do so, we’re performing <em>cross compilation</em>. Some terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>host</em> platform is where we run GHC to compile stuff.</li>
<li>The <em>build</em> platform is where we compile GHC. For simplicity, we assume
build=host and only use the host term from now on.</li>
<li>The <em>target</em> platform is where we run the compiled Haskell app. When
host=target, the GHC is a <em>native</em> GHC, otherwise it’s a <em>cross</em> GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a native GHC, Template Haskell isn’t a problem, since GHC can link and run its
emitted code just like native dynamic libraries. But this doesn’t work
out-of-the-box for a cross GHC.</p>
<p>Over the years, people have come up with different approaches to address the
cross compilation issue of Template Haskell, each coming with its own rough
edges; more details follow in later sections.</p>
<h2>Only run TH on the host platform</h2>
<p>If we can’t run emitted code, then how about we don’t run it at all and stay
with a cross GHC without TH support? We’ll preprocess the cross GHC input code,
strip usages of the Template Haskell extension, and replace all TH splices with
the expanded code. And the way to expand the splices would be… using a native
GHC to compile it!</p>
<p>There’s a GHC flag <code>-ddump-splices</code> which dumps the expanded splices code.
Unfortunately, the dump output has extra text decorations and isn’t proper Haskell
source code, so it takes more work to use the dumps. Here’s a list of known
implementations of the splice dump approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=Build/EvilSplicer.hs;h=e07034c5b05f47c316a1e68e6a85d54335c8e253;hb=aaa841e60a55524c3efb5e9783b8e6074d2413cc"><code>EvilSplicer</code></a> uses a <code>parsec</code>-based parser to process the dumps
for later consumption of cross GHC. It was used in the
<a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/"><code>git-annex</code></a> project until late 2018.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/zeroth"><code>ZeroTH</code></a> is a tool which does something similar, and includes a CLI
and <code>Cabal</code>-related helper functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform"><code>reflex-platform</code></a> uses a patched native GHC which dumps the
expanded splices as proper Haskell source code, and feeds into <a href="https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs">GHCJS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, making native/cross GHC work together is not trivial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> which can emit code for other platforms by simply
adding relevant CLI flags, a GHC installation can only emit code for a single
target platform configured at its build time. So two different GHC
installations must be managed in isolated places.</li>
<li>Native/cross GHC must have the same version and process the same build plan to
minimize the chance of emitting wrong code. Say package <code>foo</code> includes a TH
splice that uses package <code>bar</code>, if native/cross GHC sees different versions
(or even same version but different build plan) of <code>bar</code>, the splice behavior
could potentially differ, expanding into wrong code that may be silently
consumed by cross GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the complexity of the required hacks and GHC/Cabal’s lack of cross
compilation support, it’s common to use an external build system (e.g.
<a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>) to encapsulate this mechanism.</p>
<p>Other than saving dumps of expanded splices, there is another solution to only
run TH splice code on the host platform: the same GHC always compile everything
to both host/target code in one invocation! When running TH, we can just load
host code just like native GHC. This requires quite some customization of GHC
behavior and is only possible for 3rd-party compilers based on GHC API. In
fact, GHCJS used this approach in its earliest days.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of running TH on the host platform</h3>
<p>Running TH on the host platform works for pure splices, which can only do
things like reifying info and generating ASTs. It should also work pretty well
for side-effecting splices which reads files, spawns processes or fires
missiles, since the splice behavior should be just the same as when we use a
native GHC to compile stuff.</p>
<p>But is this the end of story? Not yet. Here’s one immediate problem: the
native/cross GHC may not consume the same Haskell sources despite our best
efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell modules may use the <code>CPP</code> extension with target-specific macros, so
when you compile for different targets, you see different top-level
definitions.</li>
<li>Cabal files may also check implementation/platform/etc, and end up with
different flags or even different modules to be consumed by GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problems above will likely trigger compile-time errors. And there’s an even
stealthier problem that may lead to generating incorrect code instead of a
crash: the architecture difference of host/target, e.g. word size or endianness.
For instance, a TH splice may make use of <code>sizeOf (undefined :: Int)</code>, which is
4 on 32-bit target platforms, and if the host platform is 64-bit, then the TH
splice will see 8, which sneaks into the emitted code without a single warning.</p>
<h2>Run TH code on the target platform</h2>
<p>As explained in earlier sections, vanilla GHC can only link and run host code.
Would it be possible to teach GHC to link and run target code? The answer is
yes. The key to supporting running non-native code is RPC (Remote Procedure
Calls). GHC needs to call into target code to obtain the splice expansion
result; the target code needs to call GHC to do reification. These calls are
achieved via exchanging serialized messages between GHC and the loaded splices.
Since there is a fixed set of operations allowed in the <code>Q</code> monad (as methods of
the <code>Quasi</code> class), the operations and the results can be encoded as a
serializable <code>Message</code> datatype.</p>
<p>This RPC approach to run TH code is standardized in the <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/compiler/external-interpreter">external
interpreter</a> feature. When running TH, GHC starts an
external process calls <code>iserv</code>, pipes messages to <code>iserv</code> and tells it to load
archives, objects, etc and link code. After a splice starts running in <code>iserv</code>,
<code>iserv</code> may send queries back to GHC and get results. Finally, the splice
expansion result is sent back to GHC.</p>
<p>The external interpreter opens up the possibility of using various emulators
(e.g. <code>wine</code> for windows, <code>node</code> for js/wasm or even <code>qemu</code> for exotic
platforms) to run target code for TH. GHC itself doesn’t need to care about how
the code is actually linked and run in <code>iserv</code>, and TH should work as long as
our target-specific <code>iserv</code> can properly process the messages.</p>
<p>This approach was pioneered by GHCJS, and later made it into upstream GHC by
7.10. Other than GHCJS, known users include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GHC itself, even in native GHC! But why bother? Well, suppose we’re compiling
a profiled library with TH usage. Since profiled code follows different
runtime conventions and links with profiled runtime, in the early days, a
profiled GHC executable was needed. Now, we can simply use a profiled <code>iserv</code>
executable, and avoid the extra profiling overhead in GHC.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix">haskell.nix</a>, which includes support for cross-compiling to
Windows via <code>wine</code> emulation of TH code.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@zw3rk">Mobile Haskell</a>, which are ARM-targetting GHC distributions.
They use Android/iOS emulators to set up the splice runtime environment. GHC
talks to an <code>iserv-proxy</code> process via pipes, and <code>iserv-proxy</code> merely relays
the messages to the real <code>iserv</code> program in the emulator via a socket.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/typelead/eta">Eta</a> Haskell-to-JVM compiler.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/Asterius">Asterius</a>, which uses <code>node</code> for running the WebAssembly &amp;
JavaScript code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros and cons of running TH on the target platform</h3>
<p>Compared to running TH on the host platform, there are a few benefits to
running it on the target platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>No host/target incoherence issues, as explained in earlier sections.</li>
<li>Less hacky and more standardized. Although upstream GHC won’t likely contain
<code>iserv</code> implementations for all interesting target platforms out there,
developers can just roll their own if needed.</li>
<li>Simpler, since there isn’t a bunch of hacks to be packaged via nix anymore,
and it works with vanilla <code>cabal</code>/<code>stack</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be tempting to announce TH for cross compilation is now a solved
problem! Turns out it’s not. Recall how TH enables running …</p></div></div></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Standing in line with other high-end brands, <em>“Less is better”</em> has always been the one principle that we can all observe in Apple’s branding and design. From their physical store layouts to their website and products including hardware and software, Apple has always emanated a sense of luxury in their aesthetic. And that’s what makes them stand out.</p>
<!--more--><p>What standards has Apple set for the world of design? Let’s take a close look at how they do it.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Web Design</strong></h2>
<p>Do you remember the first time you went on Apple’s website to check out their new iPhone? You were probably really quickly convinced by the clean typography, smooth animation flows, and high definition product images that immersed you by filling your screen… that you wanted one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple’s web design doesn’t just function, it wows.<img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png" alt="Apple iPad product images and descriptions clean white space and font" width="1383" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=692&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 692w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 1383w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2075&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2075w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2766&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2766w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=3458&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 3458w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=4149&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 4149w" sizes="(max-width: 1383px) 100vw, 1383px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>If we look at how Apple’s website has transformed over the years, we can see that minimalistic web design is one of its most consistent catches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their website focuses on clutterless single content areas that highlight one piece of content at a time with plenty of white space and wide margins. Not only is this design aesthetically pleasing, it is easy on the eyes and makes content easy to take in.</p>
<p>To make reading even lighter, Apple also uses simple headlines that show you the main idea of the paragraph without requiring you to read the paragraph.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png" alt="Apple homepage iPhone 12 Pro product image" width="1488" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=744&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 744w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 1488w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2232&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2232w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2976&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2976w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=3720&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 3720w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=4464&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 4464w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>On their homepage, it’s difficult to ignore the huge product image that appears as soon as you enter, filling your entire screen from edge to edge, immersing you in it. The reason behind this design choice is to prevent decision fatigue and give visitors room to breathe. Instead of pushing their products onto you all at once, they let you focus on one single product, one headline, and one catchy subheadline.</p>
<p>Unlike most other websites that use multiple, smaller product photos, Apple uses techniques that obey the principles of visual hierarchy. They use large images, high contrast and bold typefaces for emphasis, and maximize space around it to draw even more attention to the subject. That is why when you glance at the image above, ‘iPhone 12 Pro’ takes center stage before anything else.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Product Design</strong></h2>
<p><span>It’s no unpopular opinion that Apple products look AND feel luxurious, whether it’s the iPhone, Mac, iPad or Apple Watch. One of the most groundbreaking moments for Apple was when they launched the original Macbook Air in 2008. Their iconic </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ywa_EynjC8"><span>Envelope Ad</span></a><span> went viral because at the time, the Macbook Air was the thinnest laptop ever in the market.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When we look at their unrivaled history of success, we can’t help but wonder: What’s been keeping Apple products ahead of the rest all these years?</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=724&amp;height=483&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg" alt="an image of iphone" width="724" height="483" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=362&amp;height=242&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 362w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=724&amp;height=483&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 724w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=1086&amp;height=725&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 1086w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=1448&amp;height=966&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 1448w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=1810&amp;height=1208&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 1810w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=2172&amp;height=1449&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></span></p>
<p><span>Yes, Apple definitely has a strong focus on user experience, premium quality, practical design, and even tasking users’ feedback into consideration. But ask anyone what they think stands out about Apple products, and they’ll mention one thing </span><span>—</span> <em><span>simplicity</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The book </span><em><span>Steve Jobs Biography</span></em><span> written by Walter Isaacson highlights Apple’s emphasis on simplicity:</span></p>
<p><span><em>Jobs’ belief in the power of simplicity as a design precept reached its pinnacle with the three consumer device triumphs he produced beginning in 2001: the iPod, iPhone and iPad. He immersed himself daily in the design of the original iPod and its interface.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>His main demand was <strong>“Simplify!”</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em>He would go over each screen and apply a rigid test: If he wanted a song or a function, he should be able to get there in three clicks. And the click should be intuitive. If he couldn’t figure out how to navigate to something, or if it took more than three clicks, he would be brutal.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“There would be times when we’d wrack our brains on a user interface problem, and think we’d considered every option, and he would go, ‘Did you think of this?’” said Tony Fadell, the team leader.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“He’d redefine the problem or approach, and our little problem would go away.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>This is what makes Apple’s design unique. With Jobs’ hard focus on clean, simple, and sleek, iOS had started a big design wave </span><span>that, to this day, has Android operating systems scrambling to ride it.</span></p>
<p><span>When Apple launched the iPad 2 in Silicon Valley in 2011, Jobs said:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough - it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Today, it’s clear that Apple designers are continuing his legacy in keeping Apple at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. This is the reason why Apple’s design is great. Their products don't just look good, they’re designed in a way that thinks about the people they’re designed for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><span>Next Step for You</span></strong></h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>I really love C#. It's by far <a href="https://hjerpbakk.com/tag/csharp/">my favorite programming language</a>. And who wouldn't agree? I mean with a piffy, roll of the tounge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">Wikipedia description</a> like this, what is not to love?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, yeah", I hear you say dear reader. "I know C# is great to use if you want to write better Java apps, even so, this is the Bekk Functional advent calendar. What are you rambling about?"</p>
<p>I know you love your pure, scalable functions in <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming#Purity">Haskell</a> and your fancy web pages written in <a href="https://www.elm.christmas/2020">Elm</a>, but did you spot the magic word in the description above? It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... <strong>functional</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! As the late Sean Connery <a href="https://youtu.be/hKJZ9pzDMCk">said so excitedly</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://hjerpbakk.com/img/christmas/the-day-is-mine.jpeg" alt="The day is mine!"></p>
<p>C# is not only useful on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-5.0">backend</a>, while writing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/">iOS and Android apps</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-5.0">replacing JS in the browser</a> or as a <a href="https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script">scripting language</a>, it also becomes more and more functional-friendly with every new language version!</p>
<p>However, what does it mean to be a <em>functional-friendly</em> programming language?</p>
<h2>Functional advantages</h2>
<p>Enrico Buonanno argues in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-write-better-code/dp/1617293954/">Functional Programming in C#: How to write better C# code</a> that we should care about functional programming because it gives us the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power:</strong> We can get more done with less code. Functional programming raises the level of abstraction, allowing us to write high-level code while freeing us from low-level technicalities that add complexity but no value.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> A program written in the imperative style may work well in a single-threaded implementation but due to the mutable state that is in its nature, cause all sorts of bugs when concurrency comes in. Code in the functional style might offer better guarantees in concurrent scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> We spend more time maintaining and consuming existing code than writing new code, so it’s important that our code be clear and intention-revealing. As we learn to think functionally, achieving this clarity will become more natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>C# supports a lot of <a href="https://functionalprogrammingcsharp.com/functional-features-of-c-sharp">functional building blocks</a>, such as <em>function delegates</em>, <em>higher order functions</em>, <em>expressions instead of statements</em>, <em>method chaining</em>, <em>extension methods</em>, <em>yield</em>, <em>LINQ</em>, <em>tuples</em> and <em>local functions</em>. Despite all that, the core functional tenet of <em>immutability of data</em> has always been a C# pain point. Until now.</p>
<h2>Immutability in C#</h2>
<p>C# second greatest error<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> was to one-up Java and introduce the concept of properties as a first class language feature with the poorest defaults of all time: the default property syntax made it all too easy to create classes with mutable properties. The deed is as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://hjerpbakk.com/img/christmas/the-wolf.png" alt="Listen to the wolf"></p>
<p>Alas, premature aging can take its toll and we should've listened to the dog, hound, wolf or whatever, and make the <code>age</code> property immutable. It came with a cost however, amounting to a lot more work and boilerplate code. I mean, I got bored by just writing out this small example from the past:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>return</span> age<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#expression-body-definitions">C# 6</a> made the pit of success a bit deeper by introducing read-only properties using only a <code>get</code> accessor:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct">C# 7.2</a> made declaring our intent more explicit by allowing a <code>struct</code> to be marked as <code>readonly</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all well and good, yet consider when our class or struct has multiple readonly properties and we need to construct a new copy with an updated value in one or more of them. My head hurts just by thinking about it. The boilerplate has tested my Christmas spirit, why must we endure this error prone, manual waste? A better way must exist!</p>
<h2>Records in C# 9</h2>
<p>And finally this year, at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu3k2PJumfI">worst year ever</a>, it does! Microsoft bestowed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9">.Net 5 and C# 9</a> upon us, giving us my most requested feature: <em>language support for immutable data types</em>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#record-types">Record types</a>!</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>record</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> Age<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>record</code> is immutable in that none of the properties can be modified once it's been created. When we define a record type, the compiler provides several useful methods for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods for value-based equality comparisons</li>
<li>Override for <code>GetHashCode()</code></li>
<li>Copy and Clone members</li>
<li><code>PrintMembers</code> and <code>ToString()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like we're finally winning the war against boilerplate, and if we need to create a copy with an updated value, we can now easily use the <code>with</code> keyword:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> me <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>37</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>Person</span> meAYearOlder <span>=</span> <span>me</span> with <span>{</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>38</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With such quality functional features in C# like <em>immutable records</em>, not even time's inevitable flowing towards my 40th birthday and usage of 24(!) year old memes can break this aging developer's Christmas spirit!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I spent a large part of 2019 working with the distributed and decentralized web, especially IPFS, also known as the “Inter-Planetary File System”. I’ve written a few articles on the topic, on how you can host a web app on IPFS, one of which even ended up on the front page of HackerNews.</p><p>For about a year, I hosted my blog and other apps through an IPFS cluster. I wrote a utility for making pinning files easier on Pinata, a third-party cloud service for IPFS. I made some small contributions to the IPFS core projects. I built some projects with it, including one that I never released–nor fully completed–that used both IPFS and Ethereum. And I even gave a talk about hosting static web apps on IPFS at Node+JS Interactive last December in Montreal.</p><p>That all changed in the Spring of 2020. I called myself out of the distributed web.</p><p>My blog and other apps I built aren’t hosted on IPFS anymore. I don’t participate in those online communities anymore. I’ve stopped writing about the distributed and researching about it. I’ve shelved all my projects that were using those technologies.</p><p>I also updated my blog posts about IPFS adding a note that my blog isn’t hosted that way anymore. More than a few people asked me why, and I always gave the same answer: a mix of technical issues and mostly personal reasons. So, I think it’s time I explain the personal reasons.</p><p>First, I need to explain why I got involved with IPFS in the first place.</p><p>When I first read about IPFS, my mind immediately saw it as an exciting new platform I could build my apps for. The premise of a fully-decentralized platform included unlimited scalability, ultra-high availability and resiliency, no single points of failure, and resistance against attacks like DDoS.</p><p>Coming from a background in which I am always thinking about SLAs, number of nines of uptime, disaster recovery, etc, IPFS sounded like a dream platform that would magically solve all my concerns. And, aside from some performance issues at times, it did. Plus, the small engineer inside me was really excited about being able to play with a new, shiny toy, that had lots of hype around it!</p><p>What happened next for me was a reckoning with the reality of what many people behind the IPFS core project and the community around it saw: the dream of a radically open, unfiltered, and by-design un-censorable platform.</p><p>I have recently opened up about my experience, over a decade ago, with building an app with good intentions but that was then misused (<a href="https://withblue.ink/2020/09/24/that-time-i-accidentally-built-a-spying-app.html"><em>That time I accidentally built a spying app</em></a>). I learned early on in my life and (pre-)professional career about the importance of ethics in software development, and I am now a proponent of the idea that just because something <em>can</em> be built, it doesn’t mean it <em>should</em> be built.</p><p>And that brings me back to why, after spending some time in the world of the decentralized web, I have called myself out, and why I think that should things like IPFS actually become mainstream, they might cause more harm than good in the world.</p><p><strong>I have seen, and I am seeing every day, the dangers of completely unrestricted speech, and I don’t want to be the one enabling that.</strong></p><p>I know that last sentence is a strong ideological statement; some might call it a <em>political</em> statement, but for me it’s more than just political, which is often used to describe extemporary beliefs.</p><p>Many of you reading this will not agree with me, and that’s fine. I’m not going to try and change your beliefs with this blog post. Rather, I’m looking to explain why, while I respect that others might have differing opinions, I stopped doing anything that would actively advance a technology whose ethics I question. To put it in other terms: your freedom of speech isn’t my obligation to enable you and give you a platform.</p><p>In short, I think that while the Internet has helped the world in countless of ways, it has also brought out the worst in people.</p><p>I do believe we need some filters on the Internet. It’s not just about stopping criminal activities, terrorism and child pornography: while I am obviously unsupportive of all them, I also think they’re not the biggest dangers coming from the Internet (yet they’re a very convenient pretext for politicians).</p><p>Instead, I think that regular people’s writings on the Internet is hurting the world on a bigger scale. And the collective sentiment is often manipulated by some “agitators” that are exploiting anonymous online speech for their own agendas: that includes online militias–for example sponsored by foreign governments–whose goal is to destabilize a society.</p><p>In the last few years, completely unregulated online speech has given rise to fake news and conspiracy theories that have actually killed people. It’s offered a megaphone to those promoting dangerous ideas like white supremacy, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other anti-LGBTQ positions, and sometimes outright Nazism. It has tilted many democracies towards right-wing populism and fascism.</p><p>All these extreme ideas have divided societies and increased social tensions. And they’re responsible for a number of acts of terrorism which caused the death of too many people.</p><p>Given our experiences so far, there’s no sign that indicates that a fully decentralized and unrestrained web would be anything but a dangerous wild west.</p><p>In fact, despite being tightly centralized and controlled, social media companies are facing significant challenges regulating what people write on their platforms, and in fact they are usually at the center of every scandal of these years. Decentralization and less control won’t be the solution to this issue, but rather the opposite.</p><p>If you believe that I’m overthinking this, and that it’s not going to be bad <em>this time</em>, I urge you to think twice.</p><p>First, there’s no indication that a new Web would be better than the previous one just on virtue of being decentralized. The same actors that are using today’s Internet to wreak havoc around the world would not disappear in the new Internet, and actually, they could be even more unrestrained.</p><p>Second, while almost everyone in the communities supporting a distributed web are good people, with good intentions, seeing some names in there is concerning to me. Regarding IPFS, advocates (at least for a while) included people like Nick Lim of BitMitigate and VanwaNet, companies responsible for rescuing, among others, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattles-bitmitigate-now-protecting-pro-nazi-site-daily-stormer-web-attacks/">pro-nazi website</a> The Daily Stormer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/breaking-the-law-how-8chan-or-8kun-got-briefly-back-online/">and the platform</a> 8chan, a cesspool full of Nazi propaganda, child pornography, and other hate speech. Gatherings on 8chan have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan#2019_shootings">blamed</a> for at least three mass shootings in 2019 alone, including the one in the <a href="https://time.com/5648479/8chan-ban-new-zealand/">mosque in Christchurch</a>, all of them motivated by racial hatred.</p><p>The first real examples of the distributed web aren’t particularly encouraging either. Among some of the most popular apps (“popular” in relative terms, of course) for the distributed web is DTube, a sort of YouTube that is built on top of IPFS. As you can expect, the website is full of questionable content, including conspiracy theories, cryptocurrency scams, weapons, RT&nbsp;International’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/russia-disinformation-rt-nuanced-online-ofcom-fine">Russian propaganda</a>… and of course, porn.</p><p>In essence, if it’s true that <em>a good beginning makes a good ending</em>… with such a mixed beginning, the outlook isn’t too rosy.</p><p>I understand that my opinion is somehow a minority one, and people will continue to build IPFS and other technologies part of the distributed web. There’s also a chance they might become successful and potentially get mainstream adoption–although at this stage the barrier to entry is too high for the average user.</p><p>However, I feel that it’s my responsibility to not be helping to advance this technology and the beliefs of at least some advocates in the world of the distributed web hold. If the advancement occurs, it won’t be because of my help.</p><hr><p><em>PS: The idea that freedom of speech is an absolute right that should have (almost) no limitations is not a universal one. While that right is granted to people living in all democratic countries, outside of North America it’s accepted that such right comes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/world/europe/el-paso-shooting-freedom-of-speech.html">with limitations</a>, and usually that has roots in the history of those places.</em></p><p><em>For example, in Italy where I grew up, the same constitution that grants freedom of expression (speech, press, etc) also criminalizes “apology of fascism”, or propagating the ideas of fascism; it also sets other limits on speech that is hateful or discriminatory. Other European countries have similar laws, such as the outlawing of Nazi rhetoric and symbology in Germany.</em></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>It is well known that prime numbers are important for cryptography, although it has not always been true. The advent of primes came with several groundbreaking papers almost 50 years ago. Pioneers in introducing asymmetric cryptography, Whit Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, used results from number theory to build key agreement, encryption, and signatures. Prime numbers hold a very special position in number theory, and this carried over to cryptography.</p>
<h2>From Primes to Crypto</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols are typically working <em>modulo</em> some prime <em>p</em>. This can be likened to turning the number line into a coil, such that 0, <em>p</em>, 2<em>p</em>, etc. all join at the same place. From then on, whenever we add or multiply the number such that we go beyond <em>p</em>, we can simply remove as many multiples of <em>p</em> as necessary until we come between 0 and <em>p</em> again.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that we used a composite number instead, for example 12. Then 0 and 12 are "the same" in this situation, but that also means that 3 multiplied by 4 is ... 0! One of the intuitions when working with normal numbers is that if <em>ab</em> = 0, then either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> would have to be 0. Hence, when using composite numbers, there is simply stuff that no longer works the way we’re used to. Fortunately, this is not the case when using the primes — for instance 7 — as our so-called modulus.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves.png"></p>
<p>Let’s make a rule, and let’s call it <em>m</em>. We take the coil we just made from the number line, and since we can always reduce numbers to below <em>p</em>, we label our points on this circle from 0 to <em>p</em>-1. Given two points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the circle, we decided that the output of the rule <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) should be the point which is represented by the product <em>ab</em>, possibly after reducing modulo <em>p</em>. It may look like a very natural rule, but it is nonetheless a rule we just agreed on. If you play around with this rule a bit, you will notice some properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <em>a</em> = 1, then <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = <em>b</em> (and the other way around).</li>
<li>For any <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> not equal to 0, <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is never zero. So, if we removed 0 from the circle entirely, no harm would happen — the rule would still be well-defined.</li>
<li>For any nonzero <em>a</em>, there is always some <em>b</em> such that <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These nice properties — together with a property called associativity — are the properties we need to be able to do cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>Now focus on a particular number on the circle, and let’s call it <em>g</em>. If we take <em>m</em>(<em>g</em>, <em>g</em>), or — to return to the more usual notation — <em>g²</em>, we will reach a new point on the circle. We can continue this process and compute <em>g</em>³, <em>g</em>⁴, etc. At some point, we will reach 1. All the points we have visited in this process are members of the set of numbers <em>generated</em> by <em>g</em>, and if the number of points on the coil is a large prime, then we have a very good candidate for doing cryptography, for example Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Let <em>h</em> be some number in this set generated by <em>g</em>. That means that <em>h</em> = <em>g</em>ᵉ for some exponent <em>e</em>. If it is easy to find this <em>e</em> from <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, we would have trouble. Fortunately, it turns out that if we use <em>large enough</em> primes, then this <em>e</em> appears to be very difficult to find.</p>
<h2>From Coils to Curves</h2>
<p>Coiling up the number line is not the only way of finding suitable primitives for cryptography. Let’s make a new rule. Instead of using a circle like we did in the previous section, we consider the following equation:</p>
<p><em>y</em>² = <em>x</em>³ + <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are fixed constants.</p>
<p>If we graph this in our usual coordinate system, it may look like this curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves2.png"></p>
<p>We will now make a rule on how to combine two distinct points <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> on this curve. The agreed upon notation is to call this rule addition, but we will have to define what we mean by that. Programming languages often include this mental concept as operation overloading. Draw the straight line between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. It will intersect at a third point, say, <em>R</em>. This could have been a nice candidate for <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>, but since we are making the rules, let’s make this a bit more interesting. Draw a vertical line through <em>R</em>. It will intersect the curve on the opposite side of the <em>x</em>-axis, and we define this point as <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>. Just as before, this is a rule we’re deciding here and now. However, this also turns out to be a very useful rule, with the same properties as before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having the point 1 on the circle, we imagine a point infinitely far up. (Remember what you see when looking at railway tracks: parallel lines actually meet beyond the horizon, at infinity.) So, now the line intersecting <em>R</em> and <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em> is indeed also intersecting a third point: the point at infinity. This can be made precise, but requires maths from algebraic geometry, which is far beyond the scope of this blog post. This point at infinity has all the same properties as 1 had above.</li>
<li>For any point <em>S</em> on the curve, there is always a point <em>T</em> such that we get a line intersecting <em>S</em>, <em>T</em> and the point at infinity. This means that for any point <em>S</em>, we can find a point we can call -<em>S</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can test this rule interactively in a simple <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/ukhajwzs">GeoGebra demonstration</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/ec_group_law.gif"></p>
<p>We just assumed that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> were distinct. If <em>P</em> = <em>Q</em>, then we simply use the tangent to the curve at point <em>P</em> instead, and proceed as before.</p>
<p>In particular, take a point <em>G</em>, and compute 2<em>G</em> = <em>G</em> + <em>G</em>, 3<em>G</em>, 4<em>G</em>, etc. Eventually, we reach the point at infinity, and then back to <em>G</em>. We have now spent about 1000 words of this blog post getting here, just to do the same as we did above, and what was the point? Above, we said that computing exponents are secure if the primes were large enough. It turns out that "large enough" is currently about 3072 bits, or a number with approximately 925 digits. That is somewhat strenuous even for a computer, but the elliptic curve version only requires us to work on numbers of size 256 bits, or 77 digits, which is far more efficient.</p>
<h2>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange</h2>
<p>The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol is widely used today, and its instantiation using elliptic curves is ranked as the best choice in modern cryptographic protocols like TLS and SSH. The protocol is fairly simple. The public information is an elliptic curve <em>E</em> and a generator <em>G</em> for the points on this curve. One party, Alice, samples a random integer <em>a</em> and computes a point <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>G</em>. Another party, Bob, samples a random integer <em>b</em> and computes <em>B</em> = <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange the values <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and compute the shared key <em>K</em> = <em>b</em> <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>B</em> = <em>a</em> <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. As long as both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> stay secret, even when an attacker knows <em>G</em>, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, then the key is secure.</p>

<p>To achieve long-term security, to protect previous messages in the case where someone’s secret keys are leaked after the fact, Alice and Bob can do an ephemeral key-exchange every time they communicate. If <em>a</em> and <em>A</em> is Alice’s long term key pair where <em>A</em> is public to everyone, and similar for Bob, they can run the following protocol to agree upon a one-time session-key. Alice samples a random integer <em>c</em> and computes <em>C</em> = <em>c</em> <em>G</em>, and Bob samples a random integer <em>d</em> and computes <em>D</em> = <em>d</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>, and compute the shared key as (<em>a</em> <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> <em>d</em> )<em>G</em>.</p>
<p>The interested reader can check out this <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/qJBI0_2lsGP">simple example written in Go</a>. Are you able to extend the basic protocol to the ephemeral key-exchange on behalf of Alice and Bob?</p>
<p>We finally point out that this protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, and we need to also send signatures computed on the messages to ensure that the communication is authentic. Are you able to attack the protocol as described above, when signatures are not used? If you found these problems interesting, we encourage you to check out similar challenges at <a href="https://cryptohack.org/challenges/ecc/">cryptohack.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Curves</h2>
<p>Not all elliptic curves are suitable for cryptography. There could also be power in choosing a curve and the distinguished base point(s). Hence, implementations tend to choose among a small number of well-known curves. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final">maintains a list</a> of recommended curves; P-256 is perhaps the most popular among these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, there is also the <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">SafeCurves</a> collection proposed by Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange. In particular, their Curve25519 has proven to be a popular choice.</p>
<p>Elliptic curve libraries will typically have tailored support for certain curves.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a name="20201204_Modern_TPMS_Sensors_Lets_try_a_DoS_attack"><b>Modern TPMS Sensors: Let's try a DoS attack</b></a></p><p>
TPMS (Tire-pressure monitoring system) sensors have been researched extensively
many years ago, they periodically transmit the tire pressure, temperature
and a unique ID which can be misused for tracking a vehicle. But there is
another aspect: modern TMPS sensors also have a receiver which is typically
used to trigger the data transmission when a new TPMS sensor is presented to
the vehicle ("learning procedure").
</p>

<p>
Here in Europe TPMS sensors usually transmit on the 433 MHz ISM band. The
receiver operates on 125 kHz, very similar to LF RFID. A simple way to make
use of the receiver is just to look for the presence of the 125 kHz carrier
and then trigger data transmission. Current sensors are usually more evolved
and use a modulated carrier which contains command packets and only if the
correct command is received data transmission is triggered.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a receiver you can do of course more than just trigger
data transmission: For example there might be support for different
commands, some sensors even allow firmware updates this way.
</p>

<p>
One such command which is typically supported is switching the sensor into
"Shipping" mode. Why would you need that? When the sensor is operating
normally it waits for motion (there is an acceleration/shock sensor inside)
and only starts periodic data transmission when the wheel is rotating. This
is used to safe battery life. When the TPMS sensor is not yet mounted in the
tire it should not react on motion, that’s why there is this "Shipping" mode.
In this mode the sensor only wakes up every few seconds and looks if there
is a 125 kHz signal, if yes it checks for a valid command, for example the
command to trigger data transmission which usually also leaves "Shipping"
mode and switches the sensor into normal operation.
</p>

<p>
This "Shipping" mode can be misused: If you can switch a TPMS sensor of a
vehicle’s wheel into "Shipping" mode the sensor will no longer transmit data
and the vehicle's tire pressure control light will go on after a while.
Just to make it clear: This warning light is annoying to the driver, it
does not affect safety of the car because the deactivated TMPS sensor has
not affected the actual tire pressure.
</p>

<p>
I have looked at a few TPMS sensors for different cars if this really works,
I choose sensors for BMW and Ford cars. Please note that most certainly
other car manufactures are affected too, mainly because there are only a
few manufactures of TPMS sensors which deliver their sensors to various
car manufactures. My choice for BMW and Ford came from the fact that I
found lots of cheap, used sensor for those cars.
</p>

<p>
Also I only looked at "OEM" sensors for BMW and Ford, which means that those
sensors are mounted by the car manufacturer. There are also so called
"Universal" sensors which are typically mounted by tire dealers, there
are some notes about them at the end of this text.
</p>

<p>
It is quite easy to build a tool for transmitting data on 125 kHz: There
is this cheap EL-50448 TMPS sensor activation tool which only transmits a
carrier without modulation. However the hardware can easily be modified
to modulate the carrier: Most of the time OOK (On-Off Keying) is used
for communication, which means that the carrier is just turned on and off.
The EL-50448 uses a power driver with an unused "enable" pin to generate
the carrier, you can use this "enable" pin to modulate the carrier. The
data rate is slow, a frequently used rate is 3900 baud.  Most of the time
Manchester encoding of the data bits is used, which means that the carrier
changes twice as much (7800 changes per second). This is nothing special
and can be done with probably any microcontroller you prefer to use. The
hardware costs for such a setup are below EUR 20, the transmission range
is about 20 centimeters.
</p>

<p>
How can you find the command to switch to Shipping" mode? Brute force by
trying all possible commands is only an option if the command is short.
The reason is that the sensor only looks for the LF 125 kHz signal every
few seconds. If the command is not longer than two bytes brute force is
possible (it takes a few days), for longer commands it is impractical.
Please note that you also have to find a way to detect if the command you
send causes a reaction of the TPMS sensor, e.g. by monitoring the power
consumption of the sensor or receiving the 433 MHz data signal (which of
course only works if the command you send causes a data transmission).
</p>

<p>
Another option is looking at those TPMS tools which tire dealers and
car repair workshops use to check TPMS sensors. Some of those tools
might support switching a TPMS sensor into "Shipping" mode.
</p>

<p>
Those are the results I found (I won't go into the details to avoid misuse):
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>BMW:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. Also if the sensor detects a
  fast pressure change (e.g. by inflating the tire) the sensor leaves
  "Shipping" mode. The command length is four bytes so brute force is no option. 

</li>

<li><b>Ford:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" (the same manufacture as above for the BMW sensor) can be switched
  into "Shipping" mode, it is the same command as used by the BMW sensor
  from above. The deactivated TPMS sensor can be activated again with a
  different command.
  
  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "B" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. The command in this case is
  only two bytes and I tried all combinations which resulted in several more
  "interesting" commands, a few examples:


    <ul>
<li>
      It is possible to completely turn off the TPMS sensor. In this case it
      will no longer react on anything, you have to break open the sensor
      case and apply a hardware reset or disconnect the battery to reactivate
      it again.
</li>

<li>
      It is possible to switch the sensor into continuous "carrier transmit"
      mode on 433 MHz. In this mode the sensor will continuously transmit
      the 433 MHz carrier until the battery is empty or you apply a hardware
      reset (see above), it will not react on anything else. There are two
      other similar commands which transmit on the upper and lower shifted
      frequency (the sensor uses FSK modulation, Frequency Shift Keying, when
      transmitting data).
</li>
</ul>      

  Those examples show that it is basically possible to destroy this specific
  sensor by transmitting the appropriate command. Also if the sensor is in
  "carrier transmit" mode it probably disturbs the remote control car
  key fob which usually uses the same frequency as the TPMS sensor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have to be close to the sensor to send those LF 125 kHz signals but it
only takes a few seconds to send the signal. Using a larger antenna (which is
basically a coil) for the transmitter, e.g. large enough to fit in a suitcase,
might extend the transmission range to more than a meter. 
</p>

<p>
How can those problems be avoided? This is actually quite easy, the command
to switch into "Shipping" mode should not be allowed if the measured tire
pressure is above a certain limit, which means that the sensor is mounted in
the tire of a vehicle. This also applies to those other commands of the sensor
from manufacturer "B" which are probably some kind of factory test or developer
commands. Please note that during my tests the commands I described were
possible even when the measured tire pressure was in the range of a typical
vehicle wheel.
</p>

<p>
I contacted the car manufactures (BMW and Ford) before I published this
article, this is the experience I made:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>BMW:</b>
  The contact information for reporting security issues can be found on
  the BMW website. I had a phone call with the responsible person within
  a few days after reporting the issue. BMW already knew the problem, they
  found it during an internal review. Their latest TPMS sensors have fixed
  the issue by blocking certain commands if the tire pressure is above a
  certain limit.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Ford:</b>
  I wasn't able to find a security contact on the website of Ford Germany
  so I contacted the person responsible for "Public Relation". He promised
  to look for someone who takes care of the issue I reported, after several
  days I got a reply that it is possible to disturb the TPMS system due to
  the nature of radio transmission and that this is a known problem. I wasn't
  able to communicate directly with the responsible person and I then replied
  that the reported issue is not about disturbance but a "Denial of Service"
  and that it is even possible to destroy a certain TPMS sensor used in Ford
  cars. I didn't receive any further information about the security issue, I
  notified them again after several weeks that I am now going to publish
  the issue which was acknowledged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some notes about those "Universal" sensors tire dealers normally use: Those
sensors are "Universal" because they can be programmed for different car
models. The main benefit for the tire dealer is that only a few different
kind of "Universal" sensors have to be on stock, it’s not necessary to have
lots of different "OEM" TPMS sensors for every possible car model lying
around. The programming of those …</p></div></td></div></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/?resellerType=home">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> and original Raspberry Pi both have a 32-bit ARM architecture which many projects have dropped support for. So when I saw that <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4530">containerd recently merged a fix</a> for building containerd on armv6, started to think what I could do with it.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, a user of the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd project</a> which runs very well on VPSes, RPi 3 and RPi4 asked me whether it could work on the Zero and I told him it was not practical or worth his time. After all, an RPi4 with 2GB of RAM, 4 Cores and much faster I/O is only 25GBP/EUR/USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd is OpenFaaS</a>, but for a single node, and designed for those who don't want to pay for and manage an entire Kubernetes cluster, GitOps, service-mesh, and IngressController just to deploy a few simple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My past experiences told me that it would be a challenge to get the zero working. It has such a paltry amount of memory available and its I/O is really slow. Still, sometimes it's fun to do things that we shouldn't. Had I been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">"nerd sniped"</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/homepage-9df4b/static/1dfa03d09c1f3e446e8d936dfb92267f/8924f/6b0defdbbf40792b64159ab8169d97162c380b2c_raspberry-pi-zero-1-1755x1080.jpg" width="60%">
&gt; The RPi Zero originally released in 2015.
</p><p>In this post I'll show you what you need to do to deploy functions through the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">OpenFaaS CLI</a> and be able to invoke them, including multi-arch builds. At the end of the post I'll explain what the limitations are and whether we should leave the Raspberry Pi Zero with those fond memories we have of it when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">released in 2015</a>, 5 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walk-through</h2>
<h3 id="prereqs">Pre-reqs</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
<li>Ethernet adapter and USB &lt;&gt; USB A micro shim</li>
<li>16-32GB class 10 SD card</li>
<li>MicroUSB power adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card, and then create an <code>ssh</code> file in the <code>/boot/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Power up the Raspberry Pi and ssh to it with <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installgo">Install go</h3>
<p>You can install Go from a package manager, but the version is likely to be rather old. Fortunately the Go team still ship a binary for armv6:</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH="armv6l"
echo "Downloading Go"

curl -SLsf https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-$ARCH.tar.gz --output /tmp/go.tgz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go/
sudo tar -xvf /tmp/go.tgz -C /usr/local/go/ --strip-components=1

export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>You now have Go installed, run <code>go version</code> to see it working.</p>
<h3 id="buildcontainerd">Build containerd</h3>
<p>faasd uses containerd rather than Docker, but there are no official binaries for any of the ARM CPUs, so we have to build them from source.</p>
<p>For armv7 and ARM64, you can use my repo <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm">alexellis/containerd-arm</a>. It's my hope to see ARM support upstreamed, but having spoken on several occasions to the containerd team, it seems very unlikely that we will see this happen.</p>
<p>On my first attempt of building I got the following error:</p>
<pre><code>+ bin/containerd
# github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd/containerd
/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/link: running gcc failed: fork/exec /usr/bin/gcc: cannot allocate memory
make: *** [Makefile:188: bin/containerd] Error 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPi Zero and the largest RPi 1 only has 512MB of RAM and I slowly watched the RAM being eaten up with <code>watch -n "free -h"</code>.. I should have remembered this.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the battle scars and knew what I had to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1M &amp;&amp;\
  sudo mkswap /swapfile &amp;&amp; \
  sudo swapon /swapfile
</code></pre>
<p>This creates 1GB of swap, on the SD card.. which already has terrible I/O, but it may just work.</p>
<p>The other trick you may have seen me talk about is adding <code>gpu_mem=16</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. It seems pointless changing the split on an 8GB RPi4, but for our RPi Zero, we need every MB we can get.</p>
<p>Second time lucky?</p>
<p>No. It failed again due to some missing libraries. I reminded myself to read <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-containerd">BUILDING.md</a> from the containerd repo. After adding libseccomp and a few other packages, it started to move along again.</p>
<pre><code>make
+ bin/ctr
+ bin/containerd
+ bin/containerd-stress
+ bin/containerd-shim
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v1
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
+ binaries
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if it was 10 minutes or over an hour, but it was slow progress.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>sudo make install</code> and copied the systemd unit file into place with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't want to start containerd at this time, to save on memory for the next task.</p>
<h3 id="buildfaasd">Build faasd</h3>
<p>The faasd Makefile needed a patch because it was set to cross-compile to armv7, but we needed armv6.</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: dist
dist:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -mod=vendor -ldflags $(LDFLAGS) -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/faasd-armhf
</code></pre>
<p>This took so long to build on the zero that I gave up and built it on my Intel NUC. Fortunately Go is very good as cross-compiling, especially when linking into C/C++ libraries is disabled with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0</code>.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>scp</code> to copy the binary to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp faasd-armhf /usr/local/bin/faasd
cd go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>The final step was to install faasd which creates two systemd unit files:</p>
<ul>
<li>faasd - for the OpenFaaS core services</li>
<li>faasd-provider - for the provider that supports CRUD and Invoke operations</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/faasd-install.jpg" alt="faasd-install"></p>
<h3 id="unexpectedissues">Unexpected issues</h3>
<p>I tried to log in with <code>faas-cli login</code>, but it didn't work. I saw a number of errors in the logs <code>sudo systemctl journalctl -u faasd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dec 03 23:18:49 zero-dns default:basic-auth-plugin[13218]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
Dec 03 23:18:50 zero-dns containerd[12169]: time="2020-12-03T23:18:50.338589900Z" level=info msg="starting signal loop" namespace=default path=/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/default/gateway pid=13324
Dec 03 23:18:52 zero-dns default:gateway[13335]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that out of nats, prometheus, and the openfaas gateway, the openfaas basic-auth plugin only nats was available for armv6. It seems that projects really have moved on and left armv6 behind.</p>
<h3 id="thenihadanidea">Then I had an idea</h3>
<p>What if we didn't run the whole OpenFaaS stack at all, but just the <code>faasd-provider</code>? It would allow this tiny device to support all the CRUD operations on functions, and invocations, but nothing more.</p>
<p>The provider seemed to be running well, and responding to <code>faas-cli</code> commands:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/provider.png" alt="provider"></p>
<p>We'd lose the queue and async invocations, lose the UI, lose the metrics, but we could still deploy functions and invoke them.</p>
<p>It was already very late by this point so I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<h3 id="inthemorning">In the morning</h3>
<p>I powered up the RPi zero and tried deploying a container directly to the faasd endpoint, and it worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/deploy.jpg" alt="deploy"></p>
<p>Now, I had to make a few changes. Rather than building with the OpenFaaS watchdog in the container, I just used a Dockerfile and a plain Go HTTP server.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p>Dockerfile</p>

faas-cli deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Using the PC means we can cross-compile the Go HTTP server and push a multi-arch image to the container registry. The new <code>faas-cli publish</code> command comes in handy for this and can accept a list of architectures.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy</code> command talks to the remote machine over REST and tells it to deploy a function. The server-side handler <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/pkg/provider/handlers/deploy.go">deploy.go</a> pulls the image into containerd and starts executing it as a container.</p>
<h3 id="onemorething">One more thing</h3>
<p>When I say that it worked. I should clarify that I'd forgotten to deploy CNI - the networking layer required for faasd and containerd.</p>
<p>I saw this error by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/DEV.md">I'd documented all the steps required for a manual installation</a>, but somehow forgot this was needed.</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH=arm
export CNI_VERSION=v0.8.5

sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin

# Make a config folder for CNI definitions

{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "type": "loopback"
}

</code></pre>
<p>Just changing "ARCH" to "arm" was enough to make it work. So the CNI project are still <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml">building the plugins against armv6</a> for the time being.</p>

<p>Then it was a case of simply running <code>faas-cli deploy</code> again, and finally, it actually worked.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text" v-pre=""><p>Here are few differences between using <code>let</code> and <code>var</code>:</p>
<h3>1. Redeclaration:</h3>
<p>In strict mode, <code>var</code> will let you re-declare the same variable in the same scope while <code>let</code> throws a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>
<pre><code>'use strict';
var foo = "foo1";
var foo = "foo2"; // No problem, 'foo' is replaced.

let bar = "bar1";
let bar = "bar2"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'bar' has already been declared
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Creating global object property:</h3>
<p><code>let</code>, in contrast to <code>var</code>, doesn't make a property on the global object:</p>
<pre><code>var foo = "Foo";  // globally scoped
let bar = "Bar"; // globally scoped

console.log(window.foo); // Foo
console.log(window.bar); // undefined
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Scoping rules:</h3>
<p>The most important difference is the scoping rules. Variables declared by <code>var</code> keyword are scoped to the immediate function body while <code>let</code> variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block meant by <code>{ }</code>.</p>
<pre><code>function run() {
  var foo = "Foo";
  let bar = "Bar";

  console.log(foo, bar); // Foo Bar

  {
    let baz = "Bazz";
    console.log(baz); // Bazz
  }

  console.log(baz); // ReferenceError
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p>The motivation behind why let keyword was introduced with the language was function scope is confusing and was one of the main sources of bugs in JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code>var funcs = [];
// let's create 3 functions
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
  // and store them in funcs
  funcs[i] = function() {
    // each should log its value.
    console.log("Value: " + i);
  };
}
for (var j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {
  // and now let's run each one to see
  funcs[j]();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>Value: 3</code> was output to console each time <code>funcs[j]();</code> was used since anonymous functions were bound to the same variable.</p>
<p>Developers needed to make immediately invoked functions to catch correct value from the loops yet that was also hairy.</p>
<h3>4. Hoisting:</h3>
<p>While variables declared with <code>var</code> keyword are hoisted (initialized with undefined before the code is run) which implies they are accessible in their enclosing scope even before they are declared:</p>
<pre><code>function run() {
  console.log(foo); // undefined
  var foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p><code>let</code> variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. Accessing them before the initialization brings about a <code>ReferenceError</code>. Variable said to be in "temporal dead zone" from the beginning of the block until the initialization is handled.</p>
<pre><code>function checkHoisting() {
  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
  let foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

checkHoisting();
</code></pre>

<h3 id="preword">Preword</h3>

<p>I often reference the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">manpages</a> when giving a development
presentation or talk, but I’ve only recently come to realize how few people are both <em>comfortable</em>
with the <code>man</code> interface and adept at discovering information through it.</p>

<p>This post is my attempt to share some of the tricks and techniques I’ve picked up over years of
reading manpages.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap">A Quick Recap</h2>

<p>The manpages (short for “manual pages”) are the oldest and longest-running documentation collection
on *nix, stemming back to the
<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">first edition of the Unix Programmer’s Manual</a>
in 1971.</p>

<p>On a modern system, the <code>man</code> command is the most common way to access the manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># access the first manpage named "time", which happens to be time(1)</span>
man <span>time</span>

<span># access a specific section's "time", in this case the C time function</span>
man 2 <span>time</span>

<span># attempt to access a nonexistent "time" in section 5</span>
man 5 <span>time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because the manpages were originally published on paper, they were (and continue to be) typeset with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff"><code>troff</code></a> on most systems. Today, the <code>man</code> command (and other
manpage readers) invoke <code>troff</code> internally and pipe the output to the user’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager">pager</a> (like <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, a very simple manpage reader (which only works with section 1) can be implemented with
just three commands pipelined together:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>myman <span>{</span>
    <span># `-t` and `-e`: run `tbl` and `eqn` on the input, for tables and equations</span>
    <span># `-mandoc`: use a set of troff macros specifically for manpages</span>
    <span># `-Tutf8`: output UTF-8 text rather than PostScript</span>
    <span>gunzip</span> &lt; /usr/share/man/man1/<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>.1.gz"</span> | groff <span>-t</span> <span>-e</span> <span>-mandoc</span> <span>-Tutf8</span> | less
<span>}</span>

myman gcc
myman <span>ls</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from their simplicity and adherence to the UNIX philosophy, <code>man</code> and the manpages serve a
number of important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a categorization: section 1 is for system commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library
functions, and so forth. This categorization is followed both by the system itself (which populates
several of the sections) and by programs installed by the user or package manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide offline documentation: <code>man</code> doesn’t require an internet connection, and can provide
much of the documentation that an internet search would yield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They offer <em>canonical</em> information: searching for a command or function online might tell you
whether it exists, but won’t tell you the flags, arguments, or behavior specific to your system.
For example, <code>man ls</code> will tell you whether your system’s <code>ls</code> is BSD or GNU (and the differences
therebetween). The manpages (on Linux) will also tell you which feature macros you’ll need to define
in a C program in order to use a function (or a variant of a function).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s move on to some techniques.</p>

<h2 id="colorized-manpages">Colorized manpages</h2>

<p>One of the simplest things you can do to enhance the readability of manpages within <code>man</code> is to
colorize the pager’s output:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/gcc_man.png" alt="A colorized version of `man gcc`"></p>

<p>In <code>less</code>, this is accomplished by setting the <code>LESS_TERMCAP_*</code> environment variables to your
preferred ANSI color codes. Here are the variables you can set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LESS_TERMCAP_mb <span># blinking mode (not common in manpages)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_md <span># double-bright mode (used for boldface)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_me <span># exit/reset all modes</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_so <span># enter standout mode (used by the less statusbar and search results)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_se <span># exit standout mode</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_us <span># enter underline mode (used for underlined text)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_ue <span># exit underline mode</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may be able to set others corresponding to the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/termutils/manual/termcap-1.3/html_chapter/termcap_5.html">termcap capability names</a>,
but the variables above should cover all of your manpage needs.</p>

<p>By way of example, here is the <code>bash</code> function I use to colorize my manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>man<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>env</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_mb</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_md</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_me</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_se</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_so</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;44;33m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_ue</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_us</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;32m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    man <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that you don’t need to use escape sequences as above — <code>tput</code> will work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="other-sections">Other sections</h2>

<p>I mentioned some of the big sections above: 1 for system commands, 2 for system calls, and so on.</p>

<p>90% of <code>man</code> lookups will be in those three, but there are a few lesser-known sections that can also
be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 4</code> - Special files and devices</p>

    <p>On Linux, section 4 is used to document special files, usually representing some aspect of
  the machine or its peripherals. For example, <code>man 4 mem</code> will tell you how to use the
  <code>/dev/mem</code>, <code>/dev/kmem</code>, and <code>/dev/port</code> files to read from and write to the system’s main
  memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 5</code> - Configuration files and formats</p>

    <p>You probably know the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, but do you know how its format is specified?
  <code>man 5 shadow</code> will tell you that. Similarly, <code>man 5 deb</code> describes the <code>.deb</code> package format,
  and <code>man 5 ppm</code> lists the spec for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PPM images</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man Np</code> - POSIX pages</p>

    <p>These pages come in handy for contrasting POSIX behavior with the system’s behavior.</p>

    <p>Some examples:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span># compare the system ls (on Linux, GNU) to the POSIX ls behavior</span>
  man 1 <span>ls
  </span>man 1p <span>ls</span>

  <span># compare the read syscall to the POSIX read function</span>
  <span># note the categorization: POSIX read is a function, not a syscall!</span>
  man 2 <span>read
  </span>man 3p <span>read</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-and-navigating">Searching and navigating</h2>

<p>Like colorization, searching is more of a general <code>less</code> feature than one specific to <code>man</code>. That
being said, <code>less</code>’s searching and navigating features can make browsing the manpages a much faster
and more pleasant experience.</p>

<p>Searches in <code>less</code> can be forwards or backwards, using the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands respectively. The
search syntax is mostly POSIX ERE, but with some additions (<code>man less</code> has the details!).</p>

<p>For example, to find the first instance of “x86” in <code>man gcc</code> (watch the bottom of the screen for
the search prompt):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM.png">
</a></p>

<p>Observe that instances of the search term are highlighted with the standout colors from before.</p>

<p>Once a search term is entered, its results can be navigated via the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> commands, which
move forwards and backwards in the results list respectively. For example, going through all
of the results for “Windows”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX.png">
</a></p>

<p>When the last result has been jumped to, the statusbar changes to “Pattern not found”. Once that
happens, as in the video above, previous results can be returned to by hitting <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>Even this can be simplified: the <code>&amp;</code> command can be used to display only lines that match the given
pattern. For example, retrieving every line that contains either “ARM” or “ABI”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm.png">
</a></p>

<p>The effect is more dramatic when searching for the definition of a flag (in this case <code>-D</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn.png">
</a></p>

<p>These commands are just the tip of the iceberg — <code>less</code> supports searching multiple files at
once, jumping around scopes (opening and closing parentheses, braces, brackets), and marking the
current location for later return. Each of these is documented on the help screen, which you can
get to in any <code>less</code> session via the <code>h</code> command:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB.png">
</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Before picking up these tricks (especially searching), the manpages were an item of last resort
for me: I would search the internet or ask a friend, with mixed results. I had no real idea how to
use <code>less</code>, and would just clumsily page around until I found what I was looking for. More often
than not, I would give up entirely.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the manpages (and the <code>man</code> interface) are not perfect — there’s no
hyperlinking or real cross-referencing, and the entire corpus is written in a 45+ year old
typesetting language designed for <em>physical</em> output, not display in a virtual terminal.</p>

<p>That being said, they’re a <em>fantastic</em> initial resource for pretty much anything concerning your
system — they remain up-to-date (unlike blogs and articles), they’re accurate and concise, and
they’re <em>very</em> UNIX-y (text files and pipelines!).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <!-- Main content -->
                    <p>My previous development laptop was an <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/CA/content/series/acerchromebookr11">Acer R11</a> chromebook. I always ran it in <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_mode.md">developer mode</a> with all the Linux packages I needed installed via <a href="https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew">chromebrew</a>. This setup worked great except for GUI programs, as (at the time), the built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">Wayland</a> server on the chromebook was not exposed to the user in a meaningful way. I relied on an internal tool from Google called <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/HEAD/vm_tools/sommelier/">sommelier</a> to translate X11 calls to the internal Wayland server. None of this was ideal, but with a lot of scripts and aliases, I made it work.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to remove the locked-down ChromeOS all together, and set the laptop up with <a href="https://galliumos.org/">GalliumOS</a> so it can be used as a lightweight code-review machine with access to some useful tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> and <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. This whole process is actually fairly easy, and a good way to breathe new life in to an old chromebook. This guide will be R11-specific, but the process doesn’t vary too wildly between models.</p>

<h2 id="developer-mode">Developer mode</h2>

<p>A standard feature on chromebooks is “developer mode”. This is a hidden boot mode that is designed to give <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">ChromiumOS</a> contributors and Google developers access to debug tools when testing new OS builds. Along with debug tools, this mode also exposes a Linux terminal with root access to the user via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-&gt;</kbd>. On an extremely locked down system like a chromebook, this terminal access exposes a lot of new capability. For this use case, we will only use it to modify the system bootloader.</p>

<p>To enable developer mode, simply press <kbd>Esc</kbd> + <kbd>Refresh</kbd> + <kbd>Power</kbd>, and let the chromebook reboot. Once the recovery screen pops up, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>, and the device is now in developer mode.</p>

<h2 id="write-protection">Write protection</h2>

<p>This step will void your device’s warranty. Chromebooks are able to handle anything you throw at them. Even if you were to delete important system files to the point the device can no longer boot, hopping in to recovery mode can reset the device to a working state. This works via ChromeOS’s write protect mechanism. All important files are protected by hardware-enforced write protection. Since the process of loading a new operating system onto the device involves overwriting important system files (like the BIOS), we must physically disable write protection.</p>

<p>Luckily, on the Acer R11, this process is very simple. Firstly, unscrew the laptop’s bottom plate to expose the motherboard (some screws are hidden under rubber feet). With the backplate off, you will find a screw that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://retrylife.ca/assets/images/arcer_r11_screw.jpg" alt="R11 write protect screw"></p>

<p>The screw is hard to miss, it is beside the WIFI card, an has an arrow pointing to it. Simply remove it, and put the laptop back together. You now have a fully unlocked device.</p>

<h2 id="flashing-a-custom-bootloader">Flashing a custom bootloader</h2>

<p><a href="https://mrchromebox.tech/">Mr Chromebox</a>, a well known person in the world of Chromebook modification, provides and maintains a very easy to use shell script that handles bootloader modifications automatically. To use this tool, open up the ChromeOS terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-&gt;</kbd>), log in with the username <code>chronos</code> (you must already be logged in to your personal Google account. This will not work from the login screen), and run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>crossystem <span>dev_boot_usb</span><span>=</span>1 <span>dev_boot_legacy</span><span>=</span>1
<span>cd</span><span>;</span> curl <span>-LO</span> mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh
<span>sudo install</span> <span>-Dt</span> /usr/local/bin <span>-m</span> 755 firmware-util.sh
<span>sudo </span>firmware-util.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will open up the <code>firmware-util</code> settings screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://retrylife.ca/assets/images/fwutil_cros_wp-on.png" alt="firmware-util screen"></p>

<p>You will want to select the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> option to load the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> / SEABIOS payload. The <code>UEFI</code> option is technically the better choice, but it will completely remove the device’s ability to run ChromeOS again in the future.</p>

<h3 id="setting-fuses">Setting fuses</h3>

<p>The <code>RW_LEGACY</code> payload only works if the laptop always has power. Once the device completely runs out of power, the boot settings are wiped from the device (not something we want). The solution is to modify the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/vboot/+/master/_vboot_reference/firmware/include/gbb_header.h">system <code>gbb</code> fuses</a>. This sounds complicated (and it is), but Mr Chromebox comes to the rescue again with the <code>GBB Flags</code> option in his script. <em>After</em> the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> payload has been configured, run his script again, and select <code>GBB Flags</code>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-galliumos">Installing GalliumOS</h2>

<p>On another computer, <a href="https://galliumos.org/download">download GalliumOS</a> (make sure to select the <code>Braswell</code> option), and <a href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Creating_Bootable_USB">create a bootable USB</a>. Plug this USB into the Chromebook, reboot, and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> as the warning screen pops up. This will begin the GalliumOS setup process (which is identical to that of Ubuntu).</p>

<h3 id="enabling-verbose-boot">Enabling verbose boot</h3>

<p>It is nice to know what is happening when the device is booting. To disable the boot animation and replace it with the boot log, edit <code>/etc/default/grub</code>, and replace both the <code>quiet</code> and <code>splash</code> arguments with <code>noplymouth</code> in the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> options. Next, run the following, then reboot:</p>

<p>An interesting way for getting an intuitive sense for why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability" title="Poker hand probabilities">certain hands</a> are rare in poker, I've laid out all the cards in a standard deck in a grid:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/blank_1024x1024.png?v=1607133617" alt="Array of Playing Cards" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024">
</p>


<p>When I first learned to play poker, it took a while before I could get an intuitive understanding of the relationships between the various poker hands. Calculating their likelihood definitely helped get a handle on how many ways for a specific hand to actually occur there were.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I think laying the hands out in a grid like this would have given me an intuitive understanding of the game much more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Poker Hands shown geometrically</h2>
<p>So the lowest poker hand, high card, is the most common happening 50% of the time, but will rarely be the winning hand:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/High_Card_1024x1024.png?v=1607134813" alt="High Card" width="1023" height="1023"></p>

<p>The next highest hand is a single pair which has a geometric interpretation of one column with two dots in it:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134853" alt="Pair" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Two pair has a similar flair to it, except this one has 2 vertical lines:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Two_Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134962" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Three of a kind is similar in spirit, but is much rarer than the two preceding hands happening once every 50 hands:&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a straight, we need 5 cards that are in order without any gaps and can look kind of like a nice scatter plot:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_1024x1024.png?v=1607135179" alt="Straight" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A flush requires all 5 cards in the hand to be in a single horizontal row, but there can gaps between them:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/flush_84512f1f-428d-4ed7-b703-9372fc3575d6_1024x1024.png?v=1607135233" alt="Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A full house requires that all points be split into two lines of 3 and 2 points each:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/full_house_1024x1024.png?v=1607135454" alt="Full House" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Four of a Kind requires a vertical line that spans the entire grid with an extra point tucked away somewhere:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/4_of_a_kind_1024x1024.png?v=1607135655" alt="4 of a kind" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A straight flush is one of the tidiest hands as it requires all cards to be colinear on the same row and be immediately adjacent to each other:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_flush_1024x1024.png?v=1607135809" alt="Straight Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>The best hand that you can get is a subset of all the straight flushes that you can get. It's just a straight flush all the way against the right side of the grid with the 5 highest cards:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Royal_Flush_1024x1024.png?v=1607135877" alt="Royal Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>


<p>Looking at poker this way made me realize that there are some interesting hands that we could add to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rectangle</h2>
<p>This hand is formed when you have 4 points that are <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html" title="Mathematical Definition of colinearity">colinear</a> in both orthogonal axes (form a rectangle):&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Rectangle_1024x1024.png?v=1607136065" alt="Rectangle Hand" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<h2>Flower</h2>
<p>This one seems like it would be complicated to spot in the wild, but in reality it's a lot like a full house. You need a Three of a Kind and the other two cards need to be the same suit as one of your 3oK cards, and just before and after it. So, maybe it is a little complicated to spot, but it certainly is an interesting idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-04_at_18.42.56_1024x1024.png?v=1607136337" alt="Flower Hand" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<h2>Want More?</h2>

    <br>
    
    <br>
    
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/gRPC-1.html" target="_blank"><span>Part 1</span></a> of
        this series, we provided a high-level overview of <span>gRPC</span>, installed the necessary software, setup the
        environment, and finally demonstrated the <span>Unary</span> RPC communication in both Go and Java.</p>
      <p>In this part, we will continue the journey to the next RPC communication pattern - <span>Server Streaming</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Server Streaming RPC</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>Server Streaming</span> communication
        pattern:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/grpc-06.png" alt="Server Streaming Architecture"></p><p>Figure-6</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>In the Server Streaming RPC mode, the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with sequence (or stream)
        of messages back to the client.</p>
    <p>For the Server Streaming RPC demonstration, we will implement a fictitious Currency Rate service, where the client sends the
        'from' currency and the 'to' currency as the request and the server responds with a stream of 'rates' from different 'agents'.</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>We will first demonstrate the Currency Rate service using the Go programming language.</p>
      <p>In the <span>$GOPATH</span> directory, create the project directory hierarchy by executing the following
        commands:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p serverstream serverstream/currencypb serverstream/server serverstream/client</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>currency.proto</span> located in the directory <span>
        $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb</span> as shown below:</p>
    <fieldset id="sc-fieldset">
      <legend>currency.proto</legend>
      <pre>/*

syntax = "proto3";

package serverstream;

option go_package = "polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb";

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "com.polarsparc.gss";

message CurrencyRateRequest {
  string from = 1;
  string to = 2;
}

message CurrencyRateResponse {
  string agent = 1;
  string from = 2;
  string to = 3;
  double rate = 4;
}

service CurrencyService {
  rpc getCurrencyRate(CurrencyRateRequest) returns (stream CurrencyRateResponse) {};
}</pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The request message is defined as <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span> and the response message is defined as
        <span>CurrencyRateResponse</span>. The service interface is defined as <span>CurrencyService</span>
        with an RPC method <span>getCurrencyRate</span> that takes in a <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span>
        as an input and returns a sequence (or <span>stream</span>) of <span>CurrencyRateResponse</span>
        objects.</p>
    <p>To compile the <span>currency.proto</span> file, execute the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream</p>
      <p>$ protoc currencypb/currency.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:$GOPATH/src</p>
    </div>
    <p>On success, this will generate the Go code file called <span>currency.pb.go</span> located in the directory
        <span>$GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb</span>.</p>
    <p>From the file <span>currency.pb.go</span>, we see the <span>CurrencyServiceServer</span> interface,
        as shown below, that the server needs to implements:</p>
    <fieldset id="sc-fieldset">
      <legend>currency.pb.go</legend>
      <pre>.
.
.
type CurrencyServiceServer interface {
	GetCurrencyRate(*CurrencyRateRequest, CurrencyService_GetCurrencyRateServer) error
}
.
.
.</pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>currency_provider.go</span> that simulates an in-memory
        store for initializing and returning currency rates from fictitious agents and is located in the directory <span>
        $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/server</span> as shown below:</p>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong><strong>Esperanto Accelerates Machine Learning With 1000+ Low-Power RISC-V Cores on a Single Chip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Esperanto Technologies has developed a ground-breaking accelerator chip for large-scale machine learning applications employing over 1000 RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>In this talk, Esperanto provides an overview of the company’s new ET-SoC-1 chip, which features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores. The ET-Maxion, previewed at the RISC-V Summit in 2018, is a superscalar out-of-order core delivering high performance for modern operating systems and applications. The complementary ET-Minion core designed by Esperanto is a leaner, energy efficient, in-order multithreaded core with a vector/tensor accelerator unit at the heart of the massively parallel compute array.</li>
<li>The chip’s performance and efficiency is derived from a combination of factors, including the simplicity of the RISC-V instruction set, wide vector/tensor units on every ET-Minion core, a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom pipeline architecture and low-voltage circuits which enables more energy-efficient operation. The result is that Esperanto will deliver better performance per watt than legacy CPU and GPU solutions, as well as competing fixed-function designs without compromising generally purpose flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Esperanto Technologies</strong></p>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Although Dan, if you read this, the <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1133341485133438982">“animation pass” mode</a> you’ve mentioned offhandedly sounds very relevant! <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

Games generally have a short-lived sales cycle so I am not expecting a huge increase in sales after this.</p>
<p>I’m writing this up to help other indie developers calibrate their expectations. You often read about the success stories because people love to read that it’s possible to make it big with a hit game, but few people bother to write up mediocre outcomes, which is the outcome of <em>most</em> game development efforts. This is called “selection bias”.</p>
<p>You can find a list of all the marketing and promotion I did below, to give you an idea of what kind of an effect you can expect from a single person doing all coding and all promotion by themselves.</p>

<p>Let’s cut to the chase.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>30</code> copies of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cx.mccormick.asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">Asterogue for Android</a> were sold netting <code>$89 USD</code>.</li>
<li><code>18</code> copies of <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue">Asterogue for Windows</a> were sold netting <code>$132 USD</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Total sales = <code>$221 USD</code></p>
<p>The game got a couple of five star ratings on each platform. Interestingly, the average payment for the Windows version was around $6 which is double the suggested $3 (people were able to choose any amount higher than $3).</p>
<p>The main cost making the game was my own time. If I had been charging one of my freelance clients to make this game it would have cost around <code>$5k - $10k</code> over 1.5 months of part time development at my normal hourly rate. Incidentally if you’re interested in having a game like this made, <a href="mailto:chris@mccormick.cx" rel="nofollow noopener">hit me up</a>. :)</p>

<p>It’s interesting to look at the visits to the game’s pages on each platform, and the click-through-rate of people who visited the page and then went on the buy the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Windows page on Itch saw <code>1,937</code> views with a click-through purchase rate of just under 1%.</li>
<li>The Google Play store doesn’t give raw numbers but it says the conversion rate is about 1% too.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s an implication here that if I could drive more traffic to these pages I could expect 1 out of every 100 visitors to buy the game.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of all the marketing and promotion I did while building the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx/status/1306223700199448577" rel="nofollow noopener">Kept a Twitter thread up to date with the latest changes</a> (about 1250 followers).</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=70875.0" rel="nofollow noopener">Posted devlogs to the TIGSource forum</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/search/?q=saturday%20sharing&amp;source=recent&amp;restrict_sr=1" rel="nofollow noopener">Participated in Saturday Sharing on /r/roguelikedev</a>.</li>
<li>I sent a couple of updates to my own email newsletter subscribers (there are 90 subscribers).</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://dev.to/chr15m" rel="nofollow noopener">dev.to posts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of everywhere I launched the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/jkt4ue/asterogue_released_today_sci_fi_pixel_graphics/" rel="nofollow noopener">Launched on /r/roguelikes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/it-s-asterogue-launch-day" rel="nofollow noopener">On my own blog</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed the <a href="https://infinitelives.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">infinitelives mailing list</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed my own email newsletter subscribers.</li>
<li>Created a listing on <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">RogueBasin</a> and in the news section too.</li>
<li>Kenney.nl discord in #promotion</li>
<li>Roguelikes discord in #advertise-releases</li>
<li>On the local game dev discord in my city.</li>
<li>On the local web dev front-enders Slack chat in my city (the game is built with front-end web technology).</li>
</ul>
<p>After release I also wrote some blog posts here on the game’s Itch devlog and linked a couple of these to Hacker News. The post <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue/devlog/190653/my-game-wont-sell-and-thats-ok">My game won’t sell and that’s ok</a> got 7k hits.</p>

<p>There are three main strategies I can think of to improve sales for this game and future games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaizen. Improving the game. Fixing issues people have flagged and making quality of life improvements from player feedback.</li>
<li>Keep making more games. Compound on the interest and marketing garnered by this game. This is the strategy of <a rel="nofollow noopener">Sokpop games</a> and when I did an analysis of their collective I realized they probably didn’t make a profit until game number 8.</li>
<li>Use a 3rd party company for promotion instead of doing it myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am going to allocate time in my schedule to improve Asterogue. I got some great feedback and I want to polish those rough edges and fix all the issues people have flagged.</p>
<p>I will almost certainly make more graphically rich roguelike games in the future, because it was so much fun to do so. Thank you very much to everybody who bought the game, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I think the key is to do this without great expectations, just try to make the best games possible, and have fun doing it.</p>
<p>If you want to hear about games and other stuff I make you can follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx" rel="nofollow noopener">on Twitter @mccrmx</a> or <a href="https://mccormick.cx/" rel="nofollow noopener">subscribe to my newsletter at mccormick.cx</a>. Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the fall of 2007, my parents gave me an unforgettable gift for my sixteenth birthday: a first-generation iPhone.</p><p>I still clearly remember watching the keynote in which Steve Jobs announced the first Apple-branded phone a few months earlier. As a teenager attending high school in my hometown of Vicenza, Italy, I tuned into the livestream just before dinner, carefully listening to every word he said. That evening, Jobs started announcing a “widescreen iPod with touch controls”, a “revolutionary mobile phone” and a “breakthrough Internet communications device”–theatrically pausing before confessing that he was actually talking about one single device: the iPhone. Thousands of miles away from me, you could hear attendees exploding cheerfully through the live feed. Jobs went on demoing this amazing invention that, a decade later, would end up changing much more than the mobile phones market: it directly or indirectly impacted our society through mobile web, app stores, changing work-life balance, and social media.</p><p>October came, and so did the day I finally got my iPhone. I was really excited as I was the first one in my social circle with one. Every other teenager (and adult!) that saw my phone reacted in awe and with lots of curiosity. More than a few were also secretly envious, something I secretly did not mind. To add to the novelty, at the time the iPhone was only available for sale in the US.</p><p>To get an iPhone for me, my father had to ask a friend traveling to New York on a business trip to bring one back on the plane with her. That was not the end of it, however, as all phones were locked to the AT&amp;T network. In order for me to be able to use my iPhone in Italy, I had to unlock it.</p><p>That process required learning a variety of tools and techniques developed by hackers in the community, then documented in various blogs and forums. The first step was to <em>jailbreak</em> the phone, which gave you full access to the system and allowed you to run third-party apps. Then you’d have add one of those “hacking” apps to your phone, which patched the bootloader to remove the lock the US carrier had put on it. Despite sounding like a mouthful, the iPhone hacking community had worked hard on the User Experience (UX), making this entire process relatively easy for most people with basic tech skills.</p><hr><p>I really loved my shiny, new iPhone, and I was so excited about it that I was willing to accept many of its original limitations. It only supported slow 2G networks, didn’t have copy/paste, couldn’t transfer files via Bluetooth to my friends, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">famously</a> didn’t support Adobe Flash, which was ubiquitous on the web at the time.</p><p>However, there was one thing I really couldn’t stand: the Messages application could only store 1,000 texts (SMS).</p><p>That was 2007 — before the days of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc. Instant messaging was something people did on their PCs only, with things like Windows Live Messenger (née MSN Messenger) or AIM.</p><p>For a high schooler like me, text messaging was the main way I kept in touch with my friends daily (<em>what was I supposed to do, call them?</em>). With my carrier giving me a whopping 100 free texts per day (seriously, we had to pay for them), between sent and received texts it would take less than a week to reach the storage limit of 1,000.</p><p>That’s when it all started.</p><p>Because my iPhone was already “hacked” (jailbroken), as a requirement for unlocking it and use it in Italy, I had full system access already. That allowed me to c extract any document I wanted, including my phone’s text message database.</p><p>It wasn’t even a month since I got my iPhone that I had already built a small “app” running on my laptop to archive my text messages forever. I would manually extract the SMS database from my iPhone, copy it to my laptop, then use a set of scripts written in PHP (the only programming language I knew at the time) to store the messages in a local database, and finally display them using a web-based interface.</p><p>This thing I put together worked just fine for me, but I immediately realized the “business potential” of what I had just created. Just like myself, I assumed many others had the same annoyance. I could have used what I learned to help them too, and maybe make some pocket change in the process. As a matter of fact, I did consider myself an enterprising teenager.</p><p>The idea had potential, and the “app” I built for myself already provided solid foundations, so I just needed to do a bit more work to turn it into a commercially-viable project.</p><p>The biggest challenge was making the solution more accessible to others, including those who were not particularly tech-savvy. That’s when I started learning about app development for iPhone.</p><p>Famously, Apple did not want the iPhone to support third-party apps at the beginning, saying developers should build web apps instead. That policy didn’t last long, and with the iPhone OS 2 update, launched in mid-2008, the official App Store came to life: the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>However, the hacking community had already found a way to sideload apps and had even developed an “app store” called Cydia where you could find games, apps, and even mods to enhance the capabilities of the operating system itself. Cydia came preinstalled on every <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone, which meant potentially hundreds of thousands of people had access to it.</p><p>Everyone could build apps that would be published on Cydia, as long as you knew how to–something that was not remotely as easy to do as it is with today’s tools. As an enterprising teenager with quite a bit of free time on my hand during those winter afternoons and evenings, I took on that challenge.</p><hr><p>The first version of YouArchive.It came out in January 2008.</p><p>Today, you would describe YouArchive.It as a cloud service to store iPhone text messages. You could store all your messages in there, then read and search them using a web-based application.</p><p>There’s still a video left on YouTube showing the application in action (this was the third, and last, version):</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ps5ohEhO3S4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>With YouArchive.It came an iPhone application too. Published on the Cydia app store, it allowed importing messages into the “cloud service” directly from the phone.</p><p>YouArchive.It was free to use with a limit of 80,000 text messages. Because personal communications can be sensitive, all messages were stored encrypted. With a one-time payment of just €5 (about $6), you could become a VIP, remove any limit and enjoy unlimited storage.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vTxYRljXFl3IBXGRsXOVag.png" alt="A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone"></p><figcaption>A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone</figcaption><p>For the next year and a half, YouArchive.It continued to grow organically. A few blogs and websites dedicated to iPhone “hacking” and to the underground app stores wrote about the app. Even a small radio program in the US featured it</p><p>I continued developing the app as a side project while in high school. I was also providing tech support and maintaining the infrastructure.</p><p>Listening to users' feedback, I would periodically add new features. YouArchive.It started displaying emojis as soon as the iPhone supported that (outside of Japan, it required downloading an app to enable them). Users asked for and got the ability to restore texts in another iPhone, before iCloud was available. I also implemented other privacy features such as requiring a password to open the mobile app.</p><blockquote><h3 id="what-i-didnt-realize-at-the-time-however-is-that-i-had-unknowingly-and-unwillingly-built-a-spying-tool-and-a-really-convenient-and-efficient-one">What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</h3></blockquote><p>Enough users were paying the fee to become VIP that I could cover the costs of running the service–this was before everyone was using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, so I was renting a co-located physical server which wasn’t cheap–and keep some pocket cash. Not much, but enough to pay for some hobbies and outings with friends.</p><p>Most importantly, building YouArchive.It gave me a lot of satisfaction and the opportunity to learn a lot of things about software development, business, dealing with customers and listening to their feedback.</p><hr><p>When I finally shut the service down, in June 2010, YouArchive.It had about 32,000 registered users who stored over 76 million messages.</p><p>The first, and stated, reason for the deprecation was a technical one: YouArchive.It’s iPhone app required using private APIs, which meant it could not be published on the App Store (and it still couldn’t to this day), limiting it to <em>jailbroken</em> phones only.</p><p>The second reason however was the most important to me, even though I have not revealed it until now.</p><p>About a year before the app closed, in April 2009 I implemented a new feature that was requested by many users: the ability to upload texts automatically, in background, without user intervention. For paying “VIP” users only, the mobile app could automatically send all new text messages to YouArchive.It, as often as every 15 minutes.</p><p>Automatic upload was an incredible convenience for many users that wanted to hoard their texts like me, to keep them forever, search within them, print or export them, or just liked having a backup.</p><p>What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</p><p>Thanks to background uploads, people could install the YouArchive.It app on another person’s iPhone, set it up, maybe even hide it (something possible on a <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone), and then watch as the text messages come in, almost real-time. Jealous partners, stalkers and the likes could install this tool on an unknowing victim’s phone with relative ease.</p><p>I can’t remember how I discovered that — it might have been a support request from a user or a post in a bulletin board. I also can’t know how many people were using YouArchive.It for their own archiving rather than to spy on others. Realizing what my users were doing, however, made me feel really uncomfortable and I did not want any part of that anymore.</p><p>As a senior in high school, barely eighteen years-old, I realized for the first time how technology can have a …</p></article></div>
