<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>While trying to implement a long planned feature, an ad block in Angelfish, the Plasma Mobile webbrowser,
I was looking for a mostly complete and performant library that provides this functionality.</p>

<p>First I found libadblockplus, which is a C++ library providing the AdblockPlus core functionality.
Sounds great, right? Well, not quite. It includes it’s own v8 java script engine,
and since we are talking about a webbrowser with a QML interface here,
including a third java script engine and a second copy of v8 was absolutely not an option.
Even if this wasn’t a webbrowser,
running a java script engine as implementation detail of a library is at least … problematic.</p>

<p>The other option I found is <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">adblock-rust</a>,
which is the built-in ad block of the Brave browser. As the name tells, it is written in Rust,
and I was originally looking for a C++ library. But it turned out this was not much of a problem,
since Rust features excellent C interoperability, just like C++.
Based on this common ground, bindings can be created to use Rust code from C++ (and the other way around if needed).</p>

<h2 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h2>
<p>My first approach was to use raw ffi. That means essentially building a C API featuring the typical C primitive types in rust,
and telling the rust compiler to represent structs in memory the same way that C would do.
Thanks to cbindgen, which automatically generates a header file with the information for the C compiler to know which fields a struct has and were they are,
we directly get something we can include in our C++ project.</p>

<p>The rust build system cargo is capable of running custom code at build time, and we can use that to run cbindgen on our rust code, by adding a file named <code>build.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cbindgen;

use std::env;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    cbindgen::generate(&amp;crate_dir)
        .unwrap()
        .write_to_file("bindings.h");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our core data structure for the ad block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Adblock {
    blocker: *mut Engine,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It stores a pointer to the rust Engine type in a C compatible struct.
The struct can not be created directly from C / C++, since we don’t know anything about the Engine type there.</p>

<p>So we need a function on the rust side that creates and initializes the Engine for us and packs it into an <code>Adblock</code> struct.
Since the code in angelfish is doing a bit more than only that, the function takes two C string arguments, and returns a pointer to a mutable (non-const) Adblock object.</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn new_adblock(
    list_dir: *const c_char,
    public_domain_suffix_file: *const c_char,
) -&gt; *mut Adblock
</code></pre>
<p>A few more thigs in this function signature are unusual, but they are all related to the FFI / C compatibility we need here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>#[no_mangle]</code> tells the rust compiler not to apply its rust specific function name mangling</li>
  <li><code>extern "C"</code> tells that this function should use the C calling conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every time we interact with data from C, the rust compiler is unable to run its usual safety checks.
For that reason we need unsafe blocks around those lines of code.
If anything unexpectedly segfaults, it’s likely to be in our unsafe blocks.
To get a string that we can feed into a usual rust API, we can use <code>unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(public_domain_suffix_file).to_str() }</code>.</p>

<p>For more examples of how to interact with the C / C++ side, feel free to have a look at <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/20e166c0fe2e38be63824b957c02fa58865ac67c/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">some real code in Angelfish</a>.
I’m by no means an expert on this, but it should help you get started.</p>

<p>Using this approach, the ad block could successfully be implemented in about 140 lines of rust code, of which only half is FFI code, and the rest actual logic.</p>

<h2 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h2>
<p>The second approach is to use the cxx crate (library), which can generate most of the boilerplate FFI code automatically, and provides a modern API on the C++ side.
To do that, it implements its own wrapper types, each wrapping the functionality of one type of one of the languages. Those wrapper types are implemented in both languages, and allow easily passing more advanced types than pointers and number types through the FFI boundary.
On the rust side, the wrapper types are not really visible, because a macro generates everything for us.</p>

<p>The only unusual thing on the rust side will be a small ffi module, declaring which types and functions we want to expose to C++:</p>
<pre><code>#[cxx::bridge]
mod ffi {
    extern "Rust" {
        type Adblock;
        type AdblockResult;

        fn new_adblock(list_dir: &amp;str, suffix_file: &amp;str) -&gt; Box&lt;Adblock&gt;;
        fn should_block(
            self: &amp;Adblock,
            url: &amp;str,
            source_url: &amp;str,
            request_type: &amp;str,
        ) -&gt; Box&lt;AdblockResult&gt;;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All objects are returned as smart pointers, like <code>Box</code>.
On the C++ side, this will result in a <code>rust::Box&lt;Adblock&gt;</code>, which is a type generated by the cxx_build crate, which is doing something slightly similar to cbindgen.</p>

<p>With the cxx crate, our build.rs will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cxx_build;

fn main() {
    cxx_build::bridge("src/adblock.rs").compile("angelfish-adblock")
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may wonder, if the cxx crate makes everything so easy, why did I start with approach 1 at all?
I had had a look at the cxx crate a few month ago, when it was still too minimal to do what I needed. Luckily I had another look, since it has become really useful in the meantime.
However learning the raw ffi way was important to understand what actually happens in the background, and I’d almost recommend everyone to have a look at that first before using the cxx crate. Using <code>cargo expand</code> you can then understand what cxx generated for you.</p>

<p>Given the cxx crate makes this so much easier, I initially feared it might add tons of new dependencies and increase the build time, but to my surprise it actually has a lot less dependencies than cbindgen. Even though cbindgen only uses those at build time (they don’t end up in the binary), they take some time to build.</p>

<p>Angelfish has recently switched to using the cxx crate, so you find usage examples in the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/d92e48e392303deda6cf3c1552f9f7b5189e2953/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">current version of the ad block code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="build-system">Build system</h2>
<p>After we have written the FFI, we need to build the Rust code as part of our project, most likely using CMake. This could be very annoying and complicated, but luckily <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/corrosion">Corrosion</a> exists to make this very easy for us.
It can build our rust code using the cargo build system, and create CMake targets for the library we built, so its easy to link against it.</p>

<h2 id="usage-in-kde">Usage in KDE</h2>
<p>Now that the implementation part is explained,
it makes sense to look into where this can be useful and where not.
Unfortunately the truth is that some distros are still not fully happy with having to package rust code,
because the rust community has a different approach to sharing code than known from the C / C++ world.
While Qt re-implements some functionality also found in other C++ libraries, to only make it necessary to package Qt and not one library for json, one for xml, for http and so on, the rust community likes to split everything into small packages, so no unnecessary code is included.</p>

<p>In Angelfish, all the rust code is optional, and Angelfish can of course still be built without Rust.</p>

<p>Possible areas in KDE that could profit from using Rust are icon and SVG theme rendering code, which could profit from using rsvg or resvg.
I can imagine it could also be useful for document thumbnailers, when a rust implementation of the file type already exists. A similar case could be KIO workers, and pretty much any other project that can profit from optional plugins.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach to using Rust in KDE allows to make use of the many libraries and language features the ecosystem provides, without running into the infamous “rewrite it in Rust” reflex. It avoids having to create rust bindings for all KDE Frameworks and Qt only to make use of Rust, and still produces readable code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	   

<p>I accidentally stumbled upon something yesterday that I felt like
sharing, which fell squarely into the "why the hell didn’t I know about this
before?" category. In this post, I’ll describe how to manage
the various configuration files in your GNU/Linux home directory (aka
"dotfiles" like <code>.bashrc</code>) using GNU Stow.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that it would be helpful to manage one’s
configuration files with a version control system like Git, Mercurial
or Bazaar, but many/most dotfiles reside at the top-level of your home
directory, where it wouldn’t be a good idea to initialize a VCS
repository. Over time I’ve come across various programs which aim to
manage this for you by keeping all the files in a subdirectory and
then installing or linking them into their appropriate places. None of
those programs ever really appealed to me.  They would require a ton
of dependencies (like Ruby and a ton of libraries for it) or they
would require me to remember how to use them, which is difficult when
really for such a task you rarely use the program.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow">GNU Stow</a> to manage
programs I install from source to <code>/usr/local/</code>. Basically, in this typical
usage, you install locally built packages to
<code>/usr/local/stow/${PKGNAME}-{PKGVERSION}</code> and then from <code>/usr/local/stow/</code> you run
<code># stow ${PKGNAME}-${PKGVERSION}</code> and the program generates symbolic links to
all the programs' files into the appropriate places under <code>/usr/local/</code>. Then,
when you uninstall a program via Stow, you don’t have to worry about any stray
files that you or a provide Makefile may have missed. It also makes handling
alternate versions of a program quite easy (i.e. when I’m experimenting with
different configurations of <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> or
<a href="http://st.suckless.org/">st</a>).</p>

<p>Some time ago I happened across a mailing list posting where someone described
using Stow to manage the installation of their dotfiles. I didn’t pay much
attention to it but my brain must have filed it away for later. Yesterday I
decided to give it a try and I have to say that it is so much more convenient
than those other dedicated dotfile-management programs, even if it wasn’t an
immediately obvious option.</p>

<p>The procedure is simple. I created the <code>${HOME}/dotfiles</code> directory and then
inside it I made subdirectories for all the programs whose cofigurations I
wanted to manage. Inside each of those directories, I moved in all the
appropriate files, maintaining the directory structure of my home directory. So,
if a file normally resides at the top level of your home directory, it would go
into the top level of the program’s subdirectory. If a file normally goes in the
default <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/${PKGNAME}</code> location (<code>${HOME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code>),
then it would instead go in <code>${HOME}/dotfiles/${PKGNAME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code> and
so on. Finally, from the <code>dotfiles</code> directory, you just run <code>$ stow $PKGNAME</code>
and Stow will symlink all the package’s configuration files to the appropriate
locations. It’s then easy to make the <code>dotfiles</code> a VCS repository so you can
keep track of changes you make (plus it makes it so much easier to share
configurations between different computers, which was my main reason to do it).</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you want to manage the configuration for Bash, VIM and
Uzbl. Bash has a couple files in the top-level directory; VIM typically has your
.vimrc file on the top-level and a .vim directory; and Uzbl has files in
<code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/uzbl</code> and <code>${XDG_DATA_HOME}/uzbl</code>. So, your home directory
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    brandon/
        .config/
            uzbl/
                [...some files]
        .local/
            share/
                uzbl/
                    [...some files]
        .vim/
            [...some files]
        .bashrc
        .bash_profile
        .bash_logout
        .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>You would then create a <code>dotfiles</code> subdirectory and move all the files there:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    /brandon/
        .config/
        .local/
            .share/
        dotfiles/
            bash/
                .bashrc
                .bash_profile
                .bash_logout
            uzbl/
                .config/
                    uzbl/
                        [...some files]
                .local/
                    share/
                        uzbl/
                            [...some files]
            vim/
                .vim/
                    [...some files]
                .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>Then, perform the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ stow bash
$ stow uzbl
$ stow vim
</code></pre>

<p>And, voila, all your config files (well, symbolic links to them) are
all in the correct place, however disorganized that might be, while
the actual files are all neatly organized in your <code>dotfiles</code>
directory, which is easily turned into a VCS repo. One handy thing is
that if you use multiple computers, which may not have the same
software installed on them, you can pick and choose which
configurations to install when you need them. All of your dotfiles are
always available in your <code>dotfiles</code> directory, but if you don’t need
the configuration for one program, you simply don’t Stow it and thus
it does not clutter your home directory.</p>

<p>Well, that’s all there is to it. Hopefully someone else out there
finds this useful! I know I’ve found it to be a huge help.</p>

<p>Not Being Bullish Enough on Bitcoin is a big mistake. Why? You’ll sell too early, and not grasp Bitcoin well enough to get the big picture here. You might not secure the coins well enough, and you might not actually realise the societal implications of Bitcoin. </p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Selling too early</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, a lot of people did not truly peer into <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/185">what Bitcoin is</a>, and this made them not bullish enough. This is a big error, as it pushes them to sell bitcoin too early. While they think they’re being clever timing a top, Bitcoin proceeds to humble them a few years later after another cycle. </p>



<p>Lopp has a great example here: </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At time of writing in Dec 2020, Bitcoin is now around $23,000 USD. Selling early is penny wise, pound foolish. </p>



<p>Many people wish they had bought bitcoin earlier, but truth be told: that’s only half the challenge. The other half is actually HODLing it through the long term and not selling it out. </p>



<p>As bitcoin old-timers in the space will tell you, you could have bought early… but then you probably would have also sold early. It takes understanding and conviction.</p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Not Securing it Correctly</h2>



<p>It’s a wild roller-coaster. Bitcoin can 10x in the space of a few months, and you can be left <em>very</em> exposed if you’re not careful. A $10k bitcoin stack can quickly become $100k, a $100k stack can quickly become $1M and so on. </p>



<p>Consider the worth of your stack currently, and think about if Bitcoin were to 10x or 20x over a few months or a year. Would you be comfortable with the level of security you have? </p>



<p>If you aren’t bullish enough, and you’re only looking for a 2x and then flip for fiat profits, you aren’t thinking big enough. You should be looking to learn about bitcoin security by listening to SLP such as <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/97">SLP97</a> and <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/215">SLP215</a> with Michael Flaxman. You should be looking at ways to: </p>



<ul><li>Ensure appropriate entropy in your bitcoin seed generation </li><li>Minimise single points of failure</li><li>Consider multi signature</li><li>In the ideal case, use open source hardware and software that has been vetted from a security perspective</li><li>Learn about how to verify signatures for software you use</li><li>Learn hardware wallet best practices</li></ul>



<h2>Not learning enough about how to use Bitcoin the right way</h2>



<p>When we talk about using Bitcoin, we mean using it in a self sovereign way. You shouldn’t be in a situation where you are exclusively trusting or relying on your service provider to give you your bitcoins. </p>



<p>This is not stocks or dollars in your bank account. This is Bitcoin. Use it the self sovereign way. </p>



<p>In practice this means: </p>



<ul><li>Don’t leave your coins in custodial accounts. Use sovereign bitcoin wallets where you hold the private keys. Or at least, a quorum of private keys (e.g. you hold 2 of 3 keys, or 4 of 5 keys). </li><li>Ideally, perform your own validation by running your own underlying bitcoin node. This is easy with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/09/28/cost-effective-bitcoin-use-hardware-wallet-own-node/">Specter Desktop + Bitcoin Core</a>, or with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/03/26/mynode-video-tutorials/">myNode</a>, or other projects e.g. Umbrel, <a href="http://raspiblitz.com/">RaspiBlitz</a>, <a href="http://ronindojo.io/">Ronin Dojo</a>, <a href="http://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay Server</a>, <a href="http://nodl.it/">nodl</a> etc. </li></ul>



<h2>Not realising the societal implications of Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Fiat money has cultural consequences that many simply do not understand right now. It’s like we’re fish swimming in the water without realising what we’re swimming in. We’ve grown up in an environment of cheap debt, facing incentives to go into debt or lose. </p>



<p>This drives all kinds of changes in our society that weren’t so obvious pre-1971. Increased welfare statism, increased debt, higher time preference, increased centralisation into managerial superstates, to name a few. </p>



<p>As Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, society’s return to hard money will drive significant cultural shifts that align with the return to hard money. Listen to <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/51">SLP51 with Guido Hulsmann</a> to know more.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, it takes knowledge, conviction, and dedication to do this. There are many pitfalls along the way, and it takes work from the HODLer to methodically and skilfully avoid these pitfalls. Of course, we can lament the difficulty and push it off til the future when it’ll be easier. But that is also giving up the huge return potential, and also the freedom and moral imperative of bringing about a Bitcoin Standard. </p>



<p>Do your research and learning, be methodical in your approach, and you’ll be in with a good shot. </p>

</p><h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>ASCII is an acronym of "American Standard Code for Information
Interchange". ASCII art means art made out of different characters in
the ASCII map and can thus be represented in plain text format. It
cannot include extended characters or text formatting such as bold or
italics. ASCII art is always done on a fixed-width font like Courier
New or Fixedsys, never on a proportional font like Arial or Times New
Roman. It can be made in Notepad or MS-DOS Edit, but there are also
some specific programs for making ASCII art. And no, I'm not talking
about ASCII converters.</p><p>
People often comment on ASCII art by saying "Wow, that is so amazing,
I'd never have the patience to make something like that". I don't get
it. Why do they think ASCII art requires so much patience? I can make a
decent fullscreen ASCII in an hour (even if it sometimes takes ten
hours). It takes me at least fifteen hours to draw a decent fullscreen
CG picture.</p><p>
ASCII art isn't easy and it does require skill, but you don't have to
care about things like brush strokes or colors and usually not about
shading either. In a way it is a lot like pixel art. When I started
pixeling it felt very familiar due to my ASCII and ANSI experience.
Pixel artists will probably experience a similar reaction when they
start drawing ASCII. You don't have to have great drawing skills to be
a good ASCII artist. I, for instance, suck at drawing, I can paint but
I can't do the sketch like thing at all. ASCII sketching is practically
something non-existant, but if this interests you, nothing stops you
from trying this new style.</p><p>
Some people wonder what's the point. What's the point in making art in
general? I think limitations are what makes art interesting and feeds
the creative mind. ASCII art probably isn't something that you
encounter in an art museum (which is regrettable), it's more like
everyday art. I guess it has something in common with pop art. ASCII
art can be sent via email or to Usenet newsgroups, it can be
used on IRC and many chatrooms (do that with caution, though). You can
include ASCII art in your signature or login screen or print it out
with your old matrix printer. It can be used for representing game
situations, graphs or molecular models.</p><p>
I've heard opinions of ASCII art not being art but graphical design,
but I disagree with that. Design is usually considered to be something
functional, such as advertisements or interfaces, while visual art is
something you can hang on your walls. ASCII art usually isn't
functional but aesthetical. I know people who have ASCII pictures
hanging on their walls.</p><p>

There are other ASCII tutorials, but I decided there's still room
for another one. Many of the others are outdated, some are even more
than 10 years old. They also feature slightly different techniques and
lack some of the parts that my tutorial focuses on. This turned out
perhaps more like a ASCII drawing/culture FAQ than an actual tutorial,
but I hope it will still be useful.

</p><h2>2 Types of ASCII art</h2>

<h4>2.1 Lineart</h4>

<div><p>Lineart is just what its name implies, things are represented with
(usually thin) outlines, sometimes dotty, sometimes consisting mostly
of slashes, underscores and pipes. Lineart also includes most FIGlet
fonts and demoscene logos. Suitable for both huge images and tiny
pictures.</p></div><pre>            .-"""-.

<h4>2.2 Solid</h4>

<div><p>Solid art is the "opposite" of lineart, it's not outlined but filled
and flat-shaded.
It's often best fit on mid-sized and large pictures, though it can also
work for small pieces, such as the heart here. Often it looks better
than lineart, simply for the fact that it's not as "thin". Solid art is
often used for logos, ornament designs and text, but it fits almost any
kind of subject. It's not very well suited for faces though.</p></div><pre>  ,o8o, ,o8o,

<h4>2.3 Grayscale</h4>

<div><p>Grayscale is like solid art, but it consists of many different
characters that are used to portrays lighter and darker areas, making
it the most suitable kind of ASCII for picturing faces. It is usually
best viewed white on black, such as the example below (people using
most graphical browsers can select it with a mouse or press Ctrl-A to
see it in inverse color). Most converters create grayscale art, though
rather messy kind with often no antialiasing. Grayscale could be
considered the most difficult of all ASCII techniques.</p></div><pre>                           .,,,yyyy@@yyyyy,,,

<h4>2.4 Camelized</h4>

<p>Camelized ASCII art isn't very popular, even though it already appeared
in
the book Alice in Wonderland. It is usually poetry (sometimes prose)
made into the shape of an object, often an animal. There are a couple
of different techniques for making the shapes. Some people use extra
spacing to achieve lines of required length, others wrap words from the
middle or use extra characters. JavE has a feature for camelized ASCII.

            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.7.2--><p>Calvin Barrows has written an article for railbusinessdaily.com about the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Calvin is a Chartered Engineer, latterly retired. His work focused on forensic engineering, to establish the mechanisms of structural and mechanical failures; then continuing as an engineering manager, within the rail industry.</p>
<p>Sylvia Telatycka is co-author and linguist, who with Calvin runs a small but successful property development and rental business.</p>
<p>“This guest article aims to encourage a wider discussion around our hypothesis as to the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Rather than go into complicated thermodynamic formulae to demonstrate the credible science upon which this theory is based, we have described in simple terms the comparable heat generation and heat exchange processes at work, to clarify how these affect this historic Tube network. This is important because, in the earliest days of the London Tube, overheating was simply not an issue…. but WHY….?</p>
<p>In the first instance, we need to understand clearly what the problem is. Paraphrasing Charles Kettering: a problem well defined is half solved and mindful of that, we took the basic premise of the Tube overheating and framed a series of questions to help identify the problem.</p>
<p>1. When does overheating happen?</p>
<p>2. Do ALL metros/subways overheat?</p>
<p>3. Why might some metros/subways overheat, and some might not?</p>
<p>4. And why are these questions relevant to London’s network?</p>
<p>5. How can this overheating be mitigated?</p>
<p>Few would disagree that the Tube overheats but understanding WHEN and WHERE it happens is most revealing. In winter passengers mainly travel bundled up in their winter coats and the saloons are heated. In summer, heavy clothing is shed – indeed some passengers have been known to travel in swimwear.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png" alt="" width="598" height="320" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png 598w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"></p>
<p>In the above graph i, London’s mean surface ambient air temperatures, averaged over a 30 year period, show a clear increase from approximately -5°C in the winter to around +30°C in the summer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the following graph ii represents the results of TfL’s temperature monitoring within the underground network, for both the deep tube and sub-surface lines. The TfL temperature variations not only confirm passengers’ subjective perception, they also mimic the curve of temperature data above and demonstrate conclusively that underground network temperatures align with the external seasonal temperatures.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png" alt="" width="587" height="298" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png 587w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px"></p>
<p>In the course of our research we looked at different types of rail networks, categorising them as follows because they all perform differently in relation to overheating:-</p>
<p>1. Metro train networks – which run ONLY underground.</p>
<p>2. Trains networks – which run predominately overground.</p>
<p>3. Metro train networks – which run both overground and underground.</p>
<p>Underground-only networks like Glasgow’s or Warsaw’s are not affected by the overground conditions, so there is little seasonal variation in train and network temperatures. Their ambient underground temperature remains about 16°C – unlike the wide temperature range the TfL data above show for London’s Tube network. Underground-only networks irrefutably demonstrate that operational heat such as braking, being generated year-round, is NOT a significant cause of metro networks overheating. Furthermore, since passengers are not being exposed to overheating they remain comfortable and safe.</p>
<p>Overground-only trains are cool in winter and therefore heated. However, in summer they will overheat, unless they are proactively cooled, usually by air-conditioning, though AC deals with the symptoms, not underlying causes, and it is environmentally unfriendly. Whilst AC is technically sound as long as it can discharge the exhaust heat to free air, if it does not work for some reason…. What then? There have been at least three incidents over the last 15 years where power failures compromised the AC, triggering saloon temperature rises to 46°C; with distressed passengers fainting from heat exhaustion, and others desperate enough to smash windows and even to try and break through emergency doors.</p>
<p>Which brings us neatly to MIXED metro networks like London’s Tube, which run both overground and underground, to see why this overheating is NOT restricted to the overground areas of these networks. The reason behind this apparent contradiction is that these mixed networks are, thermodynamically speaking, open systems – ones that freely exchange energy and matter with their surroundings – where:-</p>
<p>1. The free exchange of energy is a regular transfer of air in and out of the tunnels; and</p>
<p>2. The free exchange of mass is a regular travel of hot, loaded trains in and out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>TfL engineers continue to focus on ‘base load’, aka the operational heat, which by definition is year-round, so this can never explain the seasonal nature of the problem. Saloon AC is not a viable solution here, expelling more heat into an already overheated tunnel. We need to be thinking more holistically: rather than the ‘Cooling the Tube Project’ it should be the ‘Cooling the Whole Tube Network in the Summer Project’.</p>
<p>Clearly the root cause of this 100+ year old seasonal problem is the SUN. However, its sheer power to affect every aspect of a network like London’s Tube has been significantly underestimated. In a thermodynamic nutshell:-</p>
<p>1. Radiation from the sun is short wave energy in the form of light, which on striking the earth or a solid object increases their internal energy.</p>
<p>2. This internal energy is in the form of heat and is then re-radiated from the surface of the earth (and solid objects) as long wave heat energy, which in turn warms the ambient air.</p>
<p>The unintentional consequence of the above process in a thermodynamically open system is that hot ambient air plus heat from solar irradiated trains travelling on the surface is carried into the tunnels.</p>
<p>In the context of mixed metro networks, when overground, all external surfaces of the train exposed to the sun, including wheels and bogies, are being directly irradiated. Like any heat conductive surface, the irradiated train body get hot. The sun’s shortwave radiation readily shines through the window glass; then striking the internal surfaces is converted into heat within those materials. However, heat being longwave radiation and, struggling to pass back out through the window glass, is trapped – an unintended ‘greenhouse’ effect. Finally, the undercarriage components consist of massive chunks of metal – usually black – with the ability to absorb immense amounts of heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while rail buckling is a familiar problem, the knock-on effects of the sun on the track beds have never really figured in the context of the network overheating. The whole of the track bed including the rails is absorbing and reflecting heat. So, when trains pass over it, this heat is then reflected outwards and upwards into the wheels, bogies, underside of the carriages, the brakes and traction motors. These get super-heated, not so much through operation, but principally because they are in an overheated environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png" alt="" width="548" height="282" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png 548w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>The above concept graph predicts the build-up of solar irradiation acting on a train, starting early in the day and repeatedly travelling (in this example) the length of the Central Line. The train is irradiated when overground and dissipates a large proportion of that heat load during the underground sections of the journey. However, each irradiated train movement passing throughout the entire network compounds the effect of previous trains, elevating tunnel temperatures even more as the day progresses – rudimentary monitoring has shown saloon temperatures overground typically increase by up to 6°C in 30 mins between Leyton and Epping around 4.30-5.00pm on a summer afternoon.</p>
<p>While the piston-drag effect as the train passes in and out of the tunnel portals will draw in hot ambient air, probably contributing a small amount of heat to the underground sections, compared to the storage-radiator capacity of the train itself, cumulatively dissipating within the tunnel, it is unlikely to be that significant.</p>
<p>Having identified the root causes of overheating and the contributing factors, the task of managing the overheating in the tunnels is actually quite simple – deal with the overheating of the trains on the surface BEFORE THEY ENTER THE TUNNELS.</p>
<p>There are four obvious radiant barrier measures. These are solar-reflective paints (typical surface temperature reductions of 20⁰C) and Low E glass (absorbing some 80% less solar radiation than standard glass), both of which could be easily retroactively applied to existing trains and become the standard for new rolling stock. Then there is green planting on tracks, with its low heat absorption properties compared to ballast and rails. Once in place maintenance costs should be minimal and the benefits considerable. Lastly effective stabling of off-peak trains, providing appropriate solar shade AND ventilation, is imperative.</p>
<p>In conclusion, and most importantly, it should not be forgotten that overheating saloons will adversely affect passenger health and safety. In London’s Tube, this problem would be exacerbated in a ‘stalled-train event’ underground. Passengers overheated in a carriage, within an overheated tunnel, is a potentially fatal matter, especially when temperatures rise, as they often do in summer, to 40°C or higher and where passengers can do nothing but wait until LU staff can direct their escape.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure> <figcaption>I know you want to. - Photo by Author </figcaption></figure> <p>You might not be aware of it, but you use some form of open source software every single day.</p> <p>Every time you start an app on your phone or launch a program on your computer, you profit from the code that someone has written for free.</p> <p>WordPress, the largest and most well-known content management system, is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" rel="nofollow">38% of all websites</a> worldwide. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>Linux is powering <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux" rel="nofollow">30% of all websites</a> globally. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.</p> <p>These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.</p> <p>But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">State of the Octoverse report</a> by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new&nbsp;users joined in 2019 alone!</p> <p>The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.</p> <p>Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.</p> <p>Do you feel the same way?</p> <p>Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now.</p> <h2>You can learn a lot from the source code</h2> <p>Since the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.</p> <p>Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.</p> <p>Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.</p> <p>Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run.</p> <h2>You will work with the smartest people</h2> <p>Compared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.</p> <p>In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.</p> <p>The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.</p> <p>A good example is the well-known code editor <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.</p> <p>You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.</p> <p>When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer.</p> <h2>Your own code could be used globally</h2> <p>Since some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.</p> <p>I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn" rel="nofollow">eslint-plugin-unicorn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte" rel="nofollow">svelte</a>. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.</p> <p>From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment.</p> <h2>Open source projects are inclusive</h2> <p>A great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.</p> <p>While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.</p> <p>Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project.</p> <h2>Projects are starting to become sustainable</h2> <p>The main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.</p> <p>Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.</p> <p>With websites like <a href="https://opencollective.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenCollective</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" rel="nofollow">GitHub Sponsors</a>, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.</p> <p>Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time.</p> <h2>How to contribute to open source</h2> <p>Contributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.</p> <p>Don’t know where to start?</p> <p>Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?</p> <p>It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.</p> <p>It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.</p> <p>The <code>README.md</code> file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.</p> <p>If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://markushatvan.com/blog/contributing-to-open-source-projects-the-right-way">Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way</a>. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.</p> <p>I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time!</p> <h2>Wrapping up</h2> <p>It always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.</p> <p>And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.</p> <p>I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!</p> <p>Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.</p> <h2>Helpful resources</h2> <ul><li><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">The State of the Octoverse</a></li> <li><a

December 26, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.</p>
<p>The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=10
{"items": [...100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>and to continue you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=11
{"items": [...another 100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a simple offset it’ll look like <code>?offset=1000</code> and <code>?offset=1100</code> — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like <code>OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100</code> or will be multiplied by page size (that <code>LIMIT</code> value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.</p>
<p>This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s <em>easy</em> to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.</p>
<p>What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">cursor</a> — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after <strong>that</strong> one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWe"}
</code></pre>
<p>API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWr"}
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say <a href="https://hashids.org/">hashids</a>). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like <code>WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100</code>.</p>
<p>Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;

<p>That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">a great article</a> with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854">tie breaker</a>). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.</p>
<p>One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you. If you've decided to embark upon this journey, here's some advice. </p><h3 id="stop-updating-ios">Stop updating iOS</h3><p>Your best chance of jailbreaking iOS is on older firmware versions. Turn off automatic updates and decline prompts to update iOS.</p><h3 id="backup-shsh-blobs-with-every-new-ios-update">Backup SHSH blobs with every new iOS update</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob">SHSH blobs</a> are the digital signatures that Apple generates and uses to personalize iOS firmware files for each iOS device. Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1). I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver">blobsaver</a> app, but <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/">TSS Saver</a> is a popular alternative.</p><h3 id="learn-about-jailbreaking-and-stay-up-to-date-on-developments">Learn about jailbreaking and stay up to date on developments</h3><p>Developers and hackers are constantly working to break the security of iOS, and new methods to jailbreak iPhones are frequently made public. Stay informed on jailbreak releases by following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak subreddit</a>.</p><p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">exhaustive list of jailbreak compatibility</a> by device and iOS version is also a great resource.</p><p>It's also useful to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Untethered_jailbreak">untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-untethered_jailbreak">semi-untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-tethered_jailbreak">semi-tethered</a>, and <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tethered_jailbreak">tethered</a> jailbreaks.</p><h3 id="recognize-that-this-may-not-work">Recognize that this may not work</h3><p>Depending on your iPhone, you might never be able to jailbreak it or extract Signals decryption key from the iOS Keychain. Apple is making it increasingly difficult to jailbreak iOS devices – improvements to hardware and software are leaving fewer cracks for hackers to exploit.</p><p>Ok, let's get our hands dirty. </p><h2 id="how-to-maybe-backup-signal-for-iphone">How to (maybe) backup Signal for iPhone </h2><p>This guide explains how I was able to backup and extract data from Signal's encrypted SQLite database on an iPhone 7 with iOS 13.6.1. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites </h3><ul><li>Physical access to the iPhone with Signal still installed</li><li>An original iPhone cable</li><li>A Mac or Linux computer</li><li>Patience and a bit of luck</li></ul><p>Shell environments will be differentiated as such. </p><pre><code>// Host machine
$ &lt;command&gt;

// iPhone 
root# &lt;command&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="step-1-jailbreak-ios">Step 1: Jailbreak iOS</h3><p>For iOS 13.6.1 on an iPhone 7, I used <strong>checkra1n</strong> which offers a straight forward semi-tethered jailbreak. Depending on the iPhone device and version of iOS, a jailbreak may or may not be available. </p><p>See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">updated list of iOS jailbreaks</a> for device compatibility and instructions. </p><h3 id="step-2-ssh-into-the-iphone">Step 2: SSH into the iPhone </h3><p>Cydia usually comes with OpenSSH installed and enabled, allowing shell access over IP or USB. If SSH access isn't activated, launch Cydia and install OpenSSH. </p><p><strong>As always, the root password on iOS is <code>alpine</code>.</strong></p><p>If the iPhone and the host machine are on the same network, SSH into the phone using its IP address. It may be found in the phone's WiFi settings. </p><pre><code>$ ssh root@[iphone ip] -p 22</code></pre><p>If SSH over the air isn't possible, USB may be an alternative. However, this involves enabling a proxy service on the host machine.</p><p>First, install <em><em>libimobiledevice</em></em> on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ brew install libimobiledevice</code></pre><p>Then, edit <em><em>com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</em></em> and append the following XML to the file. </p><pre><code>$ nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;com.usbmux.iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;2222&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;22&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;</code></pre><p>And finally, launch the proxy on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><p>It should now be possible to SSH into the iPhone over USB on port <code>2222</code>.</p><pre><code>$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-install-required-packages">Step 3: Install required packages </h3><p>Once logged into to the iPhone's shell, install the following packages as they will come in handy. </p><pre><code>root# apt install zip unzip nano wget</code></pre><h3 id="step-4-backup-the-signal-data-directory">Step 4: Backup the Signal data directory</h3><p><strong>Locate Signal's data directory</strong></p><p>Much like macOS, iOS stores application data in a <em>Library</em>-like directory. In iOS&nbsp;13, its located here <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/</code>. </p><p>Signal's data directory contains the encrypted SQLite database file in <code>./grdb/signal.sqilte</code> and attachments, such as images and videos in <code>./Attachments</code>.</p><p>The data directory may be found by searching the filesystem for Signal's encrypted database file, <code>signal.sqlite</code>.</p><pre><code>root# find / -type f -iname "signal.sqlite"</code></pre><p>That should return something which looks like this:<br><code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/grdb/signal.sqlite</code> </p><p>The Signal directory is: <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></p><p><strong>Zip the Signal directory</strong></p><p>It is recommended to zip the entire directory, not only the database file, as it also contains images and other message attachments. This archive can reach several gigabytes.</p><pre><code>root# cd /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/
root# zip -r signal-backup.zip &lt;Signal directory&gt;

# ex: zip -r signal-backup.zip /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></pre><p><strong>Retrieve the backup on the host machine</strong></p><p>In a new terminal session on the host machine, use <code>scp</code> to copy the backup. </p><pre><code>$ scp -P 22 root@localhost:/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/signal-backup.zip ~/</code></pre><p>Once complete, verify that the backup has fully transferred by unpacking it.</p><p>This is the most complex part of this operation and it helps to have a basic understanding of core iOS development concepts.</p><p><strong>Understanding iOS Entitlements </strong></p><p>From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">Apple Developer Documentation</a>: </p><blockquote>An entitlement is a right or privilege that grants an executable particular capabilities. For example, an app needs the HomeKit Entitlement — along with explicit user consent — to access a user’s home automation network. An app stores its entitlements as key-value pairs embedded in the code signature of its binary executable.</blockquote><p><strong>Enter Keychain Dumper</strong></p><p>We will use <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper"><strong>Keychain-Dumper</strong></a> to attempt extracting the Signal encryption key. It requires entitlements to access Keychain data for any particular app. </p><p>Reading through Keychain-Dumper's GitHub issues, I learned that entitlements changed in iOS 13.5 – prior to this version, an application <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/issues/52#issuecomment-638174691">could be given wildcard entitlements</a>. Changes in 13.5 made it such that apps need specific entitlements. Thankfully, it's possible to update an executable's entitlements, even as a binary.</p><p>The <code>keychain_dumper</code> binary included in its <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper">GitHub repo</a> has wildcard entitlements. We'll need to update them in order to give it permission to decrypt the Signal key.</p><p><strong>Install Keychain Dumper on the iPhone</strong></p><p>Back on the iPhone, download and extract the <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/tag/1.0.0">keychain_dumper binary</a>, and move it to <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p><pre><code>root# wget https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/download/1.0.0/keychain_dumper-1.0.0.zip
root# unzip keychain_dumper-1.0.0.zip
root# mv keychain_dumper /usr/bin</code></pre><p><strong>Update <em>keychain_dumper</em>'s …</strong></p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d54917c3f4c66758a8bd"><div><p>I really believe you have to be careful with data.</p><p>There’s this assumption that if you split test, the data tells you what’s better.</p><p>But that’s clearly not always the case.</p><p>Why?</p><p>This is actually a bigger idea than it seems.</p><p>Many companies that have a data-first approach don’t realize they’re reasoning off of an assumption and treat it like an axiom. [1]</p><p>But optimize long enough and everything becomes the equivalent of BuzzFeed or porn.</p><p>Clickbait, sex, drama, and superficialness. Being everything to everyone and nothing to no one.</p><p>Groupon’s quality went down the drain because Mason’s employees told him sending more emails per day increased revenue.</p><p>The deals became ever lower in quality and users got annoyed.</p><p>There was a time where people<strong> could not wait</strong> to get an email from Groupon. They had killer deals. They had hilarious copywriters. Even if you didn’t buy, getting an email was a treat. But now that it has been properly sterilized to please spineless, risk-averse shareholders, and optimized for maximum quarterly revenue, can you think of a single person that feels that way anymore? Not one person? Groupon clearly has lost its soul, its essence. Mason said in an interview (can’t recall the source) that he wondered if Groupon was meant to be an extraordinary company, just for a smaller market. It certainly would have made it easier to build the company according to his vision rather than something that needed to please the shareholders that needed an IPO to get a return.</p><p>In the early days you had the GOATS like Reid Hoffman (founder LinkedIn), Max Levchin (Paypal and Affirm), and the likes answering questions. Now it’s some 14yr old telling you about the opportunity of a lifetime: screencasting stories from Reddit, having the speech to text tool read them, turn it into a video and put it on YouTube. And then…? Millions I guess?</p><p>It went from THE place to get high-quality courses from knowledgeable instructors to the flea-market of cheap knock-offs and fake guru business opportunity courses. While you can find quality courses there, the overall quality has badly degraded. The best instructors aren’t incentivized to create a course because your $1000 course containing 3 decades of experience will sell for $9.99 of which you’ll get $2.50. So if you actually have something to offer, you’ll go somewhere else, leaving mainly the type of people that game the system in order to make a quick buck.</p><p>People used to LOVE Facebook with a vengeance. Now I have 80 notifications, 40 of which are new friend suggestions of people I’ve never met, 20 are strangers that sent out a blast to get likes for their new page, 17 are events, and 3 are birthdays. [2]</p><p>Oh yeah… and not 1 is actually relevant to me.&nbsp;You can fool a user only so many times before you’ve essentially trained them to ignore you.</p><p><em>They started implementing the same dark patterns with their DM. You get notifications for being friends for a certain time and when you accept a new friend.</em></p><p>In its search for endless optimization, the platform has become bloated and just plain annoying. I can’t think of a single person in my cohort (and younger cohorts) that use FB as much or more as 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The current demographic appears to be the same type of people that use Bing over Google, or Explorer over Chrome. Late adopters that are sticky to defaults.</p><p>So be careful when optimizing. Remember the quantification bias! </p><p><em>Discussed in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/paradigm"><em>Paradigm Shift: Drastically Increase The Odds of Success</em></a></p><p>Just because something is easy to measure doesn’t mean it’s insightful. Just because something can’t be measured easily doesn’t mean it isn’t.</p><p>Remember that business is part art part science: <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/artofbusiness" target="_blank">The Art Of Business, Where Science And Business Depart</a>.</p><p>[1]  I <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/comedy">made the point before</a> when it comes to certain areas that are sufficiently complex (e.g. statistics, data science, economics), you either want no one or a person with extraordinarily deep expertise. </p><p>Interesting piece on the fraud that’s going on in Data Science: <a href="https://logicmag.io/intelligence/interview-with-an-anonymous-data-scientist/"><em>The Smart, the Stupid, and the Catastrophically Scary: An Interview with an Anonymous Data Scientist</em></a></p><p>What you don’t want is someone that knows enough to bullshit you but not enough to get it right. An indicator that you might have the right person is the phrase: ‘‘I’m not sure’’ or ‘‘ it depends on…’’. In these fields, the vast majority of so-called experts add no value at best or negative value at worst.</p><p>[2] This is what I admired so much about Systrom’s and Krieger’s Instagram. Their almost zen-like essentialism. No bloating, no fluff, trying very hard to take away things as they did about adding things. How many new features did they launch in a month before their Facebook acquisition? How many new features does IG launch now per month? </p><p>I’m not saying adding new features is bad. I’m also not saying that a company shouldn’t scale. The point I’m making is that entropy is real. It’s much easier for your product to become worse, than it is to become better. So if that’s not a core focus, it probably won’t happen by accident.</p><p>But scale and improvements in user love (which follow from a better service/product) are not mutually exclusive. Apple provides a data point. Especially during the Jobs reign. </p><p><em>More on this in the essay series: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a><em> </em></p></div></div></div>]]>

	<p>In 2020, <strong>Docker is the best medium for distributing and running most developer-facing software</strong>. It’s widely accepted that Docker is great for building and deploying the artifacts for your enterprise web app, but this is less well known when it comes to things like developer tools. However, running tools in containers has many benefits over installing and running them in the conventional way, and we should all start doing it more.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I install very few things on either my personal or work computer. I don’t have <code>terraform</code>, <code>aws</code>, <code>node</code>, or <code>pip</code> installed, but I use them all the time. I have a Docker image for each, and I run them in containers with minimal privileges. I’m definitely <a href="https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles">not the only one</a>, but it’s not as popular as it should be. None of these tools actually need full access to my computer to do their work, but that is normally how they’re run.</p>
<p>Here are some benefits of running these tools in Docker.</p>
<h4 id="cross-platform">Cross-platform</h4>
<p>At this point in time, Docker is ubiquitous and you get cross-platform support for free, thanks to Docker Inc’s investments in that area (Docker for Mac &amp; Windows). This is useful both for people developing/distributing tools, and for people working on a team that needs to share tooling. You have one Docker image and it will run pretty much everywhere. OS package managers can be great, but they’re very much not cross-platform. Things like <code>pip install</code> will sometimes work cross-platform, but have other serious drawbacks.</p>
<p>While every platform has its own sandboxing mechanisms, running with Docker lets you specify runtime context and enforce a sandbox in a cross-platform way, which is useful when you expect anybody else to run the same command as you.</p>
<h4 id="sandboxed">Sandboxed</h4>
<p>When you <code>docker run</code>, you have to be explicit about privileges. A container is mostly sandboxed and unprivileged by default. It doesn’t have access to ambient environment variables. It doesn’t have access to the host system’s disk. A tool like <code>jq</code> just needs to read stdin and print to stdout. It doesn’t need access to my shell’s environment variables (or, if it does, I explicitly pass those through to the container). <code>yarn</code> should be fine operating on just the working directory, and maybe a cache directory. I don’t want it to have access to my ~/.aws directory (for <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/01/malicious-npm-package-exfiltrating-data-from-unix-systems/">obvious reasons</a>).</p>
<p>Some tools do need access to things. I want my <code>aws</code> CLI to be able to read ~/.aws, so I grant that explicitly. This makes running the tool more verbose but less magical.</p>
<h4 id="simple-uniform-interface">Simple, uniform interface</h4>
<p>Running a program in a container is a lot like running it normally, but the user doesn’t need to jump through hoops to configure the system, build and install. The developer of the image jumps through those hoops and produces a runnable artifact with a simple interface. That interface is the same whether the tool was written in Python or Rust or C or anything else.</p>
<p>Downloading a pre-compiled binary is almost like this, except with worse odds. Maybe there’s a build for your architecture. If it was statically linked, you’re golden. Otherwise, use <code>ldd</code> to reverse engineer the fact that you need to install <code>libjpeg</code>.</p>
<p>A Docker image “just works”. It comes bundled with what it needs to run.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it’s pretty strange to execute <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/tree/0b3d9a4260fdda5c6a8b736439e0776bc2252f41#installation"><code>pip install awscli</code></a>. It’s immaterial to an end user that the tool is written in Python, and requiring him or her to set up and use Python tooling doesn’t make sense. I don’t mean to pick on <code>pip</code> or <code>awscli</code> in particular, but this is a poor mechanism for distributing non-library software. It leaves <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+pip">far too much to chance</a>. It’s a clumsy and leaky interface for tool distribution. So is <code>npm install</code>. So is telling somebody to install your tool by installing golang, and then running <code>go build</code>. No, thanks. If I’m hacking on the project, then by all means. But don’t foist that on end users.</p>
<h4 id="facilitates-version-pinning">Facilitates version pinning</h4>
<p>When collaborating, it’s important that people run the same versions of software to get consistent results. Version pinning is essential to that. Pinning dependency manifests is good, but it’s not enough: it only covers the one situation of installing things with a language package manager. It may not cover using the same linter version, or the same version of <code>node</code>, <code>aws</code>, <code>ansible</code>, <code>terraform</code>, or any libraries installed at the OS level. Invoking <code>docker run node:13.10.1</code>, instead of whatever the user happens to have installed as <code>node</code>, solves this problem in general. Having the ability to specify the versions at the point of use, rather than out-of-band as part of some other installation process, is also convenient and tidy.</p>
<p>It’s easy to run different versions of a tool side by side with Docker. Docker solves this more generally than things like virtualenv for Python, rvm for Ruby, etc. You specify what version of the tool to use when you’re invoking it, and it pins a whole lot of context more than just the tool’s version, which is always preferable for reproducibility.</p>
<p>In one recent situation at work, we had a test case start failing when we upgraded our runtime from Python 3.6.5 to Python 3.6.8. Having the ability to easily run the tests with any version of Python made it easy to bisect and identify a change in 3.6.7 as the cause. This could have been debugged without Docker, but it was particularly natural and easy with Docker.</p>
<h4 id="reproducible">Reproducible</h4>
<p>Invoking a tool with <code>docker run</code> should specify everything needed to reproducibly run it somewhere else. It’s running some specific version of the tool? Okay. It needs my AWS credentials? Okay. It needs some specific combination of environment variables set? Okay.</p>
<p>I cringe when I see a Makefile or build instructions saying to run <code>yarn</code> or <code>terraform</code> or <code>go</code>. What version? What’s being assumed about my environment? Maybe this worked on your <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html">unique snowflake of a machine</a> 18 months ago, but good luck with it now. (My laptop is a unique snowflake too. Everyone’s is, until we all figure out how to use NixOS.)</p>
<p>Running tools in Docker, there are few expectations of the runtime environment beyond having Docker installed. All the other requirements should be made explicit in the <code>docker run</code> command. The command that you’re running locally will work the same on your colleague’s machine, and in any CI with minimal configuration (or none). This is absolutely critical, especially when working on a team. This is a far more robust approach than expecting (requiring) anybody’s system, or a CI slave, to be set up “just so”.</p>
<h4 id="minimizes-global-state">Minimizes global state</h4>
<p>I have very few things installed on my host system beyond the base OS. There’s less to remember when setting up a new machine, fewer things to go wrong during upgrades, and fewer opportunities for conflicts over shared libraries.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h4 id="one-offs">One-offs</h4>
<p>I have bash aliases for a bunch of tools that I run all the time. These are just for my own convenience. For anything shared with other people, I’d use a project’s Makefile (see below).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Some basics</strong></p>
<pre><code>alias aws='docker run --rm -v ~/.aws:/.aws -v "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" -u 1000:1000 -e AWS_PROFILE mikesir87/aws-cli:1.18.11 aws'
alias jq='docker run -i --rm jess/jq jq'
alias terraform='docker run -it --rm -v ~/.aws:/.aws -v "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" -u 1000:1000 hashicorp/terraform:0.12.23'
</code></pre><p>With these aliases, I can <code>AWS_PROFILE=... aws sts get-caller-identity | jq -r .Arn</code> as if they were “really” installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zoom</strong></p>
<p>Here’s zoom (video conferencing):</p>
<pre><code>alias zoom='xhost +local:docker \
    &amp;&amp; docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY \
    --device /dev/video0 --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd --device /dev/dri -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm \
    -v ~/.config/zoom/.zoom:/root/.zoom -v ~/.config/zoom/.config/zoomus.conf:/root/.config/zoomus.conf \
    jess/zoom-us'
</code></pre><p>Notice that <a href="https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5">port 19421</a> remains stubbornly closed unless we explicitly let the container claim it on the host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Snes9x</strong></p>
<p>I do this with other stuff, too. Here’s Snes9x (can you imagine <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?t=23603">installing it</a>?):</p>
<pre><code>alias snes9x='docker run -it --rm -u 1000:1000 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY \
    -v /run/dbus:/run/dbus -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm \
    --device /dev/snd --device /dev/dri --device /dev/input/js0 \
    -e PULSE_SERVER=unix:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pulse/native -v $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pulse/native:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pulse/native \
    --group-add $(getent group audio | cut -d: -f3) \
    -v ~/.config/snes9x:/.snes9x/ -v ~/Games/SNES:/SNES -v ~/.local/share:/.local/share \
    danniel/snes9x'
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>
<p>For things that are project-specific, or in a team setting, all useful commands should be codified in something like a Makefile. This wraps the complexity and verbosity of the <code>docker run</code> incantations, makes it possible to share them easily, and makes them passably ergonomic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>hugo</strong></p>
<p>When I’m writing an article for this site, I run <code>make hugo-watch</code> and load http://localhost:1313 in a web browser:</p>
<pre><code>hugo = docker run --rm -u $$(id -u):$$(id -g) -v "$$(pwd)":/src -v "$$(pwd)"/output:/target $(2) klakegg/hugo:0.54.0-ext-alpine $(1)

hugo-watch:
    mkdir -p output
    $(call hugo, server, -it -p 1313:1313)
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p><strong>prettier</strong></p>
<p>To format a JavaScript project, we might have the make targets</p>
<pre><code>prettier = docker run -i --rm -v "$$(pwd)":"$$(pwd)" -w "$$(pwd)" elnebuloso/prettier:1.19.1 $(1) "src/**/*.js"

format:
    $(call prettier)

format-check:
    $(call prettier, --check)
</code></pre><p>We would run <code>make format</code> to format the code and <code>make format-check</code> to check the style. It runs on my Linux box, it runs on my colleague’s Mac, and it runs in any Docker-equipped CI. None of those machines need to have <code>node</code>, <code>npm</code>, or <code>prettier</code> installed. We completely trivialize the issues of versioning and of synchronizing our environments: the version is specified once, here in the Makefile, and it’s obeyed everywhere.</p>
<p>In a language like Python, where libraries are forced to fight to the death for control of transitive dependency versions, lifting a tool like <code>black</code> or <code>flake8</code> out of the project’s requirements.txt, and into a self-contained Docker image, can be a big …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

    <p>The past few months have seen a rise in volatility along the Indo-Tibetan border, with the forces of both India and China coming to blows. While these events are extraordinary in present times, the border has witnessed far more heated exchanges, most notably during the 1962 <a href="https://www.livehistoryindia.com/in-the-news/2020/06/21/across-the-karakorams">Indo-China</a> War.</p><p>The unforgiving terrain that marks the frontier creates an additional dimension to the already complex nature of these clashes, whether in regard to more conventional manoeuvres, or other irregular military activity which is far more frequent. This is the story of the latter kind of action, that of daring espionage against Communist China, played for the highest stakes with the greatest risks.</p>

Straddling between the <a href="https://www.livehistoryindia.com/snapshort-histories/2017/06/21/kumaon-echoes-of-the-past">Kumaon</a> and Garhwal districts of Uttarakhand, deep in the Himalayas, stands Nanda Devi. The second-highest mountain in India, towering at an astonishing 25,646 feet, it is named after the patron goddess of Uttarakhandâ€” the mountain being her temporal manifestation.</p><p>Its unique topographical environment makes it one of the most inaccessible places on Earth. Surrounded on three sides by massive mountain rampartsâ€”its natural fortifications measuring at no point below 17,000 feetâ€” only the narrow and dangerously steep Rishi Ganga river gorge allows access to it. The mountain in itself is a citadel of rock and ice, with steep, angled faces and avalanche-prone ridges guarding its summit. Its immense proportions make it far tougher to climb than Everest. It is at once a supremely magnificent and terrifyingly intimidating mountain.</p>

    <p>For much of the 19th and early 20th century, before it was finally summited in 1936, it was considered to be the third pole â€“ a point of virtual inaccessibility. However, this awe-inspiring creation of nature shelters a device, abhorrent to nature, manufactured by man. Somewhere high on the harrowing slopes of Nanda Devi, buried deep in snow, lies a lost nuclear listening device slowly depleting its plutonium cores. Containing 5kg of plutonium â€“ 1 kg less than the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki â€“ with a predicted lifespan of 900 years, this nuclear trespasser has been forfeited to the mountain forever.</p><p>This is the story behind one of the most audacious acts of espionage in the 20th century.</p>

    <p><strong>Cold War In High Places</strong></p><p>The year was 1965, and the Cold War was reaching its apogee, with America stretching its geopolitical reach to all corners of the world in order to counter the communist influence. Closer to home, the War of â€™62 had left India intensely wary of its neighbour, China. To add fuel to simmering embers, China carried out its first nuclear test in 1964 in Xinjiang, a province that borders the northern tip of India. In this atmosphere of intense mutual suspicion and paranoia, the Pentagon began concocting a plan that would help both India and America keep a closer eye on China, especially with regard to its nuclear programme.</p><p>With satellites that could gather useful photographic intelligence still a few years away, Americaâ€™s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) along with the Indian Intelligence Bureau (IB) planned on placing a powerful listening device at a point of extreme prominence along the Indo-Tibetan border. The site where the device would be placed was key as it would need to have uninterrupted access in order to intercept Chinese radio signals. This meant it would have to be positioned on a mountain that was high as well as close to the Tibetan plateau. With an unparalleled height advantage and an unobstructed view of China from its summit, there was no better choice than Nanda Devi.</p>

    <p>A System for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) generator was designed so that it would power the telemetry functions of the device, a power unit similar to the ones being used in space at the time.</p><p>It was within the SNAP that seven plutonium fuel rods would be stored, made from a compound of Pu-238 and Pu-239. Once activated, the SNAP would constantly be converting radioactive heat energy created by the rods into electricity, which would power the multiple-sensor device as well as its six-foot-long antenna.</p><p>With the technical aspect settled, the question of who would carry and set up all this equipment remained. Only two expeditions had summited the mountain up until then, and more than a few climbers had died. There was no doubt that only the very best mountaineers could be trusted to carry a nuclear payload up one of the most difficult mountains in the world.</p>

    <p>A group of 14 American and four Indian mountaineers was assembled. In totality, they represented the cream of a mountaineering generation. Among the Americans, some of the more famous climbers were Dr Robert Schaller, Tom Frost and Jim McCarthy. The Indian contingent consisted of Captain M S Kohli, Sonam Wangyal, H C S Rawat and G S Bhangu. All four had been members of the successful 1965 Indian Everest Expedition, which had put a record nine climbers on the summit. They were in fact enlisted for this covert expedition just a few days after returning from Everest. Together, the entire group was no less than a mountaineering dream team.</p><p>After having sworn their respective oaths of secrecy, the climbing team was flown to Mount McKinley in Alaska, the highest mountain in North America, to prepare for the arduous expedition ahead. While all of them were without doubt among the most experienced climbers at the time, they were rather new to the more idiosyncratic aspect of the expedition â€“ that of dealing with nuclear material.</p><p>American climber Jim McCarthy was appointed as the designated member of the team who would handle the plutonium rods. Through the summer of 1965, officials from Americaâ€™s Atomic Energy Commission trained McCarthy to load and unload the device without disturbing its deadly occupant. Other team members were briefed on the dangers of their special load as well, and ways to ensure minimum exposure to the deadly radioactive isotopes.</p><p>All climbers were going to be paid $1,000 per month, a hefty amount in the 1960s. While there would be personal gratification from having been of service to their respective nations, they were on no account to tell anyone about the nature of their expedition. The cover for the entire team was that they were a joint Indo-American mountaineering team conducting research for high-altitude flight for the American Air Force. Before departing for India, the covert operation was finally given its official codename: Operation Hat.</p>

    <p><strong>Into the Sanctuary of the Goddess</strong></p><p>In an effort to attract minimal attention, most of the mountaineers were flown into base camp by helicopter in September 1965. However, the climbing equipment, rations, and of course the listening device itself â€” stored inside a solid lead casket â€” were transported in the time-honoured fashion, carried by nearly 150 <em>dotial</em> porters through the Rishi Ganga gorge. The special load did not go unnoticed among the porters, and apart from its unusual weight, many of them alleged to have felt heat emanating from the casket. Mounted on poles, some climbers later noted its uncanny resemblance to the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, in the manner it was transported as well as the supreme power it possessed.</p><p>After having established themselves at the base of the mountain, the mountaineers methodically began making their way up Nanda Devi. Establishing a series of camps along the climbing route, the team was finally positioned to make an attempt on the summit in the middle of October. It was then that catastrophe struck.</p><p>A violent storm hit the mountain and made it impossible to continue. The summit team, along with the device, was encamped just 2,000 feet below their objective. The extreme conditions, however, greatly endangered their position. Keeping in mind the extreme volatility of such storms, Captain Kohli â€” the leader of the climbing team â€” called for an immediate retreat.</p>

    <p>Carrying the 56 kg listening device in deteriorating weather conditions at 23,000 feet was going to be a Herculean task. Prioritising the need for a quick descent to minimise the risk to the lives of his fellow climbers, Kohli decided to ditch the equipment in the high camp. He reasoned that another expedition could always be mounted when weather conditions improved, in order to retrieve the device. On the other hand, the life of a fellow climber was irreplaceable.</p><p>Thus, with all the climbers having safely descended, the expedition came to an end. Being late in the year, the weather window to climb Nanda Devi was now closed. Any new expedition would have to bide their time till the following year. The nuclear device too, abandoned on a high precipice of the mountain, would have to wait.</p><p><strong>Plan B</strong></p><p>With the arrival of spring in 1966, a second expedition was launched to locate the equipment, and most importantly the nuclear device, that had been left the previous autumn. The composition of the climbing team was more or less the same, and soon they were scouring the slopes of Nanda Devi, trying to find their highly valuable and potentially dangerous belongings. But it was all …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: Google has gotten bad; we all know it; ideas for a startup making a better Google.]</p> <p>In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.</p> <p>They aren’t using DuckDuckGo either. They’re still using Google.com, but differently. To make Google usable, users are adding faux-query modifiers that to supress the “garbage Internet”.</p> <p>You see this in the typeahead logs.</p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image6.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Products (Reddit)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image4.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Services (Reddit, Yelp)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image1.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Movies (Rotten Tomatoes)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image5.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Even code (Github)</em></center> <p>Interestingly, this doesn’t work for all categories. <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image3.png" alt=""> <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image2.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Recipes don’t have a “Reddit” equivalent</em></center> <h3 id="query-operators-mean-somethings-broken">Query Operators Mean Something’s Broken</h3> <p>More advanced users use modifiers like <code>site: filetype: intitle:</code> because adding “reddit” isn’t strict enough, as spammy websites often manipulate content to win SEO.</p> <p>How about those websites that stuff the year in the title? “Reviews UPDATED JANUARY 2020” are exploiting the fact that customers suffix queries with the year. What those people are trying to command is freshness, not a title match.</p> <p>Something’s broken, and a tiny share of Google is open for the taking. Obviously attacking incumbents head-on doesn’t work. Here are two alternative ideas for bootstrapping next-generation search:</p> <h3 id="1-boogle-a-query-reformulator">#1 Boogle, A Query Reformulator</h3> <p>Introducing Boogle, a proxy for Google that’s just Better Google Search. It’s a query expander. We predict the correct operators for your query, proxy Google’s results, and serve. For example:</p> <p><code>query("stripe.js example") -&gt; query("stripe.js example (site:github.com OR site:gitlab.com OR site:..."))</code></p> <p><code>query("is anker charger") -&gt; query("is anker charger (inurl:forum OR site:reddit.com OR ...))"</code></p> <p>Query topic modeling is a rich science with plenty of examples.</p> <p>You’d almost as fast as Google, never worse, and occasionally better. This will help build the reflex to use you instead. This approach isn’t that hard to get started with, and might work for the high-end users.</p>  <p>You could go after this vertical by vertical – build the <em>best</em> site for electric product search, for travel, for code, etc. A key question is how to build habitual recall to use your product over Google. Amazon and Airbnb both enjoy a huge amount of direct traffic. Some learnings from those:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stellar mobile destination.</strong> Using Airbnb directly feels more fluid and fun than using Google for Airbnb.</li> <li><strong>The 90% Rule.</strong> To build reflex you need to give me what I want most of the time.** **With Prime, Amazon made it such that we stopped price comparing across other sites; Amazon would get it to us fastest, and that turns out to matter more than price. Most of the time you open Amazon.app, it satisfies.</li> <li><strong>Come for search, stay for something else.</strong> I don’t think of Airbnb or Amazon as search apps. They help me get things or book homes. You might want to your search app to be a destination for something else. This is where I think community comes in.</li> </ul> <p>Picking a vertical that <em>doesn’t</em> have strong typeahead completions[1] would help you build community around your search engine. Recipes, fitness, fashion, etc. don’t have decacorn conglomerates like Github or Reddit. That might mean it’s easier to build community around them, and put your flagship search engine on top.</p> <hr> <p>If you’re working on this kind of stuff, try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> or just shoot me an email – daniel@pioneer.app.</p> <hr> <p>[1] In reality I’d pick the vertical _I _love most. If you’re a guitar player start with music; a movie buff should build better Rotten Tomatos. Etc.</p> </article></div>]]>

December 26, 2020 | https://www.swyx.io/make-your-own-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.swyx.io/make-your-own-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I read a list of <a href="https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/">Things You're Allowed To Do</a> on Hacker News recently. These are useful reminders for a well paid, technical audience, but one thing stuck out to me: <strong>It didn't mention making your own tools</strong>. Not even once.</p>
<p>Even the greatest software has parts that aren't so great for you. But the difference between you and everyone else is that you can code.</p>
<p>Here's a list of tools (<em>that you don't need anyone's permission</em>) to code for yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You can make your own Stylesheet</strong>: Long before <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1336363173838909441">GitHub got Dark Mode</a>, developers had been making their own with the <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus">Stylus Userstyles Manager</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>You can make your own Query Generator</strong>: Most platforms have advanced features that are poorly documented and don't have good UIs. You can make your own. I made my own <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1328086859356913664?s=20">Advanced Twitter Search UI</a> embedding all the little tips and tricks that people pass around by word of mouth. I know of two ongoing attempts to <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1335627133956153344">do the same for Google's advanced operators</a>.
    
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jntu0l1zk2o3xz8bu5fz.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </li>
  <li><strong>You can make an Inspo Generator</strong>: Projects like <a href="https://whattotweet.com/">What to Tweet</a>, <a href="https://components.ai/">Components.ai</a> and <a href="https://www.doodlestrudel.com/">Doodle Strudel</a> get ridiculously popular compared to their technical complexity - because inspiration loves combinatorial explosions!</li>
  <li><strong>You can make your own scripts</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts#hacker-scripts">Like this guy</a>. Developers have apparently been automating coffee machines for so long that I recently learned that the infamous <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418">HTTP Error 418</a> was inspired by an actual real life situation.</li>
  <li><strong>You can make your own CLIs</strong>: CLIs are essentially interactive scripts. If you do JavaScript, I made a course on Egghead about <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-custom-command-line-interface-cli-tooling-with-oclif-and-typescript?af=95qfq1">building custom CLIs with oclif and TypeScript</a>!</li>
  <li>
    <strong>You can make personal proxies</strong>: Frustrated with slow searches (I am often on mobile 3G), <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25538586">gamed search results</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1341583883947544578?s=20">assorted crap in my URLs</a>, I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1342625544320339969">made my own Google Search proxy</a>. A proxy is different from "just the UI", because it involves setting up a server or serverless function to process data for you. Because you have total control of server data, you have the ability to postprocess, combine, persist, and optimize it for your specific preferences. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/dataprivacy-linkedin-datascraping-idUSL2N2GM1ZV">Scraping public data is probably legal</a>, but personal means personal - Be careful about sharing it with others and definitely do not sell it. But this is ethically no different than setting up your own <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>.
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/56r2dhdtgq8qw3qsi3jo.png" alt="Alt Text">
    <blockquote>
      <p>My personal <a href="https://github.com/sw-yx/automation/">cheatsheet of automation resources is available here</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas are great, scoped projects that let you try out new languages and frameworks and improve your quality of life as a side effect. Always wanted to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/svelte-why/">try Svelte</a>? Make a query generator! Want a new CLI? <a href="https://deno.land/posts/v1.6">Deno ships binaries now!</a> <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a> claims to be an Open Source Firebase Alternative? Put it to the test!</p>
<p>And there's a compounding effect to these as you make them. More often than not, the lessons you learn from making a tool for yourself will find their way into your work. If you get <em>really</em> lucky - <a href="https://medium.com/who-what-why/how-side-projects-saved-our-startup-a83a80f3b3ae">your side projects might even become your life's work</a>.</p>
<p>Don't take it from me. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1140259247680315393?s=20">Dan Abramov</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s a thing that I learned at FB that I wish I knew much earlier. Invest in building custom tools!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>You might think only bigcos make custom tools. But a tool doesn’t have to be sophisticated. It can be a script you could write in a day. And at small and medium companies, even a little effort can yield a huge return. Because <strong>nobody optimized anything yet</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beauty of specializing in moving bits instead of atoms is that we can iterate in minutes, rather than months. That's a skill that customers pay us handsomely for, and we should remember that we can simply be our own customers too.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Author's Note: I wrote a longer treatment of the benefits of, and ideas for, Side Projects in <a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/">The Coding Career Handbook</a>. I also commented in <a href="https://www.thekeycuts.com/dear-analyst-50-walking-through-a-vba-script-for-trading-billions-of-dollars-worth-of-derivatives-with-shawn-wang/">the KeyCuts podcast</a> on how all young finance traders make their own pricing tools as a rite of passage — like how <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Knighting_ceremony/Legends#New_Jedi_Order">Jedi make their own lightsabers</a> before becoming Jedi Knights.</p>

  <p>If you are making a DevTools startup, I am <a href="https://codingcareer.circle.so/c/devtools">incubating a small community in DX Circle</a>, my proto-blog for investing in Developer Tools and Developer Communities.</p>

It's so elitist.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>I have an internal dialogue going all the time trying to convince myself that I don't want my work to be called science. What I do is completely different, more sacred, honest and open and yes sometimes flawed. Sometimes I hide the fact that I have a Ph.D. because I don’t want it to be a symbol of authority or intelligence for myself. It also feels douchey to tell people I have a Ph.D. I want to be judged by my actions, not where I went to school, which can be primarily determined by your parents financial status and education level. I grew up on a farm in rural Indiana. We ate eggs from our chickens and drank dehydrated milk. Up until even high school my family was dirt poor. We had our electricity shut-off and had to take cold showers. When we couldn't afford the phone bill, I walked to 7-11 and used the payphone to call my friends. Violence, evictions, car repossessions — you name it, I’ve lived it. Starting undergrad at SIU I was homeless and lived out of my car and slept on the dorm room floors of people I knew.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was in graduate school, 99% of my peers did not come from a similar background. It was abundantly clear that the practice of science and medicine is only accessible to the upper crust. That’s an issue in itself, but the <b><i>f</i></b><i><b>ucking humongous gigantic bigger problem</b></i> is that cutting-edge medicines are also only available to the societal elite. Time and time again throughout this pandemic, we’ve watched as the wealthy and powerful get all the unapproved drugs to treat their covid, while all of us peasants sit back and do our best not to die without them. The 108 Regeneron antibody cocktails all went to Washington DC.</p><p>That’s why I left academia. Why I quit my job at NASA and started doing science as a biohacker. I want everyone to be able to do science without any gatekeepers. The single greatest impediment to diversity in science is access to knowledge and information that is being held tighter than Ric Flair’s Figure Four Leg Lock.</p><p><b><span>Biohackers are setting knowledge free.</span></b></p><p>In May 2020, an article came out in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/806">science magazine</a> where researchers showed that by using a DNA vaccine that codes for the SARS-COV2 spike protein, they could create antibodies that provide protection from covid-19 in macaque monkeys without harmful side-effects. Getting good monkey data is basically the best pre-human data you can ever hope to get. Most people only have experimental data from mouse tests. When I see a paper like this the gears in my brain begin to spin because there is a good chance the FDA would approve this for human testing.</p><p>So, I decided to test it myself. The project perfectly fit a niche where biohackers have an experimental advantage over academia and industry. With enough knowledge and skill, we could perform quick but data-laden experiments to show whether the same DNA vaccine tested on monkeys would be promising in humans. And instead of taking months or years we could have results in as little as a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>I brought up the idea with David Ishee and Dariia Dantseva, fellow members of the biohacking group the <a href="http://the-cdc.com/" target="_blank">Central Dogma Collective (CDC)</a>. They also thought that based on the data this would be a fucking crazy project. We decided <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNAhY1w2w78rSeNQo_e0dQ2w8mmGEg7Mr">we would live-stream</a> every step so that people could learn how to do advanced biomedical research like this in their own home. If one were to replicate the experiment from scratch, the total individual cost would end up being around $3500, the major costs being $1600 for DNA synthesis and $1200 for the kits to measure coronavirus spike protein antibodies.</p><p>What I really wanted was to show people how to do the science. I didn't really care if it worked or not but I tend to be pessimistic about my own experiments anyway. While testing and creating a successful coronavirus vaccine would send a powerful message to the world, teaching people how to do advanced biomedical research will change it.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the experiment worked. All three of us developed SARS-CoV2 spike protein neutralizing antibodies. I still can't fucking believe it. Not only did we create and test a successful vaccine, we showed that we could get a gene therapy to work (a DNA vaccine changes the DNA in your cells and so is a gene therapy also). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTuRBuy74KlaBzLrd0aTZl852nhPNCWL06aB7wY1JKk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a summary of the experimental details and results</a> if you are interested. We didn't create the vaccine to sell it. We made the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SracILuRbiZt4f7EVH2JBvefaHmsOUsC?usp=sharing" target="_blank">nucleotide sequence and genetic design data open and free</a> so that anyone can easily recreate it. All in a state-of-the-art lab. I'm kidding, my lab is a tiny bedroom in a house in West Oakland, David's is in a shed in rural Mississippi and Dariia's is an old building she converted in Ukraine. If your mind isn't blown, you either already knew about the project or you don't understand what I just told you.&nbsp;</p><p><b><span>If you want to know why I created and tested a coronavirus vaccine on myself, it’s because I am at War.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>I know it sounds a bit dramatic but there really is a class war going on. There is a group of people who are actively making choices that cause a disproportionate amount of deaths among those in lower social classes. New gene therapies cost over a million dollars. That’s right. Your life, your child’s life, your mother, your loved one depends on how much money you make.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I want the Dunning-Kruger effect to be real. First described in<a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.77.6.1121"> a seminal 1999 paper</a> by David Dunning and Justin Kruger, this effect has been the darling of journalists who want to explain why dumb people don’t know they’re dumb. There’s even<a href="https://youtu.be/BdnH19KsVVc"> video of a fantastic pastiche</a> of Turandot’s famous aria, <i>Nessun dorma,</i> explaining the Dunning-Kruger effect. “They don’t know,” the opera singer belts out at the climax, “that they don’t know.”</p>

<p>I was planning on writing a very short article about the Dunning-Kruger effect and it felt like shooting fish in a barrel. Here’s the effect, how it was discovered, what it means. End of story.</p>

<p>But as I double-checked the academic literature, doubt started to creep in. While trying to understand the criticism that had been leveled at the original study, I fell down a rabbit hole, spoke to a few statistics-minded people, corresponded with Dr. Dunning himself, and tried to understand if our brain really was biased to overstate our competence in activities at which we suck... or if the celebrated effect was just a mirage brought about by the peculiar way in which we can play with numbers.</p>

<p>Have we been overstating our confidence in the Dunning-Kruger effect?</p>

<h5><b>A misunderstood effect</b></h5>

<p>The most important mistake people make about the Dunning-Kruger effect, according to Dr. Dunning, has to do with who falls victim to it. “The effect is about us, not them,” he wrote to me. “The lesson of the effect was always about how we should be humble and cautious about ourselves.” The Dunning-Kruger effect is not about dumb people. It’s mostly about all of us when it comes to things we are not very competent at.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the Dunning-Kruger effect was originally defined as a bias in our thinking. If I am terrible at English grammar and am told to answer a quiz testing my knowledge of English grammar, this bias in my thinking would lead me, according to the theory, to believe I would get a higher score than I actually would. And if I excel at English grammar, the effect dictates I would be likely to slightly underestimate how well I would do. I might predict I would get a 70% score while my actual score would be 90%. But if my actual score was 15% (because I’m terrible at grammar), I might think more highly of myself and predict a score of 60%. This discrepancy is the effect, and it is thought to be due to a specific problem with our brain’s ability to assess its skills.</p>

<p>This is what student participants went through for Dunning and Kruger’s research project in the late 1990s. There were assessments of grammar, of humour, and of logical reasoning. Everyone was asked how well they thought they did and everyone was also graded objectively, and the two were compared.</p>

<p>Since then, many studies have been done that have reported this effect in other domains of knowledge. Dr. Dunning tells me he believes the effect “has more to do with being <i>misinformed</i> rather than uninformed.” If I am asked the boiling point of mercury, it is clear my brain does not hold the answer. But if I am asked what is the capital of Scotland, I may think I know enough to say Glasgow, but it turns out it’s Edinburgh. That’s misinformation and it’s pushing down on that confidence button in my brain.</p>

<p>So case closed, right? On the contrary. In 2016 and 2017, two papers were published in a mathematics journal called <i>Numeracy</i>. In them, the authors argued that the Dunning-Kruger effect was a mirage. And I tend to agree.</p>

<h5><b>The effect is in the noise</b></h5>

<p>The<a href="https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/numeracy/vol9/iss1/art4/"> two</a><a href="https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/numeracy/vol10/iss1/art4/"> papers</a>, by Dr. Ed Nuhfer and colleagues, argued that the Dunning-Kruger effect could be replicated by using random data. “We all then believed the [1999] paper was valid,” Dr. Nuhfer told me via email. “The reasoning and argument just made so much sense. We never set out to disprove it; we were even fans of that paper.” In Dr. Nuhfer’s own papers, which used both computer-generated data and results from actual people undergoing a science literacy test, his team disproved the claim that most people that are unskilled are unaware of it (“a small number are: we saw about 5-6% that fit that in our data”) and instead showed that both experts and novices underestimate and overestimate their skills with the same frequency. “It’s just that experts do that over a narrower range,” he wrote to me.</p>

<p>Wrapping my brain around all this took weeks. I recruited a husband-and-wife team, Dr. Patrick E. McKnight (from the Department of Psychology at George Mason University, also on the advisory board of Sense About Science and STATS.org) and Dr. Simone C. McKnight (from Global Systems Technologies, Inc.), to help me understand what was going on. Patrick McKnight not only believed in the existence of the Dunning-Kruger effect: he was teaching it to warn his students to be mindful of what they actually knew versus what they thought they knew. But after replicating Dr. Nuhfer’s findings using a different platform (the statistical computing language R instead of Nuhfer’s Microsoft Excel), he became convinced the effect was just an artefact of how the thing that was being measured was indeed measured.</p>

<p>We had long conversations over this as I kept pushing back. As a skeptic, I am easily enticed by stories of the sort “everything you know about this is wrong.” That’s my bias. To overcome it, I kept playing devil’s advocate with the McKnights to make sure we were not forgetting something. Every time I felt my understanding crystallize, doubt would creep in the next day and my discussion with the McKnights would resume.</p>

<p>I finally reached a point where I was fairly certain the Dunning-Kruger effect had not been shown to be a bias in our thinking but was just an artefact. Here then is the simplest explanation I have for why the effect appears to be real.</p>

<p>For an effect of human psychology to be real, it cannot be rigorously replicated using random noise. If the human brain was predisposed to choose heads when a coin is flipped, you could compare this to random predictions (heads or tails) made by a computer and see the bias. A human would call more heads than the computer would because the computer is making random bets whereas the human is biased toward heads. With the Dunning-Kruger effect, this is not the case. Random data actually mimics the effect really well.</p>

<p>The effect as originally described in 1999 makes use of a very peculiar type of graph. “This graph, to my knowledge, is quite unusual for most areas of science,” Patrick McKnight told me. In the original experiment, students took a test and were asked to guess their score. Therefore, each student had two data points: the score they thought they got (self-assessment) and the score they actually got (performance). In order to visualize these results, Dunning and Kruger separated everybody into quartiles: those who performed in the bottom 25%, those who scored in the top 25%, and the two quartiles in the middle. For each quartile, the average performance score and the average self-assessed score was plotted. This resulted in the famous Dunning-Kruger graph.</p>

<p><img height="627" width="725" src="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/files/oss/figure_1_3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Plotted this way, it looks like those in the bottom 25% thought they did much better than they did, and those in the top 25% underestimated their performance. This observation was thought to be due to the human brain: the unskilled are unaware of it. But if we remove the human brain from the equation, we get this:</p>

<p><img height="451" width="1086" src="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/files/oss/figure_2_1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The above Dunning-Kruger graph was created by Patrick McKnight using computer-generated results for both self-assessment and performance. The numbers were random. There was no bias in the coding that would lead these fictitious students to guess they had done really well when their actual score was very low. And yet we can see that the two lines look eerily similar to those of Dunning and Kruger’s seminal experiment. A<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690100174X"> similar simulation</a> was done by Dr. Phillip Ackerman and colleagues three years after the original Dunning-Kruger paper, and the results were similar.</p>

<p>Measuring someone’s perception of anything, including their own skills, is fraught with difficulties. How well I think I did on my test today could change if the whole thing was done tomorrow, when my mood might differ and my self-confidence may waver. This measurement of self-assessment is thus, to a degree, unreliable. This unreliability--sometimes massive, sometimes not--means that any true psychological effect that does exist will be measured as smaller in the context of an experiment. This is called attenuation due to unreliability. “Scores of books, articles, and chapters highlight the problem with measurement error and attenuated effects,” Patrick McKnight wrote to me. In his simulation with random measurements, the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect actually becomes <i>more</i> visible as the measurement error increases. “We have no instance in the history of scientific discovery,” he continued, “where a finding improves by increasing measurement error. None.”</p>

<h5><b>Breaking the spell</b></h5>

<p>When I plug “Dunning-Kruger effect” into Google News, I get over 8,500 hits from media outlets like <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and the CBC. So many simply endorse the effect as a real bias of the brain, so it’s no wonder that people are not aware of the academic criticism that has existed since the effect was first published. It’s not just Dr. Nuhfer and his <i>Numeracy </i>papers. Other academic critics have pointed the finger, for example, at regression to the mean.</p>

<p>But as Patrick McKnight points out, regression to the mean occurs when the same measure is taken over time and we track its evolution. If I take my temperature every morning and one day spike a fever, that same measure will (hopefully) go down the next day and return to its mean value as my fever abates. That’s regression to the mean. But in the context of the Dunning-Kruger effect, nothing is measured over time, and self-assessment and performance are different measures entirely, so regression to the mean should not apply. The unreliability of the self-assessment …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><h2>Self-tracking is an investment.</h2><p>Every day since April 2017, I spend a couple of minutes before I go to sleep to log the day's activities. </p><p>Until today, I haven't really thought of the time that it takes to do this. Some back of the napkin math brings that time spent (at 5 minutes a day) to 6675 minutes, which is 11.25 hours, or <strong>4.64 whole days</strong> of me looking at a screen and doing manual data entry.</p><p>That's <em>absolutely insane</em>, you could do so much else with that amount of time! Why would someone choose to spend their precious time in that fashion?</p><p>I'll tell you why I do it, and why I don't see myself stopping this evening ritual anytime soon.</p><h2>How I began quantifying my life</h2><p>It started out with trying to build a good habit, meditation in particular. I wanted to make sure that I met my goals, and it's like they say - you can't improve what you don't track.</p><p>So like any good data nerd, I started a spreadsheet. That spreadsheet contained a cell for every day where I would indicate if I meditated or not.</p><p>Pretty simple, right?</p><p>Maybe for the first couple of weeks. What started out as an innocent little spreadsheet eventually turned into something that had 80 columns, all kinds of values (numbers, letters, time durations), formula calculations, and yes even <em>conditional formatting</em>. If you looked over my shoulder and saw it you'd probably think I was some sort of genius hedge fund guy making millions in the stock market. Nope, making zero money, and if you subscribe to the idea that time is money, making negative money in fact.</p><p><span>

<em>What my spreadsheet looked like at some point (before I stepped up my tech game)</em></p><h2>The aspects of my life that I keep track of</h2><h3>Fitness, Diet, Sleep</h3><p>The basic things to track, and I do it for obvious reasons like seeing my progress towards fitness goals and making sure that I'm not telling lies when my mom asks if I've been eating my veggies. </p><p>Health data is a big focus of the quantified self community (the online society of folks that track, share, and analyze their personal data), but even if you've never heard the term "Quantified Self" you're probably automatically tracking some sort of health data if you have a modern cell phone or electronic watch.</p><h3>Good habits &amp; things I want to learn</h3><p>Anything I want to improve on actively, I try to keep track of. I find that I get motivated by streaks and especially if it's a new habit, I'm more likely to keep it going when I visually see the momentum I have.</p><p>When I'm trying to get better at something new, I track it. It's been interesting to see the habits that stick around, and those that fizzle out. Sadly, my meditation practice that started this all isn't doing so well these days. Ironically though, I've found that the actual process of self-tracking has been a meditation of sorts, and a time for me to check in with myself.</p><h3>Bad habits</h3><p>Most people just celebrate good habits and try to brush their bad ones under the rug. I've found that tracking bad habits can be eye-opening, insightful, and opens the door to changing those habits if you wish to.</p><p>Like most people my age, "I don't have a drinking problem, but I could probably drink less". Sound familiar?</p><p>Humans are really bad at estimating, and most life decisions more than a day old are bundled up into the past and forgotten. It's one thing to know that you could drink less, and a completely other one to know exactly how many drinks you had this week, how that affects your sleep, mood, productivity and all of the other positive ambitions you have for your life.</p><p>There's also the reverse effect of the good habit streak. When you see that you've drank the past 2 nights, you're more likely to be a bit more conscious of taking today off from the sauce.</p><p><strong>Your memory will lie to you, but your data won't.</strong></p><h3>Time spend</h3><p>Time is the most precious resource, so it makes sense to keep track of it. Not that we need to be productive for every second of every day, but it does help to have a general idea of what you're spending your time on, and how that affects the other parts of your life that you care about.</p><p>I'm always working on a couple of different projects at the same time, and think of my time as an investment as there's always something else I could be doing. It helps to be able to zoom out and really see how I'm choosing to spend my time and compare that with what I'm getting out of it. I also find it fascinating to see the impact of what I'm working on and my mood, sleep, diet, and overall life choices.</p><p>Another time-related thing I track is who I spend my time with. Nothing too precise, just if I see a particular friend that day or not. This one is more just for curiosity (both myself and my friends), they always get a kick out of seeing the correlations between the days that we hang out and the rest of my tracked metrics.</p><h3>How I feel</h3><p>This one's big, as how we feel about ourselves is often times the key driver behind our life choices and day to day actions.</p><p>Call me crazy, but I want to be happy. I want to start my day in a good mood, and even more, I want to end my day in a good mood. I want to feel worry-free, confident, kind, decisive, and humble.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was born the old fashioned way and not in some sort of human positivity lab. I don't get to feel those things every single day. That's fine, I've accepted the human condition.</p><p>However, the daily actions I take do impact my mood (and the reverse is also true), and I'd like to be in touch with that. So I keep track of both, and every once in a while look at the relationships. I want to be able to answer questions like "What can I do to feel less anxious today?" or "Will eating this ice cream actually make me happy?"</p><p>These tracked metrics I keep close to myself, and the insights I get from them are my gold bars in the bank for a future rainy day.</p><h2>Datapoints tracked over time</h2><h2>So why bother doing all of this?</h2><p>The million dollar question, and the answer has evolved over time. To sum it up though:</p><ul><li><strong>Goals</strong> - Keeping myself accountable and reinforcing good habits</li><li><strong>Awareness</strong> - Not hiding from my bad habits, but acknowledging them in order to make decisions with data when it makes sense</li><li><strong>Mindfulness</strong> - This daily check-in lets me reflect on the day and set goals for tomorrow</li><li><strong>Insights</strong> - What starts as a one-way street of putting data in, turns into a two-way highway that gives me information about my life that goes beyond the obvious and has the potential to even surprise me</li><li><strong>I can't stop...</strong> - A joke but also not really. Is there a name for this type of addiction?</li></ul><h2>Is it worth it?</h2><p>I can only speak for myself, but I'd say absolutely. Those 5 minutes every night are not only not a "waste" because I reap the benefits of the data at some future point in time, but the forced moment of self-reflection is one that can be quite valuable.</p><p><em>The human lifespan is an adventure that can't simply be reduced to numbers, but I've found that using quantified self data about the day to day can enrich your life experience, answer interesting questions, and provide confidence in the actions that are taken every day.</em></p><p>What I will say though is that it doesn't need to be this extreme. For those interested in quantifying certain aspects of their life, it's easy to start small &amp; focused to help yourself with your goals. I'll warn you though, it can be addictive. </p><h2>The Quantified Self movement</h2><p>This concept of self-tracking is not one that I made up. There is a set of <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/">awesome</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/">online</a> <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/">communities</a> of people who quantify aspects of their life in different ways, and share their methods, reasons, conclusions, and insights with others.</p><p>However robust those communities are though, I think that QS is only getting started. Every year more and more wearables, devices, applications, and services that track personal data are coming out for a variety of use cases (health, wellness, financial, and medical are just the initial ones). This data needs to be handled in an ethical manner and with the upmost respect for what it stands for, in order for humans to fully trust &amp; adopt this technology. But if that can happen, our day to day data can be used for some incredible applications to really enhance the human experience.</p><h2>What I learned about myself</h2><p>Thanks for getting this far, but I think it's time for a break. In my next post I'll share the top insights that I've learned about myself from tracking all of this data every day.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post and want to get notified of the next one, feel free to <a href="https://dailyvis.com/subscribe/">subscribe</a></p></section></div>]]>

<p>
In 2016, Sam Saccone <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/319816">discovered a vulnerability</a> that
allows adversaries to run arbitrary scripts when installing an NPM package of
theirs. As mitigation, NPM co-founder Laurie Voss <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141702881055/package-install-scripts-vulnerability">
suggests</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Option 1</b>: adding <code>--ignore-scripts</code> when running <code><span>npm</span>
install</code>
</li>
<li>
<b>Option 2</b>: permanently adding <code>ignore-scripts=true</code> to <code>.npmrc</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
UI Drafter uses the latter because it avoids having to
remember the flag everytime. But that option disables NPM
<code>"scripts"</code>. Therefore, we end up with two alternatives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Option A</b>: overriding: <code><span>npm</span> run --ignore-scripts=false
<b>test</b></code>
</li>
<li>
<b>Option B</b>: using this shell script or a <a href="#-Makefile">Makefile</a>:
</li>
</ul>
<pre><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>case</span> <span>$1</span> <span>in</span>
  <b>dev</b>)   ./make-dev.js <span>;;</span>
  <b>test</b>)  mocha <span>"src/**/*.test.js"</span><span></span> <span>;;</span>
  <b>lint</b>)  eslint src <span>;;</span>
  <b>slint</b>) stylelint <span>"src/**/*.css"</span><span></span> <span>;;</span>

  <b>prod</b>)  <span>time</span> ./make-production.js <span>;;</span>
  <b>all</b>)   <span>$0</span> <b>test</b> &amp;&amp; <span>$0</span> <b>lint</b> &amp;&amp; <span>$0</span> <b>slint</b> &amp;&amp; <span>$0</span> <b>prod</b> <span>;;</span>

  *)     <span>echo</span> <span>"Invalid task: <span>$1</span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>exit</span> <span>1</span> <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</pre>
<p>Which can be ran as:</p>
<pre>./<span>make</span> <b>test</b>
</pre>
<p>
If the package is not globally installed, prefix the path. For example:
</p>
<pre><b>lint</b>) <span>node_modules/.bin/</span>eslint src <span>;;</span>
</pre>
<h3>Overriding at installation</h3>
<p>
If you need to install packages that install binary dependencies, or rely
on running an NPM script, override the <code>.npmrc</code>:
</p>
<pre><span>npm</span> install <span>--ignore-scripts=false</span> <i>package-name</i>
</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><p>Pinterest is an extraordinarily powerful tool for consumers, but is still misunderstood by marketers. I worked at Pinterest for 2 years helping build their core content understanding technology, and learned a lot about what makes for a successful Pinterest marketing strategy. I hope this guide helps demystify how marketers can get the most from Pinterest as a marketing channel. </p><p>If you have any questions, please <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hey%20@jmilinovich">Tweet @jmilinovich</a>! </p><ol><li><a href="#Why-is-Pinterest-marketing-important">Why is Pinterest marketing important?</a></li><li><a href="#How-does-Pinterest-marketing-work">How does Pinterest marketing work?</a></li><li><a href="#How-to-create-a-Pinterest-marketing-plan">How to create a Pinterest marketing plan?</a></li><li><a href="#How-to-make-Pinterest-pins">How to make Pinterest pins?</a></li><li><a href="#How-to-make-Pinterest-Pins-popular">How to make Pinterest Pins popular?</a></li><li><a href="#Conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ol><h2>Pinterest as a distribution channel</h2><p>Pinterest is a powerful tool that helps people all over the world discover ideas for things to do in their lives. Whether it’s finding recipes, figuring out what to wear, finding new beauty tips or literally any other use case imaginable… people are doing it on Pinterest.</p><p>While search engines like Google focus on the bottom of the purchase funnel (ie, once someone knows that they have a need and are actively looking for it) and social networks like Facebook and Instagram focus on the top of the funnel (ie, when customers are passively looking to consume content with no intent), Pinterest is the only place on the internet that lets marketers reach consumer in the consideration phase. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2514c6be4877df4b7599580c5af4d1c3c2f54f86/453eb/img/posts/pinterest-guide/consideration.png" alt="The marketing consideration funnel"></p><p>This creates a big opportunity for businesses to get their products, goods and services in front of potential buyers while they’re deciding what they want to buy, but haven’t made the decision yet. That’s one of the most powerful things about Pinterest- people go there to find ideas, not just to make purchasing decisions. This means that marketers are able to reach consumers before they’ve made up their mind on what they’re looking to do.</p><h2>Pinterest as a source of inbound links</h2><p>While the most clear first-order effect to a strong Pinterest presence is creating a powerful new referral traffic source, there’s also a misunderstood but very powerful second-order effect: creating more inbound links to your website. </p><p>Have you noticed how no matter what you search for, it seems that you almost always see Pinterest results on the first page of Google? Pinterest’s core growth strategy has been about getting excellent at SEO, or search engine optimization. Practically speaking this means that the company has spent a lot of effort creating millions of high quality landing pages with the explicit purpose of being indexed by Google. Each of these landing pages shows dozens of Pins, and each contains a link to that Pin’s page on Pinterest. </p><p>As your content becomes more popular, it will begin showing up on more of Pinterest’s SEO pages, which means that it will be more readily indexed by Google. Since Google gives Pinterest’s domain a high authority and quality score, this means that over time you will start to accumulate some of this authority if your Pins are shown in prominent places. So, getting good at Pinterest doesn’t just help improve your Pinterest referral traffic, it can also improve your traffic from places like Google! </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bbc3082cbd708936207fcc8fed30415b5077ee03/32add/img/posts/pinterest-guide/pinterest-results.png" alt="Example of Pinterest landing pages"></p><h2>Pinterest is a search engine</h2><p>The most important thing to understand about Pinterest is that at its core it’s a search engine, not a social network.  People don’t use Pinterest to “follow” specific brands but rather to follow interests and search for ideas. A “Pin” is simply a visual bookmark to a webpage, and under the hood Pinterest’s technology stack is focused on figuring out what interests a Pin is about, and which users are interested in which interests. Content on Pinterest isn’t temporal like other social networks, but evergreen like on Google.</p><h2>Help Pinterest understand your content</h2><p>This means that the most important thing to get right for Pinterest marketing is helping Pinterest understand what interests your Pins are about. This means that the key underlying concept for Pinterest marketing is to create Pins for all of your web content, and then make sure that Pinterest has a clear understanding of what interests they align to. </p><p>Once Pinterest understands what a given Pin is about, it can start showing it to users to see how they interact with it. If they engage with it (ie, Save it to one of their boards or Click on it to see the underlying content), Pinterest uses this as a positive sign that this is quality content and will begin showing it to more people. </p><p>As such, one of the most important things to get right is having a clear strategy for how to communicate to Pinterest what your Pins are about and getting engagement signals on the Pins early. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/db6e047a9650880cd7f0be4c4718c0791790c2e0/18ef8/img/posts/pinterest-guide/pinterest-interests.png" alt="Example of Pinterest interests"></p><h2>Choose your Interests</h2><p>The most critical thing to get right in your Pinterest marketing plan is determining what Interests are most important to your business. There are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HxL-0Z3p2fgxis9YBP2HWC3tvPrs1hAuHDRtH-NJTIM/edit#gid=118370875">over 10,000 interests on Pinterest today</a>, ranging from highly broad to highly specific. Start by brainstorming what interests your target audience has today, as well as what interests your content is actually about. Look for the overlap of these two sets and choose the 10-15 that have the most promise to focus in on first. </p><h2>Create your Boards</h2><p>Once you’ve chosen the interests that you want to focus on, the next step is to decide on the architecture of your Pinterest for Business account. Pinterest accounts for users and businesses alike are defined by the boards that they create and post Pins to. You can think of a board as a folder of visual bookmarks that are public by default. When someone looks at your Pinterest account, the fastest way that they will understand what you’re about is by the names of the boards that you create. </p><p>Start by creating boards whose names are the same as the 10-15 interests you chose to focus on. It’s OK if they have more words in them as well, but make sure that the Interest name itself is very prominent. Make sure that each board has a very specific description that explains the core ideas that you’ll be pinning to the board.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dadf2e2890dde22bbff64a7ded8e0dcf6b592fe9/31afa/img/posts/pinterest-guide/boards.png" alt="Example of Pinterest boards"></p><p>Next, you need to decide what content to start posting onto these boards. </p><h2>Pinning existing content</h2><p>There are only two kinds of Pins on Pinterest: Pins from your own website, and Pins from other people’s websites. Both are equally important to a strong Pinterest strategy. The first thing you should do is to fill your boards with Pins that are already on Pinterest and were created by other people. Spend some time saving 20-30 Pins to each of your boards. As you do this, Pinterest will also begin recommending new Pins in your homefeed that are related to what you’ve been Pinning. </p><p>The reason you’re seeing the Pins that Pinterest is recommending to you is because Pinterest already knows a lot about them and has a high confidence that users like you will find them interesting. When you save them to your boards, you’re giving Pinterest even more signal about what your board is about. This is extremely important, because Pinterest learns a lot about new Pins based on the other Pins that it shows up on boards with. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a3580f834d291668bd22cae46f7854ddb0106853/de8da/img/posts/pinterest-guide/existing-pin.png" alt="Example of Pinterest pins"></p><p>Each week you should also continue to save new, existing content to your boards to keep giving Pinterest more signal and context for what your Pins are about. </p><h2>Pinning your own content</h2><p>Once you create a good base of existing Pins on your boards, you can start to plan your strategy for getting your own original content into Pinterest. First, go through all of your existing website content and map out what content would be relevant for the Pinterest audience. Generally speaking, the best content will be things like blog posts or eCommerce product landing pages. You should skip things like your homepage, about page, contact us page or other informational pages that don’t provide highly specific and useful content about a specific concept. </p><p>On social networks, it’s important that you have a steady pace of posting content into your feed so that you stay top of mind and also don’t inundate followers by posting 100 things at once. Pinterest is much more like Google, however, where you want them to know about your content upfront and all at once. </p><p>You should post all of your existing, relevant content to Pinterest upfront and then consistently add new content as it’s published online. Save it to the most relevant board to give Pinterest a clear understanding of what your content’s about. You can also post it to more than one board if it’s relevant to multiple categories. </p><p>The Pins that perform best on Pinterest have been created specifically for Pinterest following their <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en-gb/content/creative-best-practices/">creative best practices</a>. Practically speaking this means that each Pin will require some editing work within a graphics editor tool. Generally speaking, each Pin can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes to create by hand if using a tool like Photoshop, Canva or Adobe Spark. This can be quite burdensome, especially if you’re trying to create dozens or hundreds of Pins for your site. </p><p><a href="https://www.aesthetic.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=pinterest-guide">Aesthetic’s software</a> is able to generate on-brand Pinterest Pins from a company’s website automatically. Simply enter a URL, and our app will create dozens of variations of graphics to promote that webpage, including several that follow Pinterest’s best practices guide. We’ve seen our users cut down the time it takes to create a Pin by 95% using our tool. </p><p>Once you’ve created your Pin graphics, you can upload them into the Pinterest system. Add the URL for each Pin along with a detailed description that touches upon what the Pins about and ideally mentions the specific interests that it’s related to. Post these to the right boards, and you’re off to the races! </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4ab1dd02738de6695f0118fd169a78c4e10d21bb/09e8b/img/posts/pinterest-guide/aesthetic-pins.png" alt="Example of Pinterest pins made with Aesthetic"></p><p>Once you’ve uploaded your content to Pinterest, you will see the impressions slowly start to trickle in as the system understands more about what your content’s about. Generally speaking it can take months for new content on Pinterest to get enough exposure for Pinterest to determine whether it’s sufficiently interesting enough for it to be promoted more widely within the system.</p><p>Another option to fast track the distribution of your Pins is to run small budget ads for your own Pins, targeting the Interests that they’re related …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

		<p>In my quest to write a fast IPv4+6 parser, I wrote a
slow-but-I-think-correct parser, to use as a base of comparison. In
doing so, I discovered more cursed IP address representations that I
was previously unaware of. Let’s explore together!</p>

<p>We start out simple, with IPv4 and IPv6 in what I’ll call their
“canonical form”: <code>192.168.0.1</code> and <code>1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8</code>. Various specs
call these “dotted quad” (more specifically, “dotted decimal”),
dot-separated fields each representing 1 byte; and “colon-hex”,
colon-separated fields each representing 2 bytes.</p>

<p>The first bits of complexity come from IPv6. In canonical form, common
addresses would end up with long runs of zeros in the middle. So, <code>::</code>
allows you to elide 1 or more 16-bit blocks of zeros: <code>1:2::3:4</code> means
<code>1:2:0:0:0:0:3:4</code></p>

<p>Next up, for cursed historical reasons, IPv6 permits you to write the
final 32 bits of the address in dotted quad form. Effectively, you can
splat an IPv4 address onto the end of IPv6 addresses!
<code>1:2:3:4:5:6:77.77.88.88</code> means <code>1:2:3:4:5:6:4d4d:5858</code>.</p>

<p>And of course, you can combine the two! <code>fe80::1.2.3.4</code> means <code>fe80:0:0:0:0:0:102:304</code></p>

<p>The existence of <code>::</code> introduces an annoying edge case in parsing: the
<code>::</code> can be at the start or end of the address, and the “empty” side
of the address is not one of the 16-bit fields. <code>::1</code> means
<code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</code>, <code>1::</code> means <code>1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0</code>, and <code>::</code> means
<code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0</code>. This is a natural consequence of the <code>::</code> rule, but
it makes the parser slightly more annoying to write.</p>

<p>One final rule for IPv6: technically, each colon-hex field is 4 hex
digits, but you can elide leading zeros, as I’ve been doing so
far. Fully canonically, <code>::</code> is
<code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000</code>. My apologies to trypophobic
readers.</p>

<p>That’s it for IPv6, mostly. Now, on to IPv4!</p>

<p>Fun fact, the textual representation of IPv4 was never standardized in
any document before IPv6 needed a grammar for its weirdo “trailing
dotted quad” notation. So, it’s a de-facto standard that boils down to
mostly “what did 4.2BSD understand?”, and “what did other OSes keep
when they copied 4.2BSD?”</p>

<p>And hoo boy, strap yourselves in, because 4.2BSD sure had some whacky
opinions! Let’s use <code>192.168.140.255</code> as an example. That’s an IPv4
address that people would look at and go “yes, that sure is an IPv4
address.” How else can we write that exact same address?</p>

<p>This is the same IP address: <code>3232271615</code>. You get that by
interpreting the 4 bytes of the IP address as a big-endian unsigned
32-bit integer, and print that. This leads to a classic parlor trick:
if you try to visit <a href="http://192.168.140.255/">http://3232271615</a> , Chrome will load
<a href="http://192.168.140.255/">http://192.168.140.255</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, but that’s sort-of sensible, right? An IPv4 address is 4 bytes,
so printing it as a single number is a bit human-unfriendly, but
broadly plausible, right?</p>

<p>How about <code>0300.0250.0214.0377</code> ? That’s still the same
address. Dotted quad, except each field is written out in octal.</p>

<p>And if octal is supported, you might be wondering about hex. And you’d
be right! <code>192.168.140.255</code> is also <code>0xc0.0xa8.0x8c.0xff</code>, according
to 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>Now, remember before we had CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) ?
IPv4 addresses were Class A, Class B or Class C. It was a weird time.</p>

<p>And that weird time made it into IP addresses! The familiar
<code>192.168.140.255</code> notation is technically the “Class C” notation. You
can also write that address in “class B” notation as <code>192.168.36095</code>,
or in “Class A” notation as <code>192.11046143</code>. What we’re doing is
coalescing the final bytes of the address into either a 16-bit or a
24-bit integer field.</p>

<p>This, by the way, is why utilities like <code>ping</code> will accept weird
looking addresses like <code>127.1</code> for <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Unlike IPv6, it’s not
doing some kind of “missing fields are zero” expansion. <code>127.1</code> is the
Class A notation for “host 1 of network 127”, where the 1 is a 24-bit
number.</p>

<p>And finally, we come to one last bit of unspecified behavior: do IPv4
addresses permit an unlimited number of leading zeros in each quad? Or
is there a maximum of 3 digits? <code>001.002.003.004</code> is universally
recognized as valid. What about
<code>0000000001.0000000002.0000000003.000000004</code>?</p>

<p>You might also be wondering if either of these numbers should be read
in as octal, since we said earlier that a leading zero might be
interpreted as octal. It depends! There are implementations that do
both, but <em>most</em> modern implementations have abandoned the octal and
hex notation, and treat leading 0s as decimal.</p>

<p>The leading zero debate also infects IPv6, to some extent. Is
<code>000001::00001.00002.00003.00004</code> is a valid IPv6 address (“common”
form <code>1::1.2.3.4</code>, or <code>1::102:304</code>)? Most modern parsers seem to allow
an unlimited amount of leading zeros in their representations,
probably because they’re leaning on some “parse integer” library that
implements that behavior.</p>

<p>And so, we reach the bitter end. If you want to <em>truly</em> parse IP
addresses, this is the bullshit you have to put up with.</p>

<p>Currently, my slow reference parser jettisons a lot of old baggage,
and sticks to what I think is a sensible subset of these
possibilities. It understands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classic v4 dotted decimal, with any number of leading zeros.</li>
<li>It does not process Class A/B notation, or hex or octal notation.</li>
<li>It does not process the “uint32 to the knee” representation.</li>
<li>For IPv6, it understands canonical colon-hex form, as well as ::
and trailing-IPv4 style (where the trailing IPv4 follows the same
rules as the previous tweet). Each field is allowed any number of
leading zeros.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m on the fence about that last one, the “IPv6 with an embedded
dotted decimal” form. My reference parser (Go’s <code>net.ParseIP</code>)
understands it, but it’s not really that useful any more in the real
world. At the dawn of IPv6, the idea was that you could upgrade an
address to IPv6 by prepending a pair of colons, as in <code>::1.2.3.4</code>, but
modern transition mechanisms no longer offer anything as clear-cut as
this, so the notation doesn’t really show up in the wild.</p>

	<p>
Numbers. Numbers are easy. All you need to know to sort them out is that
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
if 1 ≤ 2 and 2 ≤ 3 then 1 ≤ 3;
	</li>
	<li>
either 4 ≤ 5 or 5 ≤ 4...
	</li>
	<li>
...or both, but if 6 ≤ 6 and 6 ≤ 6 then 6 = 6.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Oh, shit! I forgot to put a smart face on. Let's start over.
	</p>
	<p>
A <b><span id="index_total_order">total order</span></b>, also known as <b><span id="index_linear_order">linear order</span></b> is a relation “≤” on a set <span>S</span>. For <span>a, b, c ∈ S</span>, the three properties hold.
	</p>
	<p>
The first one is called <b><span id="index_transitivity">transitivity</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c ⇒ a ≤ c.
	</p>
	<p>
The second one is <b><span id="index_connexity">connexity</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a
	</p>
	<p>
And the third one is <b><span id="index_antisymmetry">antisymmetry</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a ⇒ a = b
	</p>
	<p>
With rules established for <span>≤</span>, we can also tell either <span>a &lt; b</span> or <span>a &gt; b</span> or <span>a = b</span> for every <span>a</span> and <span>b</span>.
	</p>
	
	
<br>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Predicate</th><th>Result</th></tr>
<tr><td>a = b</td>		<td id="e"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &lt; b</td>	<td id="l"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &gt; b</td>	<td id="g"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≠ b</td>	<td id="ne"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≤ b</td>	<td id="le"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≥ b</td>	<td id="ge"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
	<p>
Real numbers are comparable. That implies that you can sort them. Of course, not only numbers are comparable. Names are comparable and sortable in alphabetical order. Skyscrapers are comparable and sortable by height. A lot of things are comparable and sortable.
	</p>
	<p>
But a few things aren't. Like the <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/yet_another_alternative_to_floating_point_numbers.html">intervals, we use to represent numbers with errors</a>. We use them when we don't know the exact number <span>x</span> but we know its error <span>ε</span> and therefore have all the reasons to believe that it's jammed somewhere between <span>x<sub>1</sub></span> and <span>x<sub>2</sub></span> where
	</p>
	<p>
x<sub>1</sub> = x − ε
<br>
x<sub>2</sub> = x + ε
	</p>
	<p>
These intervals are helpful when we want to measure a computational error of some calculation or to see if some algorithm is stable enough. They aren't comparable or truly sortable though.
	</p>
	<p>
Consider two overlapping intervals. Let's say, <span>[3, 6]</span> and <span>[5, 8]</span>. We know that the fist interval actually means a number between  <span>3</span> and  <span>6</span>. The second — another number between <span>5</span> and <span>8</span>. Intuitively, the latter should be greater than the former. But what if it is  <span>5</span> and the former is  <span>6</span>? Then it's obviously less. There is a chance they are even equal. 
	</p>
	<p>
So there is some kind of order, for instance, <span>[6, 8]</span> is definitely greater than  <span>[3, 5]</span>. But this order doesn't hold for every possible pair of intervals.
	</p>
	<p>
This makes things unpleasant. For the very least, we can't now use binary logic since all the comparisons now return three states. E. g. <span>a ≤ b</span> can now be <span>true</span>, <span>false</span> or <span>none of the above</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
Consequently, this means the conventional <span>if... else</span> statement now has to be redesigned. And all the algorithms that use it.
	</p>
	<p>
We wouldn't have to give up binary logic completely if we agree to “split” the semantics of the predicates into two. For every predicate on the two intervals, we can still say whether the numbers they represent definitely suffice the predicate, or whether they possibly do so.
	</p>
	<p>
For instance, <span>[3, 5]</span> is definitely less than <span>[6, 8]</span>, and <span>[3, 6]</span> is possibly less than <span>[5, 8]</span>. The most unpleasant case for us is when intervals overlap. Everything is indefinite, and everything is possible then.
	</p>
<br>
	
	
<br>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Predicate</th><th>Deffinitely</th><th>Possibly</th></tr>
<tr><td>a = b</td>		<td id="de"></td>		<td id="pe"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &lt; b</td>	<td id="dl"></td>		<td id="pl"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &gt; b</td>	<td id="dg"></td>		<td id="pg"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≠ b</td>	<td id="dne"></td>	<td id="pne"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≤ b</td>	<td id="dle"></td>	<td id="ple"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≥ b</td>	<td id="dge"></td>	<td id="pge"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

	<p>
Still, every <span>if... else</span> works. Within its semantics that is. However, the algebra behind the logic isn't yet Boolean. Now <span>¬ (a &lt; b) ≢ a ≥ b</span>. Computational algorithms may be technically built using the same building blocks as if the intervals were numbers but that's it.
	</p>

	<p>
Speaking of building stuff. Let's talk about programming. Programming non-Boolean interval logic in C++ or Python is fairly easy. You have to reimplement every predicate for the interval type — and you're golden!
	</p>
	<pre id="code_1">struct Interval {
    Number lb; // lower bound
    Number ub; // upper bound
}

// Interval-specific predicates.
bool coincide(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return l.lb == r.lb &amp;&amp; l.ub == r.ub;
}

bool intersect(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return (l.ub &gt;= r.lb &amp;&amp; l.lb &lt;= r.ub)
        || (r.ub &gt;= l.lb &amp;&amp; r.lb &lt;= l.ub);
}

// The "definite" interval logic.
// The relation should keep for every number in l and in r.
bool operator==(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return l.lb == l.ub &amp;&amp; coincide(l, r);
}

bool operator&lt;(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return l.ub &lt; r.lb;
}

bool operator&gt;(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return r &lt; l;
}

bool operator&lt;=(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return l.lb &lt; r.ub &amp;&amp; l.ub == r.lb;
}

bool operator&gt;=(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return r &lt;= l;
}

bool operator!=(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return r &lt; l || l &lt; r;
}</pre>
	<p>
Nobody cares about the relationship between predicates being Boolean-ish. They are all just some arbitrary functions so with them, you can easily define either the “definite” logic or the “possible” one. You can have both if you define them for different but interchangeable types. It's all a little verbose but doable.
	</p>
	<p>
It gets a little bit more tricky in Rust which relies on the notion of order pretty much.
	</p>
	<p>
The comparison operators for a custom type are usually introduced using an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html">std::cmp::Ord</a> trait. It requires that:
	</p>
	<p>
∀ a, b: (a &lt; b) ⊕ (a = b) ⊕ (a &gt; b)
<br>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c ⇒ a ≤ c.
	</p>
	<p>
The first reads as for every <span>a</span> and <span>b</span>, one and only one is true: either <span>(a &lt; b)</span> or <span>(a = b)</span> or <span>(a &gt; b)</span>. This doesn't work for us. When intervals intersect, in “definite” logic none of the predicates are true. And in the “possible” logic, they all are.
	</p>
	<p>
Luckily, there is another more relaxed trait that represents not total order, but <span id="index_partial_order">partial order</span>: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html">std::cmp::PartialOrd</a>. Which only requires <b><span id="index_asymmetry">asymmetry</span></b> (not even antisymmetry) and transitivity (we've seen it before):
	</p>
	<p>
a &lt; b ⇒ ¬(a &gt; b)
<br>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c ⇒ a ≤ c.
	</p>
	<p>
Аnd for the “definite” logic, this works.
	</p>
	<pre id="code_2">impl std::cmp::PartialEq for RB32{
    // the same as operator == in C++ or __eq__(self, other) in Python
    fn eq(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; bool {
        self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; self.ub == other.ub
    }
}

impl std::cmp::PartialOrd for RB32{
    // this is usually enough to replace all the rest
    fn partial_cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Option&lt;std::cmp::Ordering&gt; {
        if self.ub &lt; other.lb {
            Some(std::cmp::Ordering::Less)
        } else if self.lb &gt; other.ub {
            Some(std::cmp::Ordering::Greater)
        } else if self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; self.ub == other.ub {
            Some(std::cmp::Ordering::Equal)
        } else {
            None // this is what differentiates Ord and PartialOrd
        }
    }

    // but since in out logic, (a &lt; b) ∨ (a = b) ≢ a ≤ b,
    // we have to define ≤ and ≥ explicitly.
    fn le(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; bool {
        (self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; self.lb == self.ub) ||
        (self.ub == other.ub &amp;&amp; other.lb == other.ub)
    }
    fn ge(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; bool {
        (self.ub == other.ub &amp;&amp; self.lb == self.ub) ||
        (self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; other.lb == other.ub)
    }
}</pre>

	<p>
The code is less verbose than in C++ or Python, and it would have been even less so if we were relying on Boolean algebra. With it, you don't even have to write <span>le</span> or <span>ge</span> methods explicitly, <span>cmp</span> is enough. With Boolean algebra, Rust can deduce the rest for you.
	</p>
	<p>
Ok, but that was the “definite” logic. But what about the “possible”?
	</p>
	<p>
I'm afraid, for this particular task, Rust comes short. In the “possible” interval logic, the intersecting intervals may be <span>a &lt; b</span>, and <span>a = b</span>, and <span>a &gt; b</span>, all at the same time. Every predicate is true since everything is possible. You can't program that with Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html">Ordering</a>. However, this is not a flaw, this is a design choice.
	</p>
	<p>
Non-Boolean logics are rare, and relations more general than partial order are almost never useful. If you really really want this kind of logic, you can still implement it using functions and not operators. At the same time, you can expect that if a class implements the <span>std::cmp::Ord</span> trait, then all the sorting algorithms will work with it correctly. While in C++, a sorting algorithm will run on anything with the <span>operator&lt;</span> reloaded with no correctness guaranteed or even pinky-promised.
	</p>
	<h2>
Conclusion
	</h2>
	<p>
Non-Boolean logics are rare but not extinct. Interval logic is one example. Sometimes, you can implement a logic you want within total order or partial order but sometimes even that isn't enough and you need an even more general relation. With operator overloading, you have the freedom to go there but you also have less assurance when working within the total order.
	</p>

The paintings on the counter include two mallard ducks, and indeed a fragment of duck bone was in fact found inside one of the containers, alongside swine, goats, fish and land snails, indicating the great variety of products of animal origin used in the preparation of the dishes.</p><p>On the other hand, the first archaeobotanical analyses have allowed us to identify fragments of deciduous oak, which probably belonged to structural elements of the counter. At the bottom of a&nbsp;<em>dolium</em>&nbsp;– which has been identified as a container for wine on the basis of the bottle for drawing the liquid that was found inside it – the presence of beans was detected, which had been intentionally broken apart or ground. In his&nbsp;<em>De re Coquinaria&nbsp;</em>(I,5), Apicius explains the reason for this, asserting that they were used in order to modify the taste and colour of the wine, bleaching it.</p></div><p>The complete skeleton of a dog was found in the corner between the two doors of the&nbsp;<em>Thermopolium&nbsp;</em>(in the northwestern corner of the room). It was not a large and muscular dog like the one depicted on the counter, but an extremely small specimen, about 20-25cm high at the shoulder despite being an adult dog. Although quite rare, dogs of such small size indicate that intentional selection took place in the Roman age in order to obtain such a result.</p><p>Inside the room – and particularly behind the counter where they were dragged by the first excavators – a significant number of human bones were found, belonging to a mature-senescent individual, of at least 50 years of age. An initial analysis made it possible to link these dispersed bones with what remained of an individual who was discovered in the innermost corner of the shop, and who, at the time the pyroclastic current arrived, was most likely on top of some kind of bed, as evidenced by the space set aside for storing the bed, and a series of nails and wood residues found under the body.</p><p>The bones belonging to at least one other individual, which were discovered inside a large&nbsp;<em>dolium</em>, and were probably positioned in this way by the first excavators, are still to be investigated.</p><p>This is merely the initial macroscopic data yielded by the ongoing excavation, but it will surely not be the last. Indeed, the finds collected and brought to the laboratory will be analysed further, through specific studies in departments and universities with whom we have an agreement, which will allow us to further refine the data at our disposal, and therefore also our knowledge of the&nbsp;<em>Thermopolium&nbsp;</em>and the site.</p><p><a href="http://pompeiisites.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOURCE</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><section><div><article><div><p>When I created this blog back in September my goal was to post at least once
a month. It's December now and you're reading my second post, so I'm not exactly
off to a great start. 🤔</p><p>Things have been busy on the Rust BPF front though! At the end of October I
began working on a blog about the current state of things, exactly one year
after I started getting involved. While doing that I finally started feeling
inspired enough to try and add a BPF target to rustc, something that had been
on my todo list for a very long time but never managed to find the time to work
on.  (<em>Aah... if only someone wanted to sponsor all this work... wink wink!</em>)</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I finally sent a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79608">pull request</a>
to get the new target(s) merged. The changes were pretty straightforward, with the
only unexpected thing being that I ended up having to write
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker">https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker</a> - a partial linker needed to enable
rustc to output BPF bytecode.</p><p>I'm going to tell you why I had to write the linker in a moment, but first,
let's start with looking at how clang - the de facto standard BPF compiler -
compiles C code to BPF.</p><h2>How BPF projects are compiled with clang</h2><p>BPF doesn't have things like shared libraries and executables. Programs are
compiled as object files, then at run-time they're relocated and loaded in the
kernel where they get JIT-ted and executed.</p><p>Because of that, and because for a long time function calls were not allowed so
everything had to be inlined, BPF programs written in C are typically compiled
as a <strong>single compilation unit</strong>, with library code written in <a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/tree/master/bpf/lib">header
files</a> and included with
<code>#include</code> directives.</p><p><img alt="clang BPF compilation model" src="https://confused.ai/static/bpf-linker-clang.svg"></p><p>This compilation model is simple and effective: <strong>one compilation unit</strong> goes
in, <strong>one object file</strong> comes out. Because BPF programs tend to be small,
recompiling the whole source code on every change is generally not an issue.
Since everything gets compiled together, there's <strong>no need for linking</strong>
separate compilation artifacts. <em>(You see where this is going?)</em></p><h2>How Rust projects are compiled</h2><p>Rust uses a different compilation model. Code is split into crates. Crates
can't be lumped together with <code>#include</code> directives, they are always compiled
independently as <strong>one or more compilation units</strong>.</p><p>Consider the following example:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo tree
</span>app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->└── dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo build
<!-- -->   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
</code></pre><p><code>app</code> is an application crate that depends on a library <code>dep</code>. When building,
the following happens:</p><p><img alt="Rust compilation model" src="https://confused.ai/static/bpf-linker-rustc.svg"></p><p>The rust compiler is invoked twice: first to compile the <code>dep</code> crate as a rust
library, then to compile the <code>app</code> crate as an executable. When the <code>app</code> crate
is compiled, the <strong>pre-compiled</strong> <code>dep</code> crate is provided as input to the
compiler via the <code>--extern</code> option.</p><p>This compilation model always produces <strong>multiple object files</strong>, which then
must be <strong>linked</strong> together to produce the final output. The rust compiler uses an
internal linker abstraction, whose implementations spawn to external linkers
like <code>ld</code>, <code>lld</code>, <code>link.exe</code> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-flavor">others</a>.</p><p>Therefore, to add a new target with this model we need a linker for the target.
Since clang never links anything when targeting BPF though, it turns out that <code>lld</code> -
the LLVM linker - can't link BPF at all. So I wrote a new linker.</p><h2>A new (partial) BPF linker</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker">bpf-linker</a> takes LLVM bitcode as
input, optionally applies target-specific optimizations, and outputs a single
BPF object file. The inputs can be bitcode files (<code>.bc</code>), object files
with embedded bitcode (eg <code>.o</code> files produced compiling with
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#embed-bitcode">-C embed-bitcode=yes</a>),
or archive files (<code>.a</code> or <code>.rlib</code>).</p><p>The linker works with anything that can output LLVM bitcode, including clang.
There are a couple of reasons for taking bitcode as input instead of object
files.</p><p>Only a subset of Rust (just like only a subset of C) can be compiled to BPF
bytecode. Therefore bpf-linker tries to push code generation as late as
possible in the compilation process, after link-time optimizations have been
applied and dead code has been eliminated. This avoids hitting potential
failures generating bytecode for unsupported Rust code that is actually
unused (eg, parts of the <code>core</code> crate that are never used in a BPF context).</p><p>Another reason is that the linker might need to apply extra optimizations like
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker/blob/d890b113ffe612dcba51cc7d23a14fabd8198318/src/bin/bpf-linker.rs#L104">--unroll-loops</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker/blob/d890b113ffe612dcba51cc7d23a14fabd8198318/src/bin/bpf-linker.rs#L108">--ignore-inline-never</a>
when targeting older kernel versions that don't support loops and calls.</p><h2>Not one but two BPF targets!</h2><p>The rustc fork at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/rust/tree/bpf">https://github.com/alessandrod/rust/tree/bpf</a> includes two new
targets, <code>bpfel-unknown-none</code> and <code>bpfeb-unknown-none</code> which generate little
endian and big endian BPF respectively. The targets automatically invoke
bpf-linker so with that fork, compiling a BPF project with Rust is finally as
easy as:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo build --target=bpfel-unknown-none
</span>   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.98s
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ file target/bpfel-unknown-none/debug/app
<!-- -->target/bpfel-unknown-none/debug/app: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
</code></pre><p>Getting the targets merged will probably take a while, but worry not! With a
little trick, you can use the linker to <em>compile BPF code with stable Rust
already today!</em></p><p>I made bpf-linker implement a <code>wasm-ld</code> compatible command line. Since rustc
already knows how to invoke <code>wasm-ld</code> when targeting webassembly, it can be
made to use <code>bpf-linker</code> with the following options:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo rustc -- \
</span>        -C linker-flavor=wasm-ld \
<!-- -->        -C linker=bpf-linker \
<!-- -->        -C linker-plugin-lto 
<!-- -->   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.68s
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ file target/debug/app
<!-- -->target/debug/app: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
</code></pre><p>Let's see what those options do:</p><ul><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-flavor">-C linker-flavor=wasm-ld</a>
tells the compiler that the linker supports the same command line options as <code>wasm-ld</code></li><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker">-C linker=bpf-linker</a>
configures bpf-linker as the linker to spawn</li><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html#linker-plugin-lto">-C linker-plugin-lto</a>
tells rustc to pass LLVM bitcode to the linker</li></ul><p>And voilà! Go compile some BPF with stable rust now 🎉</p><h2>What's next</h2><p>bpf-linker is obviously new and needs more testing. Over the next few weeks I'm
going to add more unit tests and try it on more Rust code. I'm also thinking of
trying to link the whole Cilium BPF code with it just to test with a large,
complex code base.</p><p>While working on the rustc target, at some point I went off on a bit of a
tangent and ended up making some changes to LLVM and the kernel so I'm going to
try and finish those off. They are needed to implement the
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-trap-intrinsic">llvm.trap</a> intrinsic
so <code>panic!()</code> can be implemented in a generic way, instead of having to resort
to program-specific hacks like jumping to an empty program with
<code>bpf_tail_call()</code>. I'll probably do a whole separate post about that.</p><p>Finally, after my <a href="https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes">last post</a> I
received some truly great feedback! I was especially pleased to hear from a
couple of companies that are using BPF and that are considering using it with
Rust.</p><p>I was equally pleased to see that there's a group of people developing BPF in C
that feel strongly that I'm wasting my time and that Rust brings nothing over
C, being BPF statically verified, not needing the borrow checker etc.  They gave
me inspiration for a post I'm hoping to publish soon, which will cover why I
think that Rust has the potential to become as central to the BPF ecosystem as it
is central to WebAssembly development today. Until next time!</p></div></article></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>With the industry-wide transition to smart TVs many of us have felt like there is no option but to get one. And the walls are closing in — it seems like almost every TV sold today is a smart one, which means a lack of control of what’s happening on our device, the possibility of the company deciding one day to show us ads (as Samsung as done), and the certainty that our viewing and usage data is being sent off to all sorts of third parties. </p>



<p>The solution? Buy a dumb TV!</p>



<h2><span id="What_Is_A_Dumb_TV">What Is A Dumb TV?</span></h2>



<p>The alternative to Smart TVs are, of course, non-smart TVs or, as people have taken to calling them, dumb TVs. These are televisions without an internet connection, without built-in HBO Max or Disney, without Amazon Alexa, and lacking apps of any kind. A dumb TV is the television equivalent of a flip phone. </p>



<p>Just because your TV is dumb doesn’t mean you can’t use Roku or Apple TV, etc. In this case you are simply opting to plug those devices into your TV via HDMI rather than having them built in. In almost all cases the plugged in device is better than having the software version built into your TV, so you are making your TV be smart instead of being forced to have one. </p>



<h2><span id="Why_Not_Buy_An_Old_TV">Why Not Buy An Old TV?</span></h2>



<p>You can definitely buy an old TV to solve this problem instead of hunting around for an increasingly rare non-smart in 2021. Televisions age pretty well, so as long as you can find something relatively high quality and made in the last 8 (or so) years you are good to go. </p>



<p>You’ll mainly need to ensure that your older model is in good physical condition, has enough HDMI ports to suit a current user, has no burn-in or wear issues, has a working remote, doesn’t have cracked or wrecked speakers, and that the color hasn’t gone crazy over time. You’ll also want to make sure your TV is an LED TV, so it’s power efficient and looks great, instead of using an outdated technology (like plasma). </p>



<p>For example, I have a Samsung dumb TV from 2012 (or so) that works perfectly well, has sufficient volume, and completely gets the job done. It was a good TV when I bought it, and it’s a great TV now, because it doesn’t have any of the features that I don’t want — and can’t avoid — today. </p>



<h2><span id="Just_Dont_Connect_It_To_the_Internet">Just Don’t Connect It To the Internet</span></h2>



<p>A smart TV can’ the smart without an internet connection so one thing you can do to get a dumb TV is to simply not connect it to your WiFi network. Your TV will will work since it’s connect through coax but the rest of the data cannot flow because the television doesn’t have an internet connection!</p>



<p>You can then go ahead and add a Nvidia Shield or Apple TV and connect that to the internet. This way the auxiliary devices will have internet connection <em>while you are using them</em>, but the TV itself (the hypervisor in this scenario) stays blissfully unaware of that internet connection. </p>



<p>Note, there have been scattered reports of some TVs, including those from Samsung, simply searching for open WiFi signals and attempting to connect to them, but this is an extreme and user-hostile example that hopefully won’t be repeated (assuming its true in the first place).</p>



<p>Some smart TV will force you to connect them to the internet for firmware updates and will resort to frequent nagging to get you to do this, but very few will force you to do it or not work entirely without the connection (yet). </p>

<p>Here are some intelligent picks in non-smart TVs. </p>

<p>Sceptre has generally been considered a mid-tier TV company, but they have done a good job of not transitioning entirely to Smart TVs. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3mZUDAp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" title="https://amzn.to/3mZUDAp" data-wpel-link="external">Sceptre U518CV-UM</a> is a 50-inch 4K that’s completely non-smart TV that is from the 2019 model year, so you are getting recent tech without the connectivity features that you don’t want.</p>

<h3><span id="Insignia_55-inch_Class_LED">Insignia 55-inch Class LED</span></h3>



<p>If you live near a Best Buy then you will have access to their house brand, Insignia. The Insignia 55-inch (NS-55D420NA20) is a LED-lit 1080p television that sells for about $300. It’s devoid of smart features but it has three HDMI ports and was first released in 2019. </p>



<p>This line of Insignia dumb TVs is sold from 19 inches up to 58 inches so there will be a TV for every room size. </p>

Commercial TV’s can get super experience for what seems like a normal TV — and for what will function like a normal TV if you are simply using it like one! The smartest feature this TV has is the ability to play images from a USB stick.</p>



<p>This TV has all the features you’d expect from a normal television, like HDMI input, and isn’t missing anything obvious. For example it still has integrated speakers and 1080p (1920×1080) resolution.</p>

<h2><span id="Dumb_TV_Alternatives">Dumb TV Alternatives</span></h2>



<p>Of course there are other ways to avoid a smart TV. Here are some bright ideas…</p>



<ul><li><strong>Projector:</strong> The smart device revolution has really come to projectors yet, so you can watch your TV and movies through a projector without having to worry about your privacy or ads</li><li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Computer monitors haven’t gotten smart (since they are connected to something smart) so if you watch television on a computer monitor you’ll have no need to worry about built-in Alexa or Google Home</li><li><strong>Business TV (aka Commercial Display):</strong> A <a href="https://www.neweggbusiness.com/s/commercial-tvs/id-3672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" title="https://www.neweggbusiness.com/s/commercial-tvs/id-3672" data-wpel-link="external">business-focused TV</a> (something you’d see hung in an office or airport and playing CNN all day on mute) is designed for simplicity and long-lasting performance. These haven’t yet gotten smart and will likely stay dumb for years as they need to have error- and update-free operation for years on end</li><li><strong>Outdoor TV:</strong> For some reason outdoor and weatherproof televisions have yet to go smart. Here is a <a href="https://amzn.to/3lMr0B0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" title="https://amzn.to/3lMr0B0" data-wpel-link="external">good example of one from Furrion</a>.</li></ul><h2><span id="FAQs">FAQs</span></h2>


<div><ol><li><strong>Can I use PiHole or a similar device to block the ads and privacy leaks from my smart TV?</strong><p>You'd think this would work, but manufacturers have gotten wise to the PiHole and other methods of blocking tracking and advertising injection so, no, you really can't. At this point many manufacturers will take measures like building ads into the core technology of their software so blocking ads will break other features. Also many manufacturers will hardcode their DNS to their preferred vendor, not allowing you to override their option with your PiHole. </p></li></ol></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]>

<div>
<p>As one of the poster childs for bad programming languages, PHP has always been in the top 5 “worst programming languages”; however, as of 2021, is that still a thing?</p>

<p>PHP was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> in 1994. Lerdorf developed a bunch of scripts to track the visits to his online resume, and named them as “Personal Home Page Tools”, which then evolved into being called as “PHP Tools”. He kept adding more tools to this suite, and at some point pulled off a rewrite of the tools, including added functionality for database interactions and more, turning it into a more complete framework. From that point on, the tools have evolved into a more complex primitives and kept gaining more users after it is <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi/c/PyJ25gZ6z7A/m/M9FkTUVDfcwJ?pli=1">open-sourced</a> in 1995. A more detailed history of the language can be found in <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/history.php.php">the official PHP website</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, the latest version of the PHP language is 8.0.</p>

<p>The language has had a target on its back for years now, and people are rightfully calling out the bad taste they have with the language, especially with the older versions. The language has been developed with the intention of being a templating language, rather than being a full-blown programming language; therefore, there are some downsides with it that made it especially harder to maintain larger apps.</p>
<h2 id="weak-typing">Weak Typing</h2>
<p>One part of the language that I personally dislike is the weak typing that allows combining different types and casts them implicitly. Consider the following example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3"</span><span>;</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The results of all these operations are <code>4</code>, which means the language casts the numbers in the string to integers in the context of the addition operator. This might be desirable in some cases or it might save a few lines of code here and there, but the larger a project gets, the harder it becomes to maintain it.</p>
<p>The more recent versions of the language have started introducing warnings for these kinds of weird and invalid operations, which means that they are either deprecated or already on their way to be deprecated.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-namespaces">Lack of Namespaces</h2>
<p>The support for namespaces has been introduced in PHP by the version 5.3, which means that all the older projects have had to build their own kind of namespacing, which usually relied on adding namespaces to the class and method names, requiring absurdly long names everywhere. For projects that were developed with the prior versions, it is very common to see classes named like <code>Payments_Provider_ProcessorProvider_SomeExternalServiceProvider</code> whereas it could have been named like <code>SomeExternalServiceProvider</code> simply. This results in very verbose code in most of the cases, and it makes it harder to read and skim through the code.</p>
<p>The more recent versions of the language doesn’t have this problem though.</p>
<h2 id="inconsistent-standard-library-functions">Inconsistent Standard Library Functions</h2>
<p>I am not saying the standard library of the language is bad, but one could argue that it could have been better. To be fair, the language has been improving quite a lot, but the early versions of the standard library, which is already being used, referenced and supported due to backwards compatibility results, were lacking consistency. Although a small disturbance, this meant that many of the standard library functions had different naming conventions, argument names and ordering, making it harder to assume the defaults and the behavior.</p>
<p>Here are some naming inconsistencies with the string methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php"><code>strpos(string $haystack, string $needle, int $offset = 0): int|false</code></a>: Find the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-split.php"><code>str_split(string $string, int $length = 1): array</code></a>: Convert a string to an array.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php"><code> explode(string $separator, string $string, int $limit = PHP_INT_MAX): array</code></a>: Split a string by a string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three different functions, one with a <code>str</code> prefix, another with <code>str_</code> prefix, and the third with no prefix. The <code>$string</code> argument is the first argument for <code>str_split</code>, but the second one for the <code>explode</code> one. You can check out all the string methods <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.strings.php">in the documentation</a>, and each of these patterns have many functions following similar patterns, meaning that there is not much of a consistency with these functions.</p>
<h2 id="superglobals">Superglobals</h2>
<p>More of personal choice, but I hate the use of the globals, and consequently <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php">superglobals</a>. Especially if you run into some home-baked old projects, it is highly likely that you’ll run into the famous variables like <code>$_SERVER</code> or <code>$_REQUEST</code>. Don’t get me wrong, these are very helpful sometimes and will need to be used eventually; however, encapsulating these into reusable classes should be done as one of the first steps in order to be able to use these values safely. If not, touching these values or doing any change in a slightly larger project gets a very complicated experience where there are many hidden dependencies on these values.</p>

<p>Even though it had left a bad taste in many people’s mouth, the language itself has been improving quite a lot in the last few years. With the release of PHP 7, the language has gone through a modernization process where many nice features were introduced to the language basics, the speed was improved, and the usability has increased quite a lot.</p>
<h2 id="type-hints">Type-hints</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite ways of modernizing legacy PHP code: using non-enforced type-hints that handle type casting as well as providing documentation for the code. Check out the following simple function:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>isValueSomething</span><span>(</span><span>$value</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you include the type hints, it becomes something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>isValueSomething</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> <span>$value</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Just by looking at the signature, we are able to tell it expects a string value, and it will return a boolean result. One could claim that the naming convention could have been useful here as well, but these type-hints reassure that the values will be of those types, as well as giving the IDE a lot of power for auto-complete and static analysis with warnings and stuff.</p>
<p>Since PHP 7.4, PHP allows defining typed properties for classes as well:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>;</span> 

    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This means your <code>Person</code> objects will have string first and last names, an integer age, and a nullable string value for the job. Being able to define this becomes very useful the more classes you have.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-improvements">Syntax Improvements</h2>
<p>PHP now has bunch of syntactical improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arrow.php">Arrow functions</a>: <code>fn ($x, $y) =&gt; $x + $y;</code></li>
<li>Null coalescing operator: <code>$value = $array['key'] ?? 'default value';</code></li>
<li>Null coalescing assignment: <code>return $cache['key'] ??= computeSomeValue('key')</code>;</li>
<li>Array spreading: <code>$first = ['a', 'b']; $second = ['c', 'd']; $final = [...$first, ...$second];</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.named-arguments">Named arguments</a>: <code>array_fill(start_index: 0, num: 100, value: 50);</code></li>
<li>Numeric literal separator: <code>299_792_458</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these syntactical improvements, it also includes stuff for more complex improvements.</p>
<h3 id="constructor-promotion"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php#language.oop5.decon.constructor.promotion">Constructor Promotion</a></h3>
<p>Look at the following Person class:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>;</span>

    <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>;</span> 

    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span><span>(</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>,</span>
        <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span>
    <span>){</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>firstName</span> <span>=</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>lastName</span> <span>=</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>$age</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>job</span> <span>=</span> <span>$job</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Instead of having this unnecessarily verbose code, PHP 8 supports writing the following code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span><span>(</span>
        <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>,</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span>
    <span>){}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="nullsafe-operator"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php#language.oop5.basic.nullsafe">Nullsafe Operator</a></h3>
<p>This is something that had existed in some other languages like Javascript but PHP didn’t have the support for this. Take a look at the following code which I grabbed from the PHP docs:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>is_null</span><span>(</span><span>$repository</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>$user</span> <span>=</span> <span>$repository</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>is_null</span><span>(</span><span>$user</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>$user</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This was how the logic would be written with the older PHP versions with respect to null-checks. The new nullsafe operator allows converting this to simply:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>$repository</span><span>?-&gt;</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>?-&gt;</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Isn’t it gorgeous?</p>
<h3 id="union-types"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php#language.types.declarations.union">Union Types</a></h3>
<p>Even though this is a less favorite feature of mine, it is still valuable for the cases where there is already multiple possible types and we don’t type-hint anything. Union types simply allow defining multiple types for a value as options. Thanks to the union types, the following code becomes valid:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>|</span><span>string</span> <span>$value</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>|</span><span>array</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Usually having multiple return types indicate an opportunity for improvement, but previous versions of PHP didn’t allow us to define types for cases like these at all, so having this is still an improvement.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>I don’t have any hard numbers compared to other languages, but PHP has improved significantly over time compared to the previous versions. In addition to the jump PHP 7 brought over PHP 5.6, all the consecutive releases have brought several percent-point improvements at least and the trend is continuing. Some benchmarks <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=php-74-benchmarks&amp;num=2">done by Phoronix</a> show that the latest PHP 8 is more than 3x faster than PHP 5.6. There are more detailed tests in the original posts, make sure to give it a look.</p>

<p>In addition to those benchmarks, Kinsta has also conducted some real-world benchmarks with tools like Wordpress, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/#">full article here</a>. Here’s the result for Wordpress 5.3:</p>
<p><img src="https://saasstarterkit.app/blog/assets/images/posts/is-php-still-relevant/php-benchmark-2.png" alt="PHP Benchmark 2"></p>
<p>The numeric results they have shared are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 5.6 benchmark: <code>97.71 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.0 benchmark results: <code>256.81 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.1 benchmark results: <code>256.99 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.2 benchmark results: <code>273.07 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.3 benchmark results: <code>305.59 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.4 benchmark results: <code>313.42 req/sec</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These benchmarks do not include PHP 8 yet, but the 7.4 is capable of handling 3x requests of 5.6, which is a pretty significant improvement.</p>

<p>Overall, PHP has improved quite a lot over …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
	<td colspan="2">
				<p>Turbo Pascal compiler functions are grouped into several categories/units according to their role in the compiler. This grouping is done only to have a better overview on the individual parts of the compiler. On the other hand, functions from one group usually share common types and variables and therefore it makes sense to place them in separate units.</p>
<h2>Basic facts about Turbo Pascal</h2>
<div><p>Unit files in Turbo Pascal (tpu extension) are actually <a href="http://direct.turbopascal.org/symbol-tables">symbol tables</a> that are <a href="http://direct.turbopascal.org/compacting-symbol-tables">compacted</a> and <a href="http://direct.turbopascal.org/creating-unit-file">saved</a> as individual files. The <a href="http://direct.turbopascal.org/system-unit">System unit</a> is implicitly used in every program or unit. It contains the boot-strap symbol table and compiler procedures. The definition order of these compiler procedures is important because compiler calls them by id number. To compile <a href="http://direct.turbopascal.org/system-unit">System unit</a> you need bootstrap symbol table (SYSTEM.TPS).</p></div>
<p>Boot-strap symbol table contains <a href="http://direct.turbopascal.org/system-type-definitions">system types</a> like Byte, Char, Boolean, port identifiers, memory identifiers, system functions and system procedures.</p>
<div><p>Turbo Pascal library (extension tpl) is simple binary concatenation of one or more units. It is loaded at the compiler start. It should contain at least the system unit. You can create unit with console command copy:</p></div>
<div><pre>copy /b  system.tpu  unit1.tpu  unit2.tpu  turbo.tpl
</pre></div>
<div><p>Turbo Pascal uses low-level <a href="http://direct.turbopascal.org/intermediate-code">intermediate code</a>. Each record can contain target instruction with reference data,  intermediate code instruction for  subroutines or special meta instruction.</p><p>Turbo Pascal relies heavily on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086#Segmentation" target="_blank">segment:offset</a> architecture of the x86 family in the real mode. In many cases this is a limiting factor because many data structures are limited to 64 KB. But on the other hand this comes very convenient when dealing with addresses and offsets.</p></div>		</td>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been living in Silicon Valley for ten years. During this time I've had the privilege to meet many gifted, benevolent, indefatigable people. You've always graciously offered me your time and resources, for no reason other than your love of the startup world. Thank you for paying it forward and sorry I was a pain in the ass.</p><p>We need to talk. Something's rotten in the state of tech. I know it, you know it, everyone who has any sense at all knows it. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are quasi-monopolies programming our brains, and we have no access to the source code. Our institutions are captured by agents who do not share our values, and will not stop until they remake the world in their gruesome image. No one is coming to fix this. No one is in control.</p><p>The turbulence has spilled over onto the national arena. In June, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley wrote a <a href="https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/CJCS%20Memo%20to%20the%20Joint%20Force%20(02JUN2020).pdf">memo</a> to the troops reminding them to uphold the constitution. This is not creative destruction as usual. Here be dragons. But to me the <em>human</em> aspect of this situation is woefully familiar. I try to avoid clichés, but in this case one is eminently appropriate. Social media quasi-monopolies and erosion of our institutions are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>So let's talk about coins. Many of you have house-in-san-francisco-live-off-capital-gains fuck you money. I feel your pain. I really do. You're capable of so much more. Are those take-my-jet-to-south-of-france-while-this-all-blows-over assholes really that much more talented than you? Ok, maybe Zuck is, but he's an exception. Maybe a couple of others, but they're exceptions too. But other than that? No way! Why do they get to sit at the secret tables, pull the secret strings, and live in the future while you're stuck in the present running into your employees at brunch as if you were an ordinary middle manager at Geek Squad?</p><p>I understand your reasoning. You should be at the secret tables! You should be in the South of France! Sit out this political kerfuffle. Live to fight another day. You'll make up for it later, when you finally get to one of those coveted seats. You're a good person. No reason to risk it all now. Better be patient and wait until your time finally comes— that's when you can do the most good.</p><p>This next part is awkward, but some of you <em>are</em> the take-my-jet-to-south-of-france-while-this-all-blows-over assholes. (Is South of France still where assholes with private jets go while everything is falling apart?) I don't understand your world nearly as well, but hey, we're all white males. How different can it be? I'm guessing you have many families depending on you. You plant seeds to improve the world every day— through your investments, your board seats, your philanthropy. You educate politicians and government officials. You coach your kids's middle school football team. Most of America’s taxes come from your pocket. Hell, you probably plant literal trees!</p><p>But between you and me, hanging out with university presidents and having authorized biographers is pretty cool too, isn't it? Some day, say, a century and a half from now, a young entrepreneur somewhere is going to pick up one of those biographies. Can anyone blame you for wanting to live a model life so this kid from the future is properly inspired by your example?</p><p>Let me tell you a less illustrious inspirational story. When I was a kid in Ukraine, I was taking a public bus to get to school. One time a mentally ill man got on. (In that distant world we had no dedicated school buses; this episode was surprising because severely mentally ill people were actually institutionalized.) He began walking up to people's seats and screaming obscenities. I must have been no more than twelve years old, but I vividly remember that scene as if it were yesterday. I can still feel the contrast of this man screaming and the otherwise deathly silence with everyone pretending to look out the window or read their newspapers as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening.</p><p>But Ukraine isn't America. An old babushka looked over the men on the bus and exclaimed: "Are you men or dogshit? Why do you avert your eyes like a bunch of cowards? Did you forget your balls in a jar when you walked out the door this morning the way I sometimes forget my dentures? There are women and children here! Do something!"</p><p>And that was the end of it. The bus driver pulled over, a couple of people forced the man out, and everyone went about their day, shaken, but with this particular problem out of their lives forever.</p><p>I don't mean to sound like an old babushka. I am on your side. I must unwittingly be using hundreds of pieces of software and hardware you've created, just to publish this post. I know the magic you're capable of. I want more of it! Much more! I want AR and VR and civil supersonic aviation and robots and AI and abundant energy and affordable trips to Mars and underwater cities and new physics and space elevators and organ regeneration and an antidote to aging and a thousand other innovations you're going to create that I can't begin to dream of.</p><p>None of that is going to happen without you. But it also isn’t going to happen if you keep hiding in dark corners, whispering your private thoughts when you think no one is listening. If America falls, it is the end. There will be no houses in San Francisco, no seats to covet, no strings to pull, no private jets, and no South of France. Not for you, anyway. And there will be no AR or VR or new physics or space elevators or organ regeneration for me. If she falls, it's back to the dark ages for all of us.</p><p>I don’t know what bewilders me more, your inaction or your performative over-intellectualization, as if reality were a Clubhouse cocktail party. Kuran’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Private-Truths-Public-Lies-Falsification/dp/0674707583/">book</a> (or more likely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification">wikipedia article</a>) isn’t a grimoire, and <em>preference cascade</em> isn’t a magic spell that absolves you of social responsibility every time you utter it. America has given you your houses and your jets, and has asked very little of you in return. It’s <em>still</em> asking very little— you can discharge your civic duty while eating cupcakes in your pajamas.</p><p>So pretty, please, with sugar on top. Make the announcements. Tweet the tweets. Pay off Jack's dealer to slip him placebo strips so he stops microdosing and pretending he's Steve Jobs. Use the photos you took of Zuck and Sundar at the shapeshifter brothel. Hire whoever you have to hire, fire whoever you have to fire, and do whatever you have to do to get this fucking thing off the bus. Make it your singular purpose. Because if you don't, it will be Dick Costolo's livestream <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/10/01/some-business-leader-should-face-a-firing-squad-former-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-suggests-in-angry-tweet/">commentary</a> all the way to the bitter end.</p><p>P.S. All you ordinary folks reading, don't come after me with pitchforks. I could maaaybe ask for a favor or two, but only if they're small and only on a good day and probably not after this post. It's not like we get tested for COVID with secret instantaneous diagnostics only accessible to the elites and go to the shapeshifter brothel together. I don't get invited to those parties. Which is ok by me because parties make me anxious and shapeshifters creep me out.</p></div></div>]]>

December 26, 2020 | https://robertovitillo.com/leader-election-best-practices/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://robertovitillo.com/leader-election-best-practices/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 26, 2020</p></header><p>Sometimes a single process in a system needs to have special powers, like being the only one that can access a shared resource or assign work to others. To grant a process these powers, the system needs to elect a <em>leader</em> among a set of <em>candidate processes</em>, which remains in charge until it crashes or becomes otherwise unavailable. When that happens, the remaining processes detect that the leader is no longer available and elect a new one.</p><p>Leader election can be implemented without any external dependency like the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft algorithm</a> does. Doing so is far from trivial, though, and it’s best avoided unless you have a very good reason to.</p><p>In practice, you can leverage an external <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/what-every-developer-should-know-about-database-consistency/#strong-consistency">linearizable</a> key-value store, like etcd or Zookeeper, which offer abstractions that make it easy to implement leader election. The abstractions span from basic primitives like compare-and-swap to fully-fledged distributed mutexes.</p><p>Ideally, the external store needs to offer atomic compare-and-swap and expiration times (TTL) for keys. A compare-and-swap operation updates the value of a key if and only if the value matches the expected one, while an expiration time defines the time to live for a key, after which the key expires and is removed from the store if the lease hasn’t been extended. Each process tries to acquire a “lease” by creating a new key with a specific TTL using compare-and-swap. The first process to succeed becomes the leader and remains such until it stops renewing the lease, after which another process can become the leader.</p><p>The TTL expiry logic can also be implemented on the client-side, like this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-distributed-locks-with-the-dynamodb-lock-client/">locking library</a> for DynamoDB does, but the implementation is more complex, and it still requires the data store to offer a compare-and-swap operation.</p><p>You might think that’s enough to guarantee there can’t be more than one leader in your application. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.</p><p>To see why, suppose there are multiple processes that need to update a file on a shared blob store, and you want to guarantee that only a single process at a time can do so to avoid race conditions. To achieve that, you decide to use a distributed mutex - a form of leader election. Each process tries to acquire the lock, and the one that does so successfully reads the file, updates it in memory, and writes it back to the store:</p><div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> lock<span>.</span>acquire<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        content <span>=</span> store<span>.</span>read<span>(</span>blob_name<span>)</span>
        new_content <span>=</span> update<span>(</span>content<span>)</span>
        store<span>.</span>write<span>(</span>blob_name<span>,</span> new_content<span>)</span>
    <span>except</span><span>:</span>
        lock<span>.</span>release<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>The problem here is that by the time the process writes the content to the store, it might no longer be the leader - a lot might have happened since it was elected. For example, the operating system might have preempted and stopped the process, and several seconds will have passed by the time it’s running again. So how can the process ensure that it’s still the leader then? It could check one more time before writing to the store, but that doesn’t eliminate the race condition, it just makes it less likely.</p><p>To avoid this issue, the data store downstream needs to verify that the request has been sent by the current leader. One way to do that is by using a fencing token. A <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html">fencing token</a> is a number that increases every time that a distributed lock is acquired - in other words, it’s a logical clock. When the leader writes to the store, it passes down the fencing token to it. The store remembers the value of the last token and accepts only writes with a greater value:</p><div data-language="python"><pre><code>success<span>,</span> token <span>=</span> lock<span>.</span>acquire<span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> success<span>:</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        content <span>=</span> store<span>.</span>read<span>(</span>blob_name<span>)</span>
        new_content <span>=</span> update<span>(</span>content<span>)</span>
        store<span>.</span>write<span>(</span>blob_name<span>,</span> new_content<span>,</span> token<span>)</span>
    <span>except</span><span>:</span>
        lock<span>.</span>release<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>This approach adds complexity as the downstream consumer - in our case, the blob store - needs to support fencing tokens. If it doesn’t, you are out of luck, and you will have to design your system around the fact that occasionally there will be more than one leader. For example, if there are momentarily two leaders and they both perform the same idempotent operation, no harm is done.</p><p>Although having a leader election can simplify the design of a system as it eliminates concurrency, it can become a scaling bottleneck if the number of operations performed by the leader increase to the point where it can no longer keep up. When that happens, you might be forced to re-design the whole system. </p><p>Also, having a leader introduces a single point of failure with a large blast radius - if the election process stops working or the leader isn’t working as expected, it can bring down the entire system with it.</p><p>You can mitigate some of these downsides by introducing partitions and assigning a different leader per partition, but that comes with additional complexity. This is the solution many distributed data stores use.</p><p>Before considering the use of a leader, check whether there other are ways of achieving the desired functionality without it. For example, optimistic locking is one way to guarantee mutual exclusion at the cost of wasting some computing power. Or perhaps high availability is not a requirement for your application, in which case having just a single process that occasionally is restarted after failure is not a big deal. </p><p>As a rule of thumb, if you must use leader election, you have to minimize the work it performs and be prepared to occasionally have more than one leader if you can’t support fencing tokens end-to-end.</p><hr></article></div>]]>

			<p>My working title for this blog post was “Why I’ll Never Fly With easyJet Again”, but that was far too clickbaity. Also it’s probably worth prefixing this post with two things. The first being the caveat that whether or not i ever fly with easyJet again is immaterial to their business, given that the model of budget airlines is one of opportunistic sales. Their loyalty programmes are minimal to non-existent<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (although that may change in the near future<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>) because the nature of their passengers is not one of loyalty. When you’re looking for a short haul cheap flight you’re unlikely to be attracted to schemes that only benefit you after years, or hundreds of thousands of air miles, worth of loyalty.</p>

<p>The reality of the budget airlines is they don’t have to worry about losing future passengers, thousands of them even, because there will always be enough replacement passengers. Budget airlines’ flights average above a 90% occupancy rate<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So the point of me never flying with easyJet again is not because i am under any illusion that it will be detrimental to their business, it won’t, but rather to protect <em>myself</em> should the situation happen again. They’re not the first airline to make my “list”, but the others have reasons that aren’t interesting enough to require a blog post.</p>

<p>What i am hoping with this post is that it gives the reader enough information that, should they find themselves in a similar situation, they are more informed as to their options and the potential ramifications of the choice they make. This is going to affect more travelers when the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>The second prefix is that easyJet recently posted their first year of losses<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">4</a></sup>, due to the current global situation. I started writing this post sometime in 2019, way before the pandemic royally fucked the airline industry. It’s arguable that the airline industry being royally fucked was only a matter of time, and the consequences of <em>that</em> could mean the details here are now even more relevant - It may become even harder to claim refunds and compensation from them in the future. Airline companies will probably double down on their approach to handling compensation claims to avoid yet more financial loss.</p>

<p><strong>EZY1952</strong></p>

<p>On 23rd December 2018 my partner and I were due to fly from Geneva to Manchester on easyJet flight EZY1952, aircraft registration G-EZRU, which was scheduled to depart at 16:50 CET and arrive at 17:50 GMT. I had booked these flights a couple of months earlier, which combined with the date of our departure and return lead to a total cost of 619.38 CHF.</p>

<p>The 600+ CHF didn’t include any of the optional extras, priority boarding, seat choice, checked bags, etc. It was the “basic” cost of the “cheap” flights. This cost is four to five times more than the normal cost of this route, as I said due to the relatively late booking (two months in advance) and the dates of the flights. This route is normally far cheaper:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/typical_cost.png"></p>

<p>Anyway, given the alternatives and the limited options for our dates these were the flights we settled on and decide the cost was worth it to spend Xmas with the family. The flight was delayed by just a few minutes, which isn’t unusual for this route, but then took off as normal at 17:14:05 CET.</p>

<p>A few moments after take off, the literal wheels no longer being on the ground part of it, I felt my ears pop quite suddenly. That might not be taken as unusual either, but I live at altitude and my ears don’t normally pop on flights. The plane then spent several minutes in low cloud, another unusual thing given the cloud line is normally cut through quicker. I turned to my partner and suggested that something was off.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later the pilot informed us that the flight would be returning to Geneva airport as the cabin pressure system, and its backup, had failed. Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of the cabin pressure system failing at cruising altitude, I considered that everyone on the plane had been very lucky.</p>

<p>The plane landed safely at Geneva airport at 17:41:00 CET, meaning a total flight time of about 25 minutes<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup>. I contacted my parents to let them know we wouldn’t be arriving as planned and would keep them informed as to any updates:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/messages_to_mum.png"></p>

<p>We remained on the plane, after the pilot informed us that the technical crew were going to look into the issue. We were then told the parts would be replaced/fixed and this would take three to four hours. At this point I knew that we would not be flying until the next day as a) it was now 19:00 and Geneva airport has strict limitations on flights after 22:00, and b) it would be massively irresponsible of the airline to let this plane fly without a more comprehensive test that would probably take longer than the three to four hour estimate<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since it was going to take a few hours all passengers disembarked and returned to the departure gate. I’m not sure how long we were on the plane, while it was on the ground, but looking at the evidence I kept afterwards it appears that we were on it for approximately one hour fifteen minutes. This is from the time it landed to receiving a text message from easyJet apologising for the delay:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/sorry_for_delay.png"></p>

<p>As soon as we got back into the gate I sat down and checked to see if there were any other flights available. Sure enough there was: we could get a one way easyJet flight to Liverpool, so I booked two seats for a total of 189.26 CHF. This flight would depart at 21:25 CET and arrive at 22:20 GMT, four hours and thirty minutes after our original arrival time.</p>

<p>It should be said at this point I was reasonably confident of a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was highly unlikely the original fight was going to depart that night</li>
  <li>In fact, it would probably be delayed until the next afternoon</li>
  <li>We would have all the inconvenience of that, and lose one third of our time in the UK</li>
  <li>Given the original arrival time was delayed by more than three hours we were covered by EU Regulation 261/2004</li>
  <li>So the airline would have to compensate €250 for each of us, which would at least cover the alternate flights I had booked</li>
</ul>

<p>I was correct on four out of five of these:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/delayed_overnight.png"></p>

<p>Our flight to Liverpool went without issue, and we weren’t the only people to have rebooked from the delayed flight as we overheard some other passengers explaining their situation to the cabin crew<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Contacting easyJet Customer Service</strong></p>

<p>The next day I used easyJet’s contact form to submit a claim under EC261/2004 regulations. I knew this was going to take a long time so figured I may as well start the process as soon as possible. My claim was made on the basis that the original flight had been delayed overnight and I had booked alternate travel arrangements to get to my destination.</p>

<p>I considered the cost of the original flights a sunk cost. I wasn’t actually interested in compensation and I just wanted the cost of the alternate flights refunded, which came in at less than half the amount of compensation EC261/2004 would give considering the length of the delay to the original flight.</p>

<p>The response from easyJet came back quickly, the next day: <em>As you were a no show on the flight we would not be able t reimburse the costs for alternate transport.</em> - well that didn’t read like a response by someone/thing that had actually looked into the details. We had shown up for the flight, given we were on it when the pressure systems failed, and clearly we wouldn’t show up for the <em>rescheduled</em> flight if we arranged alternate transport as we can’t be in two places at once.</p>

<p>I assumed this was just a first level response of “refuse all claims, through a semantic dispute, because this will cause a not insignificant number of people to give up”<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>. The contact form doesn’t have a place to describe the reason for the claim in detail so I needed to call easyJet to explain.</p>

<p><strong>EU Regulation 261/2004</strong></p>

<p>I’ll spare you too much detail, as you can search for it if you want to (or read a summary on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Compensation_Regulation">Wikipedia</a>). Essentially - EU 261/2004 allows compensation if your flight is from or to an EU/EAA area and is either delayed or cancelled [less than one week before the flight date]. The level of compensation depends on the distance of the flight.</p>

<p>In this particular case the delay was more than four hours, and the flight was less than 1,500km, so would qualify for €250 compensation (per passenger).</p>

<p>The regulation also says the passengers must be given assistance, and in this particular case of the flight being delayed overnight would mean hotel accommodation and transport between the airport and the hotel. This was Geneva two days from Xmas, so that would probably mean another €250.</p>

<p>So a reasonable estimate is easyJet would be paying in the region of €750 per passenger on this delayed flight. Given it was full (at least to my recollection) easyJet were looking at a bill of at least €100,000 for compensation + accommodation expenses<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To go off on a tangent slightly - all of this is going to be up in the air when the UK leaves the EU. Of course that depends what the UK government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Compensation_Regulation#Brexit_and_British_Consumers">decide to do about it</a>. Given everything else on their plate don’t be surprised if this one gets forgotten about until the claims start to appear.</p>

<p><strong>Contacting easyJet Customer Service Again</strong></p>

<p>As my claim, via easyJet’s web form, was rejected relatively quickly I decided to pick up the phone and see if speaking to someone would make a difference. I explained the situation and they agreed to pass this on to someone who would look at it in more detail, given the time of year this would take a few days at the least.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks later I received an email stating “Unfortunately as you were a no show on the transferred flight there is no reimbursement for EUC216 Compensation”. But also “As a goodwill gesture I have created a flight voucher to the value of the 51.90 GBP”.</p>

<p>Slightly odd - no …</p></div></div>

<p>One of the peculiar aspects of the Domesday register of 1086 are the range of taxes that the English paid in-kind. &nbsp;Domesday records payments in pigs, in fish, in ale, and in many other types of food. &nbsp;Of these in-kind payments, the one that stands out most to modern viewers is likely the eel-rents. &nbsp;This is in part because, in Europe and the Americas, we have generally moved away from eating eel on anything like a regular basis. Consequently, the idea of eels having any type of social or economic value appears less normal to us the thought of other animals or commodities having negotiable value. &nbsp;We still eat pigs and drink ale. &nbsp;But the eel-rents also stand out for the sometimes excessive numbers of animals at play — the village of Harmston, for example, owed the Earl Hugh 75,000 eels per year, and fishermen in Wisbech needed to pay various local monasteries a combined total of almost 35,000 per year.</p>
<p>Eel-rents usually only find passing mention in history books, and when they do it is these types of rents, with their eye-popping numbers,&nbsp; that dominate. It is worth noting, though, that these numbers, while high, are not out of the range of normal. &nbsp;Domesday and subsequent documents show that rents of multiple thousands of eels a year were common for single fisheries or mills. &nbsp;All told, at the time of the Great Survey in 1086 people living in England owed more than 500,000 eels in taxes each year to their landlords.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to map and present the role of eel-rents in the medieval and early modern English economy. From at least the tenth century onward, the English all across the island paid some taxes in eel (live and dead). English eel-rents have long been understudies and misunderstood, and this project demonstrates both the breadth, and the depth, of the rents in English history.</p>
<p>Most studies that discuss eel-rents tend to focus on their role only the economy of the Fens in East Anglia, but in truth renters all across the island paid their taxes in the fish. And while eel-rents did slowly vanish as coins became more common, they did not wholly vanish. Rather, eel-rents remained a wide-spread and viable part of the English economy into the fifteenth century, with scattered rents remaining active for another two hundred years after that.</p>

December 26, 2020 | http://hongchao.me/cli-and-emacs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hongchao.me/cli-and-emacs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most popular arguments against Emacs is that it is “a great
operating system, lacking only a decent editor”. The promotion of the
idea of “Living in Emacs” by some of the hardcore Emacs users only
make this argument more compelling. At the first glance, using a
single program for “everything” does seem to contradict the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix
philosophy</a>, which
favors single-purposed programs that compose really well instead of
monolithic systems that try to solve many complex problems at the same
time. In this article, I’d like to argue that Emacs largely follows
the Unix philosophy in its problem domain: <em>working with text</em>, and
can be seen as a two dimentional version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line
interface</a>
(CLI).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do
it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle
text streams, because that is a universal interface.</p>

  <p>McIlroy, head of the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many CLI tools stood the test of time. Programs like <em>find</em>, <em>grep</em>,
<em>awk</em>, etc have been indispensable for IT professionals for
decades. They are effective, sometimes more so than their GUI
counterparts, because command line interpreters such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell">Bash</a> provides an
environment where they can be composed together to accomplish tasks
that the original designer of the individual program have never
thought about. For example, through the composition of <em>kubectl</em>,
<em>grep</em>, <em>awk</em> and <em>base64</em>, the following command displays the content
of the <em>tls.crt</em> certificate in a Kubernetes secret called
<em>nioctib-tech-it-tls</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://hongchao.me/images/compose-cli.png" alt="compose cli"></p>

<p>The following two things are quintessential to the composibility and
extensibility of the CLI programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text streams as the univeral interface</li>
  <li>Command line interpreter as a programming environment</li>
</ul>

<p>There are definitely disadvantages to use text streams as the
universal interface between programs due to its lack of structure. But
the timelessness of many of the programs following this pattern and
the prosperity that it brings to the CLI ecosystem proved its
effectiveness as a design choice. Text can be read by both human and
programs. It can be manipulated, printed, stored, trasferred, version
controlled with the tools of your choice. For programs that do not
inheritantly require structured data, using text streams as interface
provides the most flexibility and composibility.</p>

<p>However, the flip side is that for programs that do require structured
data, such as browsers, image viewers, music players, etc. Their text
based versions usually become the toys of the hobbyists with
neglectable impact.</p>

<p><img src="http://hongchao.me/images/lynx-browser.png" alt="lynx browser">
<span>Lynx: a text based browser with tiny user base</span></p>

<p>Another important contributor to the success of many of the CLI
programs is the fact that they live in a programmable environment. In
Bash, programs can be written from scratch or glued together using
Bash script. This makes the CLI environment infinitely extensible. By
enabling smaller programs that “do one thing and do it well” work
together to accomplish more complex tasks, it becomes an environment
that boosts synergy, productivity and creativity.</p>

<p>The word “line” in the CLI (Command-line interface) environment
indicates its one dimentional nature. For programs that potentially
need to interact with (two-dimentional) text files, Emacs offers an
environment with similiar characteristics that makes CLI enviornment
successful: A universal text interface and a programming environment
which enables infinite extensibility.</p>

<p>Self described as “an extensible, customizable, free/libre text
editor”, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs">GNU Emacs</a>’s
infinite extensibility is enabled by a Turing-complete language called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">Elisp</a>, which also is used
to write most of Emacs itself. This is similiar to how for example
Bash achieves its extensibility through Bash script. Just like most of
the programs that thrives under the Bash environment are inheritantly
text focused, most of the popular Emacs programs are text focused as
well, such as <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a> and
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>. They also tend to integrate very
well with other Emacs programs, creating synergy similiar to that of
the CLI programs. For example, you can look at the commit history of a
Git repository using Magit, jump directly to the diff of a commit, and
then jump straight to the source code in the diff. In the following
example, the source code is written in Scala, you can then edit the
code with Emacs’s exellent Scala support thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode">lsp-mode</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-metals">lsp-metals</a>, which are
programs in the Emacs ecosystem that Magit is not aware of at all.</p>

<p><img src="http://hongchao.me/images/magit-code.png" alt="magit">
<span>Magit: jumping from commit to diff to source code</span></p>

<p>If Emacs is an environment for programs that focus on two dimensional
text, it is also more than capable of running programs that deal with
one dimensional text. In fact, many CLI tools such as <em>grep</em>, <em>find</em>
and many file system management utilities
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dired">Dired</a>) are implemented in
Elisp and thus integrated into the Emacs ecosystem as well. This is
one of the reasons that if your main workflow is text focused, “Living
in Emacs” is probably not a terrible idea due to the synergy many of
these Emacs programs produce.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean that <em>everything</em> should be run in
Emacs. Emacs is probably not the best tool for browsing web
(<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html">EWW</a>)
or listening to music
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMMS_(media_player)">EMMS</a>), just like
CLI tools such as Lynx will never have significant impact because they
are fundamentally not text focused. The argument that Emacs is “a
great operating system, lacking only a decent editor” tries to paint
Emacs as a monolithic swiss army knife ambitious enough to run any
programs. In fact, Emacs is more like a two dimensional CLI
environment that embraces the same Unix philosophy: enable simple,
elegant programs interacting with each other using an univeral
interface.</p>

<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/peek.webm"><video src="https://djharper.dev/img/peek.webm" loop="true" width="100%" title="The pixels have been adjusted in colour slightly." autoplay=""></video></a>
<figcaption><br>It's an image <i>and</i> a program</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A few weeks ago I was reading about <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>, a fantasy games console with limited constraints. What really piqued my interest about it was the novel way games are distributed, you encode them into a PNG image. This includes the game code, assets, everything. The image can be whatever you want, screenshots from the game, cool artwork or just text. To load them you pass the image as input to the PICO-8 program and start playing.</p>
<p>This got me thinking, wouldn’t it be cool if you could do that for programs on Linux? No! I hear you cry, that’s a dumb idea, but whatever, herein lies an overview of possibly the dumbest things I’ve worked on this year.</p>
<h2 id="encoding">Encoding</h2>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what PICO-8 is actually doing, but at a guess it’s probably use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> techniques to ‘hide’ the data within the raw bytes of the image. There are a lot of resources out there that explain how Steganography works, but the crux of it is quite simple, your image your want to hide data into is made up of bytes, an image is made up of pixels. Pixels are made up of 3 Red Green and Blue (RGB) values, represented as 3 bytes. To hide your data (the “payload”) you essentially “mix” the bytes from your payload with the bytes from the image.</p>
<p>If you just replaced each byte in your cover image with the bytes from your payload, you would end up with sections of the image looking distorted as the colours probably wouldn’t match with what your original image was. The trick is to be as subtle as possible, or <em>hide in plain sight</em>. This can be achieved by <em>spreading</em> your payload bytes over the bytes of the cover image by using the <em>least significant bits</em> to hide them in. In other words, make subtle adjustments to the byte values so the colour changes are not drastic enough to be perceptive by the human eye.</p>
<p>For example if your payload was the letter <code>H</code>, represented as <code>01001000</code> in binary (72), and your image contained a series of black pixels</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/byte-replace1.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/byte-replace1.png" title="The bits from the input bytes are spread across 8 output bytes by hiding them in the least significant bit"></a>
<figcaption><br>The bits from the input bytes are spread across 8 output bytes by hiding them in the least significant bit</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The output is two-and-a-bit pixels that are slightly less black than before, but can you tell the difference?</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/pixels1.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/pixels1.png" title="The pixels have been adjusted in colour slightly."></a>
<figcaption><br>The pixels have been adjusted in colour slightly.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Well, an exceptionally trained colour connoisseur might be able to, but in reality these subtle shifts can really only be noticed by a machine. Retrieving your super secret <code>H</code> is just a matter of reading 8 bytes from the resulting image and re-assembling them back into 1 byte. Obviously hiding a single letter is lame, but this can scale to anything you want, a super secret sentence, a copy of <em>War and Peace</em>, a link to your soundcloud, the go compiler, the only limit is the amount of bytes available in your cover image as you’ll require at least 8x whatever your input is.</p>
<h2 id="hiding-programs">Hiding programs</h2>
<p>So, back to the whole linux-executables-in-an-image thing, that old chestnut. Well, seeing as executables are just bytes, they can be hidden in images. Just like in the PICO-8 thing.</p>
<p>Before I could achieve this I decided to write my own <a href="https://github.com/djhworld/steg">Steganography library</a> and <a href="https://github.com/djhworld/stegtool">tool</a> to support encoding and decoding data into PNGs. Yes, there are lots of steganography libraries and tools out there but I learn better by building.</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ stegtool encode <span>\
</span><span></span>--cover-image htop-logo.png <span>\
</span><span></span>--input-data /usr/bin/htop <span>\
</span><span></span>--output-image htop.png
$
$ <span>echo</span> <span>"Super secret hidden message"</span> | stegtool encode <span>\ </span>
--cover-image image.png <span>\
</span><span></span>--output-image image-with-hidden-message.png
$ stegtool decode --image image-with-hidden-message.png
Super secret hidden message</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>As it’s all written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> it wasn’t that difficult to compile to WASM, so feel free to play with it here:</p>

<p>Anyway, now that can embed data, including executables into an image, how do we run them?</p>
<h2 id="get-it-running">Get it running</h2>
<p>The simple option would be to just run the tool above, <code>decode</code> the data into a new file, <code>chmod +x</code> it and then run it. It works but that’s not fun enough. What I wanted was something similar to the PICO-8 experience, you pass something a PNG image and it takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>However, as it turns out, you can’t just load some arbitrary set of bytes into memory and tell Linux to jump to it. Well, not in a direct way anyway, but you <em>can</em> use some cheap tricks to fudge it.</p>
<h2 id="memfd-create">memfd_create</h2>
<p>After reading <a href="https://magisterquis.github.io/2018/03/31/in-memory-only-elf-execution.html">this blogpost</a> it became apparent to me you can create an in-memory file and mark it as executable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to just grab a chunk of memory, put our binary in there, and run it without monkey-patching the kernel, rewriting execve(2) in userland, or loading a library into another process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This method uses the syscall <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create(2)</a> to create a file under the <code>/proc/self/fd</code> namespace of your process and load any data you want in it using <code>write</code>. I spent quite a while messing around with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/libc">libc</a> bindings for Rust to get this to work, and had a lot of trouble understanding the data types you pass around, the documentation for these Rust bindings doesn’t help much.</p>
<p>I got something working eventually though</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>unsafe</span><span> </span>{<span>

</span><span>        </span>file,<span>
</span><span>    </span>);<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>Invoking <code>/proc/self/fd/&lt;fd&gt;</code> as a child process from the parent that created it is enough to run your binary.</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span><span> </span>output<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>Command::new(format<span>!</span>(<span>"/proc/self/fd/{}"</span>,<span> </span>fd))<span>
</span><span>    </span>.args(args)<span>
</span><span>    </span>.stdin(std::process::Stdio::inherit())<span>
</span><span>    </span>.stdout(std::process::Stdio::inherit())<span>
</span><span>    </span>.stderr(std::process::Stdio::inherit())<span>
</span><span>    </span>.spawn();<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>Given these building blocks, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/djhworld/pngrun">pngrun</a> to run the images. It essentially…</p>
<ol>
<li>Accepts an image that has had our binary embedded in it from the steganography tool, and any arguments</li>
<li>Decodes it (i.e. extracts and re-assembles the bytes)</li>
<li>Creates an in-memory file using <code>memfd_create</code></li>
<li>Puts the bytes of the binary into the in-memory file</li>
<li>Invokes the file <code>/proc/self/fd/&lt;fd&gt;</code> as a child process, passing any arguments from the parent</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can run it like this</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ pngrun htop.png
&lt;htop output&gt;
$ pngrun go.png run main.go
Hello world!</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>Once <code>pngrun</code> exits the in-memory file is destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="binfmt-misc">binfmt_misc</h2>
<p>It’s annoying having to type <code>pngrun</code> every time though, so my last cheap trick to this pointless gimmick was to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc">binfmt_misc</a>, a system that allows you to “execute” files based on its file types. I think it was mainly designed for interpreters/virtual machines, like Java. So instead of typing <code>java -jar my-jar.jar</code> you can just type <code>./my-jar.jar</code> and it will invoke the <code>java</code> process to run your JAR. The caveat is your file <code>my-jar.jar</code> needs to be marked as executable first.</p>
<p>So adding an entry to binfmt_misc for <code>pngrun</code> to attempt to run any <code>png</code> files that have the <code>x</code> flag set was as simple as</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat /etc/binfmt.d/pngrun.conf
:ExecutablePNG:E::png::/home/me/bin/pngrun:
$ sudo systemctl restart binfmt.d
$ chmod +x htop.png
$ ./htop.png
&lt;output&gt;</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<h2 id="what-s-the-point">What’s the point</h2>
<p>Well, there isn’t one really. I was seduced by the idea of making PNG images run programs and got a bit carried away with it, but it was fun none the less. There’s something amusing to me about distributing programs as an image, remember the ridiculous cardboard boxes PC software used to come in with artwork on the front, why not bring that back! (lets not)</p>
<p>It’s really dumb though and comes with a lot of caveats that make it completely pointless and impractical, the main one being needing the stupid <code>pngrun</code> program on your machine. But I also noticed some weird stuff around programs like <code>clang</code>. I encoded it into this fun LLVM logo and while it runs OK, it fails when you try to compile something.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/DragonMedium.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/DragonMedium.png" title="Clang/LLVM logo"></a>
</figure>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ./clang.png --version
clang version <span>11</span>.0.0 <span>(</span>Fedora <span>11</span>.0.0-2.fc33<span>)</span>
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /proc/self/fd
$ ./clang.png main.c
error: unable to execute command: Executable <span>""</span> doesn<span>'</span>t exist!</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>This is probably a product of the anonymous file thing, which can probably be overcome if I could be bothered to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="additional-reasons-why-this-is-dumb">Additional reasons why this is dumb</h3>
<p>A lot of binaries are quite large, and given the constraints of needing to fit them into an image, sometimes these need to be <em>big</em>, meaning you end up with comically large files.</p>
<p>Also most software isn’t just one executable so the dream of just distributing a PNG kinda falls flat for more complex software like games.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is probably the dumbest project I’ve worked on all year but it’s been fun, I’ve learned about Steganography, <code>memfd_create</code>, <code>binfmt_misc</code> and played a little more with Rust.</p>

After the 6 months period, all the odd release numbers (9, 11, 13, 15, etc.) move to the state of <em>Unsupported</em>, while even releases (10, 12, 14, etc.) are promoted to <em>Long Term Support</em> (or "LTS").</li><li><strong>LTS</strong>: releases marked as "Long Term Support" get critical bug fixes for a total of 30 months since the initial publish date. This makes LTS releases particularly suitable for production deployments. The most recent LTS is also called <em>Active LTS</em>, while previous LTS versions (still under the 30 months support timeframe) are called <em>Maintenance LTS</em>.</li></ul><p>Finally, the release coming from the current <em>master</em> branch is considered <strong>Unstable</strong>. This is generally a release dedicated to people maintaining Node.js or developers who want to explore new experimental features that haven't been yet included in any of the major releases.</p><p>Node.js publishes an <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/">official timeline of current and future releases</a>. At the time of writing (December 2020), this how the timeline looks like:</p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Node.js release timeline" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/nodejs-release-schedule_9b4bf060.svg" width="760" height="396"></p></a><p>If you are still wondering which release should you use, going with the <em>Active LTS</em> is almost always the best choice, especially if you are building production applications.</p><h2 id="install-node.js-using-n">Install Node.js using n</h2><p>Since installing Node.js using a version manager seems to be the favourite option (and it's also my personal favourite!) let's start with it.</p><p>My favourite Node.js version manager is <a href="https://github.com/tj/n"><code>n</code> by TJ Holowaychuk</a>. The reason why I like it is because it is quite simple to install and use and it is generally up to date with the latest releases of Node.js. The main issue with it is that it does not support Windows, so if Windows is your operative system, this is not an option for you!</p><p>Let's see how to install <code>n</code>:</p><p>If you are on macOS and you have <code>brew</code> (Homebrew) installed, the simplest way to install <code>n</code> is to just do it with <code>brew</code>:</p><pre><code>brew <span>install</span> n</code></pre><p>Alternatively, you can use the custom install script:</p><pre><code><span>curl</span> -L https://git.io/n-install <span>|</span> <span>bash</span></code></pre><p>If all goes well, you should now be able to use the <code>n</code> executable from your shell.</p><p>These are some of the commands you can run:</p><pre><code><br>n --version<p><br>n lts</p><p><br>n list</p><p><br>n <span>&lt;</span>some_version<span>&gt;</span></p></code></pre><p>Or you can simply run:</p><pre><code>n</code></pre><p>For an interactive prompt that will show you all the available versions, highlight the ones you have already installed and let you pick the version you want to switch to.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="n Node.js version manager in action" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/n_ac172e26.gif" width="640" height="428"></p><p>In summary, this is where <code>n</code> shines or falls short:</p><ul><li>ðŸ‘Ž No official support for Windows</li><li>ðŸ‘� Very easy to install on macOS and unix systems</li><li>ðŸ‘� Very easy to keep your Node.js install up to date and switch version on demand</li><li>ðŸ‘� It keeps all the installed versions cached, so you can switch quickly between versions (no full re-install)</li><li>ðŸ‘� Allows to keep the setup local to the user so you don't have to use admin permission to install global packages</li></ul><h2 id="install-node.js-using-nvm">Install Node.js using nvm</h2><p>With more than 45 thousand stars on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"><code>nvm</code></a>, which stands for "Node.js Version Manager" (no surprises!), is probably the most famous Node.js version manager currently available.</p><p><code>nvm</code> works on any POSIX-compliant shell (<code>sh</code>, <code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, <code>zsh</code>, <code>bash</code>, etc.) and it has been strongly tested against the following systems: unix, macOS, and windows WSL.</p><p>The easiest way to install <code>nvm</code> on your system is to use the official installer script:</p><pre><code><span>VERSION</span><span>=</span>v0.37.2<br><span>curl</span> -o- <span>"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/<span>${VERSION}</span>/install.sh"</span> <span>|</span> <span>bash</span></code></pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: At the time of writing, version <code>v0.37.2</code> is the latest version available. Make sure to check out if there is any new version available if you are installing <code>nvm</code> following this tutorial.</p><p>Once <code>nvm</code> is installed in your system, here are some examples showing what you can do with it:</p><pre><code><br>nvm <span>install</span> node<p><br>nvm <span>install</span> --lts</p><p><br>nvm <span>install</span> <span>"10.10.0"</span></p><p><br>nvm use <span>"8.9.1"</span></p><p><br>nvm <span>exec</span> <span>"4.2"</span> node somescript.js</p><p><br>nvm <span>which</span> <span>"4.2"</span></p><p><br>nvm <span>ls</span></p></code></pre><p>One great thing about <code>nvm</code> is that it allows to specify the Node.js version you want to use for a given project.</p><p>For instance, if you are working on a project that requires you to use Node.js <code>10.10</code> you can do the following (in the root folder of the project):</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"10.10"</span> <span>&gt;</span> .nvmrc</code></pre><p>Then every time you work on that project, you only need to run:</p><pre><code>nvm use</code></pre><p>Which should print something like this:</p><pre><code>Found '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version &lt;10.10&gt;
Now using node v10.10.1 (npm v6.7.3)
</code></pre><p>At this point, you can be sure that you working using the correct Node.js version for your project.</p><p>If you don't want to do manually, you can enable <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration">deeper shell integration</a> to make this happen automatically when you <code>cd</code> into a folder that has a <code>.nvmrc</code> file.</p><p><strong>PRO tip</strong>: You can also do that by using <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/"><code>asdf</code></a>, a <em>meta</em> version manager that offers a unified interface for various programming languages and version managers (including Node.js, of course).</p><p>Finally, here are some pros and cons of <code>nvm</code>:</p><ul><li>ðŸ‘� Most popular version manager for Node.js with a large community of users.</li><li>ðŸ‘� Very easy to install on POSIX systems.</li><li>ðŸ‘� It allows for easy (and even automated) switch of Node.js version based on the project you are working on.</li><li>ðŸ‘� It keeps all the installed versions cached, so you can switch quicly between versions (no full re-install)</li><li>ðŸ‘� You can run once off commands on a given version of Node.js without having to switch the entire system to that version.</li><li>ðŸ‘Ž You might have to take a bit of time to go through the documentation and make sure you install it and use it correctly.</li></ul><h2 id="install-node.js-using-the-official-installer">Install Node.js using the official installer</h2><p>The second most common way to install Node.js is through one of the official installers or the pre-compiled binaries.</p><p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Official installers</a> are available on the official Node.js website for Windows and macOS and they cover the latest <em>Active LTS</em> release and the latest <em>Current</em> release.</p><p>The installer for Windows is an executable <em>.msi</em> installer, while the one for macOS is a <em>.pkg</em> one.</p><p>These installers behave and look like most of the installers you see while installing software on Windows or macOS.

			<p>Netflix no longer has any Johnny Depp films streaming in their American library. Coincidence or reaction to his legal loss?</p>
	
					
	<p>Though there has been no official statement from <em>Netflix</em>, the streaming giant has apparently removed all <em>Johnny Depp</em> titles from its American library. This news comes on the heels of actor <strong>Shia LaBeouf</strong> being removed from Netflix’s award consideration website&nbsp;and publicity materials following&nbsp;recent allegations&nbsp;of&nbsp;physical, emotional, and mental abuse. As of this writing, several titles with LaBeouf were still on Netflix. Likewise, Depp titles can still be accessed on Netflix outside the United States.</p>
<p>Depp <a href="https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/johnny-depp-loses-to-the-sun-amber-heard-in-gripping-uk-court-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost a high-profile libel case</a> in the UK last month against the Sun who called the fading former A-lister a wifebeater. In his decision, <strong>Judge Nicol</strong> said, “taking all evidence together, I accept [<strong>Amber Heard</strong>] was the victim of sustained and multiple assaults by Depp. I accept her evidence of the nature of the assaults he committed against her. They must have been terrifying.”</p>
<p>This may have been a delayed reaction to the results of that trial, timed to correspond with their actions on LaBeouf, or it may just be part of Netflix’s standard cycling of titles in and out of their library.</p>
<p>The former Captain Jack Sparrow was also featured in a <a href="https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/the-hollywood-reporters-devastating-expose-on-johnny-depp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scathing article</a> by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> earlier this month in which several Hollywood insiders portrayed him as toxic.</p>
<p>According to satista.com, Netflix had 195.15 million paid subscribers worldwide as of the third quarter&nbsp;<b>of 2020</b>. Most Netflix subscribers are based in the United States, with the U.S. accounting for over&nbsp;<b>73 million</b> of Netflix’s total global subscriber base.&nbsp; They’re not likely to be intimidated by threats of boycotts from fans of Johnny Depp. Disney + still has several available to stream, but they’re under a boycott by Depp fans already.</p>

December 26, 2020 | https://deislabs.io/posts/still-rusting-one-year-later/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deislabs.io/posts/still-rusting-one-year-later/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>It has been about a year since the DeisLabs team starting using Rust in a “serious” project. About this time last year, we started work on what became the <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> project. Since then, we have been using Rust extensively across our projects and have learned a ton more about the language’s strengths and weaknesses. As “Rust After the Honeymoon” posts currently seem to be all the rage, we thought we could contribute a little to the discussion with our experiences writing applications for the cloud world.</p>

<p>This post is organized using the classic (if not tired) good, bad, and ugly structure. In the bad and ugly sections, everything is stated as points of feedback and is not meant as a complaint. The whole point of this post is to go beyond the more superficial parts of the language and into things that really make a difference in our day-to-day programming work. Spoiler alert: We still <em>really</em> like Rust, so all of this is intended as helpful data for those working on the language, to give people new to the language a good idea of some of the things they might run into, and to help others evaluate Rust for their own use. We have tried to incorporate ideas of possible solutions, no matter how vague, to the problems we bring up.</p>

<p>At the very end, we also have a bonus feature about Go and Rust. Given the team’s background in many Go projects, we often hear something like this: “Well, what about Go? Do you regret moving to Rust? What do you miss from Go?” Addressing this in the context of our discussion of Rust felt like a smart decision. If you don’t care about that topic or it doesn’t interest you, feel free to skip it.</p>

<p>Now with that out of the way, let’s get going!</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<h3 id="traits">Traits</h3>

<p>First up, let’s talk about traits. We have absolutely loved the trait system in Rust. In particular, we really enjoy the conversion and reference traits (e.g. <code>TryFrom</code>/<code>From</code>, <code>AsRef</code>, <code>FromStr</code>, <code>Deref</code>, etc.). These are great examples of why traits are better than most other interface-style types – because the type itself doesn’t have to implement an interface to be used as another type. <code>FromStr</code> allows any type to implement a way to parse a bare string into a type (really useful for APIs). Another simple example can be found in the many types that implement <code>AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt;</code> or <code>Deref&lt;Type = [u8]&gt;</code>. Instead of having some sort of <code>Bytes</code> interface that all the types have to implement to be able to do operations as if it was a slice of bytes, you can just automatically pick up the methods from the underlying type. Yes, I know you could embed types or use inheritance, but the elegance of this is quite nice. This also allows me to write custom types and have easy/cheap conversions or references to them from other external types. It leads to generic parameters that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// A function that can write anything that can be accessed as bytes:
// write_all("hello!")
// write_all(String::from("hello!"))
// write_all(b"hello!")
fn write_all&lt;T: AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt;&gt;(data: T)

// Or, I can take anything that can be converted to my custom type
fn do_something&lt;T: Into&lt;MyType&gt;&gt;(thing: T)
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, traits allow you to design flexible APIs for users that allow them to latch on to and/or extend the functionality of your code. This leads to my next point – <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-love-letter-to-serde">A Love Letter to Serde</h3>

<p>Allow us to indulge in a brief love letter to Serde, the much-used serialization/deserialization library leveraged across the Rust ecosystem. To us, it is a first-rate product of Rust’s unique combination of features. It leverages macros, traits, and Rust’s emphasis on zero-cost abstractions to create a library that is powerful, easy to use, and performant. Developers can easily add serialization or deserialization with a simple <code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]</code> and then customize deserialization behaviors with attributes. Even if you have to implement it manually, there are plenty of docs to read. Once those traits are implemented, any serialization format that has a Serde implementation (like JSON, YAML, etc.) can then serialize or deserialize that data.</p>

<h3 id="error-handling-option-and-iter">Error handling, <code>Option</code>, and <code>Iter</code></h3>

<p>Another thing high on our “impressive Rust features” list is an amazing set of mapping, unwrapping, and iteration tools. The built in <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types combined with their various mapping methods (and <code>if let</code> or <code>let thing = match {...}</code>) makes it easy to handle errors/missing data in an easy to read way. It also nudges you towards clean and readable error handling patterns (like the try <code>?</code> operator), which is helpful for people new to the language. On top of the error handling, we have the <code>Iterator</code> trait and its associated methods. There are a whole suite of chainable filters, maps, splitting, and zipping methods (similar to how LINQ and functional programming languages handle collections) along with the all-powerful <code>collect</code> method. Below is an example from Krustlet that shows unwrapping an optional value and then mapping and filtering from a collection of data:</p>

<pre><code>fn mount_setting_for(key: &amp;str, items_to_mount: &amp;Option&lt;Vec&lt;KeyToPath&gt;&gt;) -&gt; ItemMount {
    match items_to_mount {
        None =&gt; ItemMount::MountAt(key.to_string()),
        Some(items) =&gt; ItemMount::from(
            items
                .iter()
                .find(|kp| kp.key == key)
                .map(|kp| kp.path.to_string()),
        ),
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="enums">Enums</h3>

<p>We’ve found Rust enums really expressive and convenient. Rust enums aren’t just single values: they can carry associated data. What’s more, each variant can have a different data structure (like discriminated unions from other languages), and you can work with these different cases using pattern matching. They’re also full-blown types, so you can implement functions and traits on them.</p>

<p>The value of this is that you can bundle a bunch of possible cases into a single type to pass into (or return from) and function. Working with the cases is safe because you don’t need to have optional fields that only may apply to certain cases, and you can only access a case’s data when the enum matches that case. The case structure also encourages code that processes enums to adopt a clear, regular layout, making for some quite beautiful code:</p>

<pre><code>pub enum ClientError {
    /// The item already exists
    AlreadyExists,
    /// The error returned when the request is invalid. Contains the underlying HTTP status code and
    /// any message returned from the API
    InvalidRequest {
        status_code: reqwest::StatusCode,
        message: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    },
    /// A server error was encountered. Contains an optional message from the server
    ServerError(Option&lt;String&gt;),
}

pub fn handle_error(e: ClientError) {
    match e {
        ClientError::AlreadyExists =&gt; {
            println!("Item already exists")
        }
        ClientError::InvalidRequest { status_code, message } =&gt; {
            println!("Invalid request. HTTP code: {}, message: {}", status_code, message.unwrap_or_default())
        }
        ClientError::ServerError(Some(message)) =&gt; {
            println!("Server error: {}", message)
        },
        ClientError::ServerError(None) =&gt; {
            println!("Server error")
        },
        
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we created a simple error type and then unwrapped it according to the data contained inside of each variant. The Rust compiler makes sure we handle all variants of the enum, preventing programmer error (likely from getting distracted by a meme someone posted in chat).</p>

<h3 id="grab-bag">Grab Bag</h3>

<ul>
<li>Macros are awesome and allow you to do some powerful things (and clean up code)</li>
<li>Cargo still has our hearts. It is hands down one of the top dependency manager and build tools we’ve used</li>
<li>To quote a coworker: “NO DAMN NULL POINTERS” (emphasis theirs). You explicitly have to label code as <code>unsafe</code> to even get them</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<h3 id="docs-and-clarity">Docs and Clarity</h3>

<p>As we have been using various crates across the ecosystem, we’ve found some interesting patterns in the documentation. Docs are sometimes unclear on what is happening in the actual code. They describe the functionality well, but we generally have to go digging through the code to find out whether it is truly a zero cost abstraction or if there are possible side effects to what we are doing. When you first start on projects, generally these kinds of details don’t matter. But as you start doing things that require more advanced usage, you end up digging under the hood to see what exactly is going on. For example, if we are using a library that writes data to disk, make sure to clarify which methods flush data or close things down.</p>

<p>Related to this, but slightly different, is trait documentation. As users, if we are trying to find out how we can customize behavior, we always end up jumping through a million functions, looking at all the trait bounds, before we can figure out what we need to implement (It also seems to always be a trait imported from <em>another</em> crate). An example of this from some recent work on Krustlet. We were using the <a href="https://docs.rs/tonic/0.3.1/tonic/"><code>tonic</code></a> crate and implementing a socket listener for the server. We ended up at one of the functions that allows for a custom handler, but that had 3-4 distinct bounds, 2 of which were traits from external crates. We eventually found an example in the crate repo and it wasn’t too difficult, but there was no clear documentation what needed to be implemented without digging more. This experience is <em>really really frustrating</em> for new Rust developers and we’ve seen this in multiple crates. The suggestion here would be to put a little more polish into describing what precisely needs to be implemented (even if just linking to an example) on functions with multiple trait bounds.</p>

<h3 id="missing-pieces">Missing Pieces</h3>

<p>Something to be aware of coming into the Rust ecosystem is that a lot of crates are still missing features. A recent example of this was finding out that there isn’t much support for <code>multipart</code> content types in HTTP requests except for <code>multipart/form-data</code>. This is not meant to be a complaint against any developer of any crate. We …</p></div></div>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25547448">
						
							
								<p>"This reminds me of “The Bell Jar” by Sylvia Plath, which has a quote Aziz Ansari used in his series “Master of None”:&gt; "I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.""</p>
							
						
							
								<p>"Much of my life hasn't played out how I expected. I had dreams like many people in high school and none of them came true. Instead of finishing college I joined the military after the stock market collapse in 2008/9. Impressions were left on me throughout my early life that I only came to know as an adult. My family got sick, I ruined the relationship that I'd worked for, and at times I alienated people close to me out of my own sense of self-defense. I pushed myself to the brink repeatedly. My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger. These things taught me acceptance and forgiveness of both myself and others. Looking back, I would not trade them for an easier or more prestigious life.When I came back from Afghanistan I had to scratch, claw, and climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself. I looked around me when I arrived and I saw Ivy League and top school graduates with multi-million dollar homes, Teslas, and their own literal fig trees in their back yards that complained about everything in life. I've now had the opportunity to live in multiple cultures with varying degrees of prosperity. These things taught me to know my value but to have perspective on what I'm really asking for.Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work. Life isn't about looking back. It isn't even about getting what you want. It's about navigating the road in front of you and making the best of the opportunities in front of you and for everyone around you. All that to say, I've embraced the idea that whatever lies ahead is where I'm supposed to be and I needn't look at what my neighbors value or what they have because I don't care. This life is mine to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p>"This is a fascinating subject. It looks like many people are commenting about alternative realities and that exploring them is a fool's game (BTW. I concur with that).The thing which bothers me is upbeat comments about living here and now and planting the seeds for future changes. It feels like current problems (and desire to wish them away via woulda/counda/shoulda) didn't happen entirely randomly. These problems are a result of systematic behavior/decision making.As an example, it's too easy to say to yourself, "I will start doing sport tomorrow". However, you wake up tomorrow and notice that your day is so busy that you don't have time to do sport until 9pm and by that time you are exhausted and can't do sport. And you repeat the cycle saying, "maybe tomorrow". You start teasing your day apart and find that to squeeze in sport won't require you just to add it, but also to kick something out. And that all the things you have the energy for in the day, you implicitly regarded as more important than sport. And as a result, you are stuck in the loop wishing to do something better but being limited by your other priorities.And frankly, this bothers me way more. The immutability of the past is normal. Being so set in your ways that you can't change the future - this is what scares the shit out of me."</p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

<p>Aside from always having a verb at the end, Japanese does not depend on sequence.  Japanese is a grammar defined by <em>grammar particles</em>, functional “words” that glue on to nouns to indicate what purpose the noun serves.</p>



<p>Here we highlight some common Japanese particles in a slice of the ひらがな [hiragana] syllabary.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1069" height="834" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japanese-particles.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can practice your 🎵 listening comprehension👂 of the ひらがな 🎎 <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">here</a>.  But we digress, Japanese relies on <em>grammatical particles</em> to indicate the <strong>who, what, when,  where, and how</strong> of a sentence.</p>



<h2><strong>Who, what, when, where, and how</strong>.</h2>



<h2>で  (de) <strong>where and how</strong></h2>



<p>For example, で [“deh”] implies <em>manner of accomplishment</em> or <em>setting-locality where something takes place.</em> Mapping to English, we cover the <strong>where</strong> [setting] and <strong>how</strong> [means] with で。</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="246" height="142" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.34.24-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>に (ni) where and when</h2>



<p>For destinations, or specific times, or precise physical points of existence (being), Japanese relies on the use of the <em>grammatical particle</em> に [“ni” as in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIV4poUZAQo">“we are the knights who say…”</a>].  に [“knee!”] therefore covers <strong>where</strong> [destination] and <strong>when</strong> [moment].</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="648" height="446" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.36.55-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>が  (ga) who and what</h2>



<p>The <em>grammatical particle</em> が [“ga”] is used to explain <strong>who</strong> and <strong>what</strong> when used as the <strong>grammatical subjects</strong> of a sentence.  </p>



<p>For example: Vegetables are delicious.  Candy is sweet.<br>  (Veggies are <strong>what</strong> is delicious)<br>  (The candy is <strong>what</strong> is sweet)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="366" height="295" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.38.46-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally, in this brief primer, we want to show the concept of <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong> which we have featured on our <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">“Reverse Engineer Some Japanese”</a> page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="737" height="138" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.41.05-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Within a <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong>, we place a noun and cap off the <strong>jar</strong> with a <strong>lid</strong> containing a <em>grammatical particle</em> such as が、に、で or one of the many others.  </p>



<p>In total, there is an estimated 233 + particles (some are multi-mora, that is, multiple letters) and we teach them in a gradual and comprehensible way in <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=83">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, a sentence-final verb is placed at the end of a sentence.  In English, this would be akin to moving the “is/are” or “be/exists” verb to the end of every sentence.  Japanese fun is.  Grammar easy is.  Japanese-about thinking = interesting is.</p>



<p>So that’s it. You pick your nouns, you pick the <em>grammatical particles</em> to match based on the meaning of <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong>, and you figure out the sentence-final verb element.  Now you’re thinking in Japanese.</p>



<p>Of course, developing the reflex and intuition around this takes some practice, which is why we devised quizzes for Japanese Complete that help train your intuition on the particles, one-by-one.  You can watch a brief video showing some of the quizzes in action on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">free guide page</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Kanji in English Context</h2>



<p>In order to accelerate Kanji comprehension into English context, as you can see in a sonnet by Shakespeare on <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/learning-to-read">this page</a>.  This pattern follows a similar pattern of adoption that native Japanese took: grab kanji from mainland Asia for their ideographic value and smash them together with your native syllabary to add helpful meaning, nuance, and context.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="177" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.46.27-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Temple NI arrive.</strong> [unstated subjects arrive to the temple]</p>



<p><strong>Enter-before NI, hands OH let’s wash, NE.</strong> [before entering, let’s wash our hands, right?]</p>



<p>We’ve created a substack newsletter to share <em>Kanji in English Context </em>once or twice a month, you can <a href="https://japanesecomplete.substack.com/p/coming-soon">sign up for it here</a> if you’re interested in getting interesting <em>Kanji in English Context</em> lessons to your inbox.</p>



<hr>



<p>One great thing about Japanese grammar is that the <strong>bunsetsu jars</strong> can be arranged in any sequence before the final verb, provided each noun has its appropriately matching <em>grammar particle</em> glued on and intact.  This leads to great fun with parsing, as one can create a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=811">rudimentary Japanese grammar parser</a> from a 5-line EBNF grammar.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1349" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osaka-castle.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Hopefully this post made the inner mechanics of Japanese more clear.  Developing intuition and unlocking the language takes study, practice, and determination!  If you’re looking for a program to break the language down logically <strong>and</strong> provide practice and training to help your newfound understanding become intuitive and fast, might we humbly suggest <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap Store</a>, also known as the <cite>Ubuntu Store</cite>, is a commercial centralized software store operated by <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to AppImage or Flatpak the Snap Store is able to provide up to date software no matter what version of Linux you are running and how old your libraries are.</p>

<h3>Centralized control<a href="#centralized-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anyone can create APT repositories and distribute software freely. Users can point to multiple repositories and define priorities. Thanks to the way APT works, if a bug isn’t fixed upstream, Debian can fix it with a patch. If Debian doesn’t, Ubuntu can. If Ubuntu doesn’t Linux Mint can. If Linux Mint doesn’t, anyone can, and not only can they fix it, they can distribute it with a PPA.</p>
<p>Flatpak isn’t as flexible. Still, anyone can distribute their own Flatpaks. If Flathub decides they don’t want to do this or that, anyone else can create another Flatpak repository. Flatpak itself can point to multiple sources and doesn’t depend on Flathub.</p>
<p>Although it is open-source, Snap on the other hand, only works with the Ubuntu Store. Nobody knows how to make a Snap Store and nobody can. The Snap client is designed to work with only one source, following a protocol which isn’t open, and using only one authentication system. Snapd is nothing on its own, it can only work with the Ubuntu Store.</p>
<p>This is a store we can’t audit, which contains software nobody can patch. If we can’t fix or modify software, open-source or not, it provides the same limitations as proprietary software.</p>

<h3>Backdoor via APT<a href="#backdoor-via-apt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When Snap was introduced Canonical promised it would never replace APT. This promise was broken. Some APT packages in the Ubuntu repositories not only install snap as a dependency but also run snap commands as root without your knowledge or consent and connect your computer to the remote proprietary store operated by Canonical.</p>

<p>Following the decision made by Canonical to replace parts of APT with Snap and have the Ubuntu Store install itself without users knowledge or consent, the Snap Store is forbidden to be installed by APT in Linux Mint 20.</p>

        <section id="main_content">
          <p>I just watched a <em>great</em> YouTube video, touching technical, political, and philosophical questions around the whole “who controls the algorithm” topic, from one of those multi-million subscriber channels, spending lots and lots of time and resources on researching and producing. The video was perfect, but the end did upset me slightly. In the end, the sponsoring message was read, and the sponsor was one of those VPN companies, with their usual marketing lingo. You surely know what I am talking about, but let me quote the sponsoring message here for context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your internet connection, right now, is broadcasting your IP address, which is the way people track you online. Check this out [shows a screencap of a website displaying the IP and GeoLocation information], when I go to this website, it tests everything that my internet connection is leaking. You can see my IP address, but you can also see where I am. Your internet connection is doing this right now. Here is how [VPN company] works: It is a Virtual Private Network, you turn it on with one click. My internet traffic is now encrypted, and going through [VPN company]s servers located throughout the world, so people can no longer figure out where I am located. I protect myself online with [VPN company]. […] There is a 30-day money back guarantee which I am confident you are not going to use, because I feel comforted knowing that my personal information is protected on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is another one, from a different channel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all the recent news about online security breaches, it is hard not to worry about where my data goes. Make an online purchase or simply accessing your email puts your private information at risk. You are being tracked online all the time by social media sites, marketing companies, and mobile internet providers. That is why you need to take your internet privacy back right now. Use [VPN company]! [VPN company] has the easiest apps that run seamlessly in the background of any computer, phone, and tablet. Turning on [VPN company] protection only takes one click. I am going to tell you what takes more than one click: getting your identity and data back after it’s been lost. Try getting back the money from your stolen credit cards. Do one click now. [VPN company] secures and anoymizes your internet browsing by encrypting your data and hiding your public IP address.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The popularity of those services and the way they are recommended and promoted is bad. So bad that I feel impelled to write this article on it, to explain two problematic points. Those are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In most circumstances, <strong>VPNs do very little to enhance your data security or privacy</strong> unless paired with other changes.</li>
  <li>Acting as they do, and <strong>promoting commercial VPN providers</strong> as a solution to potential issues <strong>does more harm than good</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just stick around for a bit, and I will explain everything. Before I start, though, let me clarify that I am writing this post with non-technical, but curious people in mind. This means that I will be using simplified terms and sometimes generalize a bit. However, I can assure you that all information is still very accurate. Sometimes, using technical words is necessary to avoid this post becoming inaccurate. If you do not understand something, just read on, the next paragraph might be more apparent.</p>

<h2 id="what-a-vpn-is-and-what-it-is-not">What a VPN is, and what it is not.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] another worrying aspect of today’s market of VPN services is the large misinformation end users are exposed to, which makes it hard for them to properly tell apart vague and bold claims typical of product advertisement campaigns with actual facts.</p>

  <p>- <em>a <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/popets.2015.1.issue-1/popets-2015-0006/popets-2015-0006.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper published in 2015</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://schub.wtf/statics/blog/20190408/vpn-banner.png" alt="VPN - a Very Precarious Narrative"></p>

<p>To start, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> has a very nice summary of what a VPN is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A VPN is a <em>tunnel</em> connecting two different networks. You throw traffic into one end of the tunnel, and it will come out somewhere else, even if the destination might not be reachable on the public internet. VPNs are popular in company environments: Imagine a large company running their servers with private sale data on them. The company does not want those servers to be reachable via the internet for security reasons, but at the same time, salespeople need to be able to access those datasets, even if they are on the road. The salesperson can use the company’s VPN to “move their laptop into the company network”, without the need to physically be there, so they have access to that information. In addition, network traffic sent over VPNs is generally encrypted, so even if the salesperson is using a maybe insecure network, the data is probably safe, if everything is configured correctly.</p>

<p>The VPNs that get advertised at the end of YouTube videos are different. They are not used to access protected, internal infrastructure. Instead, they are used to tunnel <em>all</em> network traffic into a datacenter you neither know nor can control in any way. To understand why this might be a bad idea and is absolutely not necessary in most cases, let’s look at the marketing claims.</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-is-used-for-tracking-and-leaks-private-information-you-should-hide-it">“Your IP is used for tracking and leaks private information. You should hide it.”</h2>

<p>One thing that most VPN advertisements have in common is some babble around IP addresses. Providers claim that your IP address leaks tons of private information, even your physical location, and they also claim that IP addresses are used for tracking. I call that fearmongering and deliberate misinformation.</p>

<p><img src="https://schub.wtf/statics/blog/20190408/vpn-check.jpg" alt="Two screenshots from VPN websites showing my &quot;unprotected&quot; IP address"></p>

<p>I am sure you have seen notices like these on VPN provider’s websites before. They claim that your IP can be used to track you, and they even show a map of where you are located to make it look scarier.</p>

<p>Before I address those two things, let me say something more generic. Notice how both sites show my IP, claim that my connection is “unprotected”, and one is even showing a map? Well. In reality, I am actually <em>using a VPN</em> in those screenshots, I just happened to use <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProtonVPN</a> for this example, so I should be protected very well, right? How come they claim I am unprotected?</p>

<p>That is because those “tests” do not do anything useful. The only check these things are doing is a simple “is the user currently connected via one of our IPs, and thus is using our VPN? If yes, say the user is protected, otherwise, act like the world is on fire”. Not very productive.</p>

<h3 id="ip-addresses-for-user-identification">IP addresses for user identification</h3>

<p>One of the sponsor messages I quoted earlier explicitly claims that IP addresses are how you “are being tracked online all the time by social media sites and marketing companies”. But is that so? We all know that Facebook is pretty big in the whole “tracking people” business, so if you have an active subscription at one of those VPN providers and a Facebook account, let’s do a test together!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a new Private Window/Incognito Window in your favorite browser.</li>
  <li>In that window, open two tabs: Facebook, and the “What is my IP?” page of your VPN provider, like <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/what-is-my-ip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from ExpressVPN</a>.</li>
  <li>Log in to your Facebook account.</li>
  <li>With the VPN disabled, verify that the “test” site shows “you are unprotected”, like in my screenshots above.</li>
  <li>Connect to your VPN. Refresh the VPN test page, which should now say that your IP is hidden and your connection is protected. Right?</li>
  <li>Now, switch over to the Facebook tab, and hit reload.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what happened? Did Facebook forget who you are, and boot you back out to the login form? No, of course not. Even though your IP address changed, Facebook still knew <em>exactly</em> who you are. So do marketing companies and other tracking parties.</p>

<p>The reality here is that your IP address is only a tiny piece of your trackable profile and a pretty unreliable one as such. Tracking companies are interested in tracking <em>you</em>, not a specific device or a specific browsing session. Your IP changes all the time, take your mobile phone as an example: You may be connected to your home WiFi, to your mobile connection, the network at work, … and you will have a different IP in each network. Moreover, these IPs are not even unique to you in most cases: most mobile phone networks share their public IPs to hundreds, sometimes thousands of mobile phones in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAT</a>. Tracking companies have to distinguish between all those people - their profiles would be useless otherwise.</p>

<p>Tracking companies have far more advanced methods. One well-known identification method is <em>Cookies</em>, little portions of data in your browser or mobile client. However, since Cookies can easily be altered or removed by users, trackers came up with far more advanced technologies like browser fingerprinting and even running behavioral pattern recognition to uniquely identify users. All these things cannot be influenced or altered in any way by a VPN.</p>

<p>If you are worried about these things, then use a browser with integrated tracking protection features. In Firefox, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/facebook-container-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-Account Containers and the Facebook Container Extension</a> for example help by locking those tracking sites into their isolated sandbox, so they cannot track you when you are not actively using them. The whole “a VPN makes you browse anonymously” thing is just marketing.</p>

<h3 id="location-leaking">Location leaking</h3>

<p>Another very effective method these VPN marketing people are using is showing your location on their sites. This is very effective at scaring people since those sites hit either your actual hometown or a city nearby. Nobody wants to share their location publicly.</p>

<p>“Your IP address” is not leaking your home address.</p>

<p>You see, your modem is not connected to a cable that leads directly to your ISPs main router. Instead, your internet data is <em>merged together</em> with other peoples data on the way. ISPs split up their network into multiple segments to make their network more manageable, …</p></section></section></div>

							<p>TL;DR: If you have a Zyxel USG, ATP, VPN, ZyWALL or USG FLEX you should update to the latest firmware version today. You can find the full list of affected devices <a href="https://businessforum.zyxel.com/discussion/5252/zld-v4-60-revoke-and-wk48-firmware-release">here</a> and the Zyxel advisory <a href="https://www.zyxel.com/support/CVE-2020-29583.shtml">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>Zyxel is a popular brand for firewalls that are marketed towards small and medium businesses. Their Unified Security Gateway (USG) product line is often used as a firewall or VPN gateway. As a lot of us are working from home, VPN-capable devices have been quite selling well lately.</p>
                            <p>When doing some research (rooting) on my Zyxel USG40, I was surprised to find a user account 'zyfwp' with a password hash in the latest firmware version (4.60 patch 0). The plaintext password was visible in one of the binaries on the system. I was even more surprised that this account seemed to work on both the SSH and web interface.</p>
                            <pre>$ ssh <a href="https://www.eyecontrol.nl/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4b31322d3c3b0b7a7279657a7d73657a65797e79">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
Password: Pr*******Xp
Router&gt; show users current
No: 1
  Name: zyfwp
  Type: admin
(...)
Router&gt;</pre>
                            <p>The user is not visible in the interface and its password cannot be changed. I checked the previous firmware version (4.39) and although the user was present, it did not have a password. It seemed the vulnerability had been introduced in the latest firmware version. Even though older versions do not have this vulnerability, they do have others (such as this <a href="https://www.zyxel.com/us/en/support/Zyxel-security-advisory-for-buffer-overflow-vulnerability.shtml">buffer overflow</a>) so you should still update.</p>
                            <p>As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface, a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar, I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally, more than 100.000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet.</p>
                            <p>In our experience, most users of these devices will not update the firmware very often. Zyxel devices do not expose their firmware version to unauthenticated users, so determining if a device is vulnerable is a bit more difficult. We wanted to get an idea of the amount of affected devices, but simply trying the password is not really an option (ethically and legally). Luckily, some javascript and css files can be requested from the web interface of these devices without authentication. These files seem to change with every firmware release. Using this information, we can obtain a unique fingerprint of the vulnerable firmware version. We used this information to identify the firmware version of 1.000 devices in The Netherlands and found that around 10% of devices are running the affected firmware version. Zyxel does offer automatic updates, but these are not enabled by default. Luckily, we were able to find this vulnerability just a few weeks after it had been introduced, or the number of affected devices could have been much larger.</p>
                            <p>As the zyfwp user has admin privileges, this is a serious vulnerability. An attacker could completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the device. Someone could for example change firewall settings to allow or block certain traffic. They could also intercept traffic or create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device.  Combined with a vulnerability like Zerologon this could be devastating to small and medium businesses.</p>
                            <p>Because of the seriousness of the vulnerability and it being so easy to exploit, we have decided not to release the password for this account at this time. We do expect others to find and release it, which is why we suggest you install the updated firmware as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>I quickly sent out a mail to Zyxel to report the undocumented user account. According to Zyxel, the account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates for access points via FTP. They released a fixed firmware version less than two weeks later. You can find the release notes for the USG40 <a href="ftp://ftp.zyxel.com/USG40/firmware/USG40_4.60(AALA.1)C0_2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>This is the entry in the release notes that describes this vulnerability:</p>

Thank you all!</p><p>I have a small request:</p><div><div><div> <h3>Share This On Twitter</h3><p>If you find this useful, please share on Twitter, thank you!</p></div></div></div><h2 id="whos-this-tutorial-for"><a href="#whos-this-tutorial-for" aria-label="whos this tutorial for permalink"></a>Who’s this tutorial for?</h2><p>This series of compiler tutorials is for people who don’t just want to create a <em>toy</em> language.
You want objects. You want polymorphism. You want concurrency. You want garbage collection. Wait you don’t want GC? Okay, no worries, we won’t do that :P</p><p>If you’ve just joined the series at this stage, here’s a quick recap. We’re designing a Java-esque concurrent object-oriented programming language <em>Bolt</em>. We’ve gone through the compiler frontend, where we’ve done the parsing, type-checking and dataflow analysis. We’ve <a href="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/lower-language-constructs-to-llvm/">desugared our language to get it ready for LLVM</a> - the main takeaway is that objects have been desugared to structs, and their methods desugared to functions.</p><p>Learn about LLVM and you’ll be the envy of your friends. Rust uses LLVM for its backend, so it must be cool. You’ll beat them on all those performance benchmarks, without having to hand-optimise your code or write machine assembly code. Shhhh, I won’t tell them.</p><h2 id="just-give-me-the-code"><a href="#just-give-me-the-code" aria-label="just give me the code permalink"></a>Just give me the code!</h2><p>All the code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt">Bolt compiler repository</a>.</p><p>The C++ class definitions for our desugared representation (we call this <em>Bolt IR</em>) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/deserialise_ir">deserialise_ir</a> folder. The code for this post (the LLVM IR generation) can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/llvm_ir_codegen">llvm_ir_codegen</a> folder. The repo uses the Visitor design pattern and ample use of <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to make memory management easier.</p><p>To cut through the boilerplate, to find out how to generate LLVM IR for a particular language expression, search for the <code>IRCodegenVisitor::codegen</code> method that takes in the corresponding <code>ExprIR</code> object. e.g. for if-else statements:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>Value </span><span>*</span><span>IRCodegenVisitor</span><span>::</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprIfElseIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="understanding-llvm-ir"><a href="#understanding-llvm-ir" aria-label="understanding llvm ir permalink"></a>Understanding LLVM IR</h2><p>LLVM sits in the <strong>middle-end</strong> of our compiler, <em>after</em> we’ve desugared our language features, but <em>before</em> the backends that target specific machine architectures (x86, ARM etc.)</p><p>LLVM’s IR is pretty low-level, it can’t contain language features present in some languages but not others (e.g. classes are present in C++ but not C). If you’ve come across instruction sets before, LLVM IR is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer#:~:text=A%20reduced%20instruction%20set%20computer,instruction%20set%20computer%20(CISC).">RISC</a> instruction set.</p><p>The upshot of it is that LLVM IR looks like a more <em>readable</em> form of assembly. As LLVM IR is <strong>machine independent</strong>, we don’t need to worry about the number of registers, size of datatypes, calling conventions or other machine-specific details.</p><p>So instead of a fixed number of physical registers, in LLVM IR we have an unlimited set of <em>virtual</em> registers (labelled <code>%0</code>, <code>%1</code>, <code>%2</code>, <code>%3</code>… we can write and read from. It’s the backend’s job to map from virtual to physical registers.</p><p>And rather than allocating specific sizes of datatypes, we retain <strong>types</strong> in LLVM IR. Again, the backend will take this type information and map it to the size of the datatype. LLVM has types for different sizes of <code>int</code>s and floats, e.g. <code>int32</code>, <code>int8</code>, <code>int1</code> etc. It also has derived types: like <strong>pointer</strong> types, <strong>array</strong> types, <strong>struct</strong> types, <strong>function</strong> types. To find out more, check out the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Type.html">Type</a> documentation.</p><p>Now, built into LLVM are a set of optimisations we can run over the LLVM IR e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination">dead-code elimination</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function inlining</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rco/vignettes/opt-common-subexpr.html">common subexpression elimination</a> etc. The details of these algorithms are irrelevant: LLVM implements them for us.</p><p>Our side of the bargain is that we write LLVM IR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static Single Assignment (SSA) form</a>, as SSA form makes life easier for optimisation writers. SSA form sounds fancy, but it just means we define variables before use and assign to variables <strong>only once</strong>. In SSA form, we cannot reassign to a variable, e.g. <code>x = x+1</code>; instead we assign to a fresh variable each time (<code>x2 = x1 + 1</code>).</p><p>So in short: LLVM IR looks like assembly with <strong>types</strong>, minus the messy machine-specific details. LLVM IR must be in SSA form, which makes it easier to optimise. Let’s look at an example!</p><h3 id="an-example-factorial"><a href="#an-example-factorial" aria-label="an example factorial permalink"></a>An example: Factorial</h3><p>Let’s look at a simple factorial function in our language Bolt:</p><div><p><span>factorial.bolt</span></p><div><pre><p><span>function </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> n</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>==</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>else</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    n </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>The corresponding LLVM IR is as follows:</p><div><p><span>factorial.ll</span></p><div><pre><p><span>define i32 @</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>entry</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>eq </span><span>=</span><span> icmp eq i32 </span><span>%</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>   </span><span></span></p><p><span>  br i1 </span><span>%</span><span>eq</span><span>,</span><span> label </span><span>%</span><span>then</span><span>,</span><span> label </span><span>%</span><span>else</span><span></span></p><p><span>then</span><span>:</span><span>                                             </span><span>;</span><span> preds </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>entry</span></p><p><span>  br label </span><span>%</span><span>ifcont</span></p><p><span></span><span>else</span><span>:</span><span>                                             </span><span>;</span><span> preds </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>entry</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>sub </span><span>=</span><span> sub i32 </span><span>%</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>   </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> call i32 @</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>i32 </span><span>%</span><span>sub</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>mult </span><span>=</span><span> mul i32 </span><span>%</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>  br label </span><span>%</span><span>ifcont</span></p><p><span>ifcont</span><span>:</span><span>                                           </span><span>;</span><span> preds </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>else</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>then</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>iftmp </span><span>=</span><span> phi i32 </span><span>[</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>then </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>mult</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ret i32 </span><span>%</span><span>iftmp</span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Note the <code>.ll</code> extension is for <strong>human-readable</strong> LLVM IR output.

In the Bolt repo, I chose to make this namespacing explicit by referring to them as <code>llvm::Value</code>, <code>llvm::Module</code> etc.)</p><p>Most of the LLVM API is quite mechanical. Now you’ve seen the diagrams that define modules, functions and basic blocks, the relationship between their corresponding classes in the API falls out nicely.

It is estimated that by 2050, antibiotic-resistant infections could claim 10 million lives each year and impose a cumulative $100 trillion burden on the global economy. The list of bacteria that are becoming resistant to treatment with all available antibiotic options is growing and few new drugs are in the pipeline, creating a pressing need for new classes of antibiotics to prevent public health crises. </p><p>“We took a creative, double-pronged strategy to develop new molecules that can kill difficult-to-treat infections while enhancing the natural host immune response,” said <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwistar.org%2Four-scientists%2Ffarokh-dotiwala&amp;t=YjNjYWFiNWFhZDVjYzUyMjEyYTE4NDU2ZDBkNDBlZGM4ZGJhZjAwNyx2TVBmZ0tzTg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638507012246962176%2Fnovel-antibiotics-class&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609175174">Farokh Dotiwala, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, assistant professor in the Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center and lead author of the effort to identify a new generation of antimicrobials named dual-acting immuno-antibiotics (DAIAs). </p><p>Existing antibiotics target essential bacterial functions, including nucleic acid and protein synthesis, building of the cell membrane, and metabolic pathways. However, bacteria can acquire drug resistance by mutating the bacterial target the antibiotic is directed against, inactivating the drugs or pumping them out. </p><p>“We reasoned that harnessing the immune system to simultaneously attack bacteria on two different fronts makes it hard for them to develop resistance,” said Dotiwala.</p><p>He and colleagues focused on a metabolic pathway that is essential for most bacteria but absent in humans, making it an ideal target for antibiotic development. This pathway, called methyl-D-erythritol phosphate (MEP) or non-mevalonate pathway, is responsible for biosynthesis of isoprenoids — molecules required for cell survival in most pathogenic bacteria. The lab targeted the IspH enzyme, an essential enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis, as a way to block this pathway and kill the microbes. Given the broad presence of IspH in the bacterial world, this approach may target a wide range of bacteria. </p><p>Researchers used computer modeling to screen several million commercially available compounds for their ability to bind with the enzyme, and selected the most potent ones that inhibited IspH function as starting points for drug discovery.</p><p>Since previously available IspH inhibitors could not penetrate the bacterial cell wall, Dotiwala collaborated with Wistar’s medicinal chemist <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwistar.org%2Four-scientists%2Fjoseph-salvino&amp;t=NjIwMjBhNWI3YTQxOTJkNjMyZTg5OWViNWI2MzQwMTgzNDQyMWFkNix2TVBmZ0tzTg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638507012246962176%2Fnovel-antibiotics-class&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609175174">Joseph Salvino, Ph.D.</a>, professor in The Wistar Institute Cancer Center and a co-senior author on the study, to identify and synthesize novel IspH inhibitor molecules that were able to get inside the bacteria.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1161"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7ded80bcfb9d5c7a58928160401c0658/a64f4c2145ca1551-72/s1280x1920/8825881c16af26c9d1608fc30a8f0c54ceae4885.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1161" width="1280" height="1032"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Flourescence microscopy staining showing the effects of DAIA treatment on bacteria viability.

In preclinical models of gram negative bacterial infection, the bactericidal effects of the IspH inhibitors outperformed traditional pan antibiotics. All compounds tested were shown to be nontoxic to human cells. </p><p>“Immune activation represents the second line of attack of the DAIA strategy,” said Kumar Singh, Ph.D., Dotiwala lab postdoctoral fellow and first author of the study. </p><p>“We believe this innovative DAIA strategy may represent a potential landmark in the world’s fight against AMR, creating a synergy between the direct killing ability of antibiotics and the natural power of the immune system,” echoed Dotiwala. </p><p><b>Co-authors:</b> Rishabh Sharma, Poli Adi Narayana Reddy, Prashanthi Vonteddu, Madeline Good, Anjana Sundarrajan, Hyeree Choi, Kar Muthumani, Andrew Kossenkov, Aaron R.

<p>The Raspberry Pi family of devices is a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They are all based on Broadcom System-on-a-chip (SOCs). 
</p>


<h2><span id="Status"></span>Status</h2>
<p>Only the <i>Raspberry Pi 3 Family</i> is supported upstream, with the AArch64 effort.
</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 4B is not <em>supported</em> by NixOS, though a beta-quality disk image specific for it is produced. It will be supported the same as the Pi 3 family once the mainline kernel and mainline U-Boot boot fine through the generic mainline image.
</p><p>Other Raspberry Pis (0, 1, and 2) are part of diverse community porting efforts to ARMv6 and ARMv7.
</p><p>The Linux kernel in use, except for the Raspberry Pi 1 family, is the mainline Linux kernel, and not the Raspberry Pi Foundation's fork. This could reduce compatibility with some add-on boards or third-party libraries<sup>[expanded explanation needed]</sup>.
</p><p>The following table is intended to be updated by the NixOS contributors with the current status of the boards. For a list of products, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/">see the <i>Products Archive</i></a>.

<p>The custom bootloader, part of the Raspberry Pi firmware, is abstracted away for NixOS by making it boot U-Boot instead.
</p><p>U-Boot gives us the ability to provide a generation selection menu during the boot process, in addition to storing the boot files on the main partition, rather than on the firmware partition.

</p>
<h2><span id="Troubleshooting"></span>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3><span id="Power_issues"></span>Power issues</h3>
<p>Especially with the newer power-hungry Raspberry Pi families (3, 4), it is important to have a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md">sufficient enough power supply</a> or <i>weirdness</i> may happen. Weirdness may include:
</p>
<ul><li> Lightning bolt on HDMI output "breaking" the display.</li>
<li> Screen switching back to u-boot text
<ul><li> Fixable temporarily when power is sufficient by switching VT (alt+F2 / alt+F1)</li></ul></li>
<li> Random hangs</li></ul>
<p>This problem is a hard problem. It is caused by the Raspberry Pi warning about power issues, but the current drivers (as of 
Linux 4.14) have a hard time dealing with it properly. If the power supply is rated properly AND the cable is not incurring too much power losses, it may be required to disable the lightning bolt indicator so the display driver isn't messed up.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The lightning bolt indicator can be disabled by adding the line <code>avoid_warnings=1</code> in config.txt<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p><strong> Note: </strong>A <i>properly rated</i> USB power supply, AND a good cable are necessary. The cable has to be short enough to not incur power losses through the length. Do note that thin and cheap cables usually have thinner copper wires, which in turn accentuates power losses.</p>

<h3> Understanding Calculus </h3>
<p>
Understanding Calculus is a complete online introductory book that focuses on 
concepts. Integrated throughout the e-book are many engineering 
applications aimed at developing the student's scientific approach towards problem 
solving. 


</p><p> The book has as much to do with calculus as with philosophy. My
motivation in writing it was to prove to myself that I could understand
a complex subject like calculus by applying simple rules
of logic and reason. As Henry Ford said, " Nothing is particularly 
hard if you divide it
into small jobs ".  Too much of the world is
complicated by layers of evolution. If you understand how each layer is
put down then you can begin to understand the complex systems that
govern our world. 


Charles Darwin wrote in 1859 in his 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Species" target="new">
On The Origin of Species</a>,

</p><blockquote>
<i>

" When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a
ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard
every production of nature as one which had a history; when we
contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of
many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same as
when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing of the
labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous
workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting,
I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become! "</i>
</blockquote>

<p> Darwin's words are equally applicable to art as well as science.
Every artist's performance requires a great deal of craft. Even
stand-up comedy is not a question of going on stage and saying funny things.
There is an enormous amount of work, practice and thought that would
have to go into it. 	


</p><p> My advice to students is to find something that
fascinates you. As Physics Nobel Laureate 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="new">
Richard Feynman</a>
 said, " Study hard
what interests you the most in the most undisciplined and
original manner possible." The price for seeking understanding is that one must be
willing to tolerate ambiguities and accept one's own ignorance. Feynman
said, " I can live with doubt and uncertainty. I think it is much more
interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be
wrong."

</p><p>


I hope you find the book enlightening as the goal is to learn by
understanding, not by memorizing.

<p>
I've always enjoyed terse programs that show how things work
<i>without</i> magic hiding incidental complexity. After realizing that my
initial attempt at a neural net only cost <span>less than 200 lines of Rust</span>,
I decided to take a snapshot and write about building it before I go
on and extend (and possibly over-complicate or abandon) the system.
</p>

<p>
More than anything else, treat this as encouragement to write your own
neural network – the core implementation turned out to be
surprisingly compact – enough to encourage me to write about it.
</p>

<p>
<b>This is not an introduction to neural nets</b>: There are several excellent
resources already available online that can describe the underlying
math and structure of networks; I'll just talk through them enough to
explain the structure of the code.
</p>

<p>
It's also entirely likely that I have mistakes in here; this was
written quickly with the main <b>aim</b> of encouraging more people to write
their own nets from scratch – and given one simple point for
comparison. If you do write your own, please share it with me!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd2852bf">
<h2 id="orgd2852bf">Choosing a simple problem &amp; architecture</h2>
<div id="text-orgd2852bf">
<p>
Achieving SotA on MNIST is an explicit non-goal: this project is aimed
at exploring the mechanics of a neural network, and being able to play
around with it while changing one feature at a time.
</p>

<p>
Instead of trying to see if the network can accurately predict results
from data I can't understand or reason about, I'm going to have the
network try to behave like a simple continuous function of my choice
instead – I'll play with different functions like \(y=x^2\), \(y=x^3\),
\(y=x * sin(x)\), etc.
</p>

<p>
This greatly simplifies some parts of the network – there's a single
input, and single output. The <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html">Universality Theorem</a> suggests that I
should be able to get fairly far with a single layer, so that's where
I'm starting.
</p>

<p>
I like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning">ReLU</a> and leaky ReLU because of their simplicity, and I'll stick
with them here – though I don't have any strong justification about
the choice of activation function yet.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4236674">
<h2 id="org4236674">Building the network</h2>

<div id="outline-container-orgcfce027">
<h3 id="orgcfce027">Storing a network</h3>
<div id="text-orgcfce027">
<p>
The very first decision was figuring out how to store the neural
network – my very first attempt at doing this involved a lot of pure
functions and state being passed around all over the place which
quickly became messy – it was much more maintainable to have a single
place to represent a neural network.
</p>



<p>
Happily enough, with the decision to have a single input and output, a
single hidden layer means that there are only so many weights I need
to store. 
</p>

<p>
The overall structure is fairly simple:
</p>
<pre>
    o
  /   \
x - o  - y
  .   .
   . .
    o 

</pre>

<p>
Before drawing in the calculations that need to happen, I'm going to
introduce a system for indexing nodes which should make this much
easier to talk about and parse:
</p>
<pre>
          Layer -&gt;
   +-------------------------&gt;
   |    
N  |               0       1
e  |               |       |
u  |          0 -  o       .
r  |       /         \     .
o  | 0 - x -  1 -  o - 0 - y
n  |       .         .
|  |        .       .
v  |         ns -  o
   v               

</pre>

<p>
It's a fairly simple system for drawing neurons – a layer index that
starts at the first hidden layer; and a per-layer index into the
neuron itself.
</p>

<p>
For each <b>weight</b> in the system, there are going to be 3 coordinates:
the neuron it's at, and then the <i>input</i> it's specified for – this is a
little bit different than most online courses, because I'm <i>not</i>
directly using vectors to be very explicit about the underlying
calculations (both avoiding matrix calculations and paying the price
in terms of speed as the price).
</p>

<p>
Drawing in the calculations for evaluating the network forward to make
this a little bit more concrete:
</p>

<pre>         0    1
         |    |                   layer input   
                                    |     |
     0 - o &lt;------- n[0,0] = relu(w[0, 0, 0]x + b[0, 0, 0])
  /        \                           |
x -  1 - o -  y                      neuron   
  .        .   \
   .      .     relu(sum(w[1, x, i]*n[0, i] + b[1, x, i]))
    ns - o

</pre>

<p>
I also have somewhat stronger constraints on the potential values for
my indexes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>for layer = 0
<ul>
<li>the neuron's index can go from 0 -&gt; <code>ns</code> (number of neurons)</li>
<li>the input can only be 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li>for layer = 1
<ul>
<li>the neuron's index can only be 0 (just one output)</li>
<li>and the input can go from 0 -&gt; ns (# of neurons in previous layer)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
In the code, I often refer to the <code>[layer, neuron, input]</code> index as <code>[x,
y, z]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Having this written out explicitly helped me a lot in implementing the
network, and I hope the constraints should make sense to you given the
structure of the network.
</p>

<p>
Finally, instead of dealing with initializing and taking care of
multi-dimensional vectors or arrays, I'm going to use a trick I often
rely on in Advent of Code for complex grid structures and keep a
single vector – with a function to translate my custom indexing
system into offsets.

<p>
Starting the network with all weights initialized to 0 is a good way
to get stuck with 0 gradients during gradient descent: and a good
experiment to run while running the code yourself.
</p>

<p>
For this first iteration, I'm hard coding random initialization of
weights into the program – but I'll expose another function that
accepts custom initial weights in the next iteration for exploration.

<p>
Up next is evaluating the value predicted by the network at a single
point, which is a straight forward traversal through the network. I'm
going to use a leaky ReLU as my activation function, so I'll quickly
define it:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>relu</span>(<span>v</span>: <span>f64</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
    <span>if</span> v &gt;= 0.0 {
        v
    } <span>else</span> {
        0.01 * v
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
First, I'm going to throw in several utility functions to access or
calculate values in different parts of the net – in my first
implementation, I extracted these out after implementing back-prop,
but there's no harm in putting them up here first.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Net</span> {

    <span>/// Relu(w * input + b) for coordinates x, y, z with input val</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>rwxb</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>val</span>: <span>f64</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        relu(<span>self</span>.wxb(val, x, y, z))
    }

    <span>/// w * input + b for coordinates x, y, z with input val</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>wxb</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>val</span>: <span>f64</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        <span>self</span>.w(x, y, z) * val + <span>self</span>.b(x, y, z)
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>w</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        <span>self</span>.ws[<span>self</span>.pt(x, y, z)]
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>b</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        <span>self</span>.bs[<span>self</span>.pt(x, y, z)]
    }

}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Iterating through the net and calculating values lends itself
comfortably to Rust's beautiful iterator/expression based system:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Net</span> {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>eval</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>val</span>: <span>f64</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        relu(
            (0..<span>self</span>.ns)
                .map(|i| <span>self</span>.rwxb(<span>self</span>.rwxb(val, 0, i, 0), 1, 0, i))
                .sum(),
        )
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you look at the diagram, I need to calculate the values of the
individual neurons – \(Relu(w * x + b)\) – which can be expressed as
<code>rwxb(x, 0, i, 0)</code> with <code>x</code> as the input and <code>i</code> ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>ns</code>
(number of neurons).
</p>

<p>
Then, the value of y is the value of these neurons as inputs added up,
and passed through Relu <i>again</i>. Which  is exactly what the function
above does.
</p>

<p>
(I admit to messing up the naming convention a little bit with x
playing double duty as both the input and the first coordinate; I'll
try to clean this up later if I find anyone actually reading this post.)

<p>
Keeping loss as simple as possible, I'm simply calculating it as \((y -
y')^2\) at a data point. The <i>cost</i>, or loss across a given set of data
is then the average of the total loss. The implementation is as
straightforward as you would expect, given data in the form of tuples.
</p>

<p>
This is yet another decision to play around with in the future with
alternative functions.
</p>

<div>

<p>As we’ve been doing lately, last weekend we observed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> orbiter at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Telescope_Array">Allen Telescope Array</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a> community activities in the telescope. This post contains a large overview of these observations, including the efforts to determine the spacecraft orbit, the study of the signal polarization, and the data obtained by decoding the telemetry.</p>



<p>I am still transferring the IQ data from the telescope, but I will publish the recordings in <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> in a few days and update this post.</p>



<h4>Orbit</h4>



<p>On December 16, the orbiter did an Earth fly by, avoiding reentry and dropping the capsule containing the lunar samples. The fate of the orbiter was unknown at that time, but there were words that it had plenty of spare fuel and an extended mission was being planned.</p>



<p>Amateur observers such as <a href="https://twitter.com/df2mz">Edgar Kaiser DF2MZ</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a> were able to <a href="https://twitter.com/df2mz/status/1339490142206234624">detect</a> the orbiter’s <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1339603055164067843">telemetry signals</a> on December 17, confirming that the spacecraft was still in space. However, its new orbit wasn’t know. Scott, <a href="https://twitter.com/Astrogator_Mike">Mike Loucks</a> and <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/">Bill Gray</a> set to try to determine the orbit.</p>



<p>The initial data <a href="https://twitter.com/Astrogator_Mike/status/1339857762482671617">suggested</a> an elliptical orbit with apogee at the Moon’s orbit, so that in three revolutions a Moon flyby could be performed to send the orbiter somewhere else. Observations with the ATA are of large help for this, because the 6.1 metre dishes have a rather narrow beamwidth at 8.4 GHz, so dish pointing data from ATA tends to be accurate to within 0.2 degrees, which is much better than what can be achieved with the smaller dishes of Amateur stations.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the narrow beamwidth of ATA makes it more difficult to find the signal, since even a small error in pointing will make it disappear completely in the noise. On Saturday 19 I used the pointing data from Edgar as a starting point for my search and managed to locate the spacecraft after some 45 minutes of manual search.</p>



<p>On Sunday 20 I wasn’t so lucky. I used the orbit that Bill had estimated as my initial search location, and after searching for a while manually, I decided to automate the search by slowly sweeping a small area of the sky to produce a signal intensity map. I started at the point predicted by Bill’s orbit and continued outwards, sweeping an ever increasing circular patch of the sky.</p>



<p>The resulting map can be seen below. Each of the squares in the image corresponds to 0.2 x 0.2 degrees and takes several seconds to generate, including 3 seconds of integration and the time that it takes to command and move the dish. In fact, this image took one hour and 15 minutes to generate.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find.png"><img width="590" height="567" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find.png 590w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find-300x288.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"></a></figure>



<p>We can already see the signal leaking in at the upper left border of the scanned circle, so at that point I decided to stop this search and start a new one centred at that point with the objective of fine tuning the signal location.</p>



<p>The resulting image is below. Here we clearly locate the spacecraft’s signal to one particular point of the sky. Note the change in the colour map range between this image and the previous one.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2.png"><img width="597" height="561" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2.png 597w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"></a></figure>



<p>As it turns out, the real position of the spacecraft was more than one degree away from my initial search location (which was taken from Bill’s orbit). The reason for this is that our initial ideas for the orbit were wrong. After including this new pointing data in his orbit solution, Bill noticed that the orbit’s apogee was much larger than we thought. In fact, the spacecraft was already on a direct path to the Sun-Earth L1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point">Lagrange point</a>. An official statement of this fact <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4584346742690791?">appeared in the news</a> more or less at the same time we realized this.</p>



<p>Still, our orbit estimate is far from perfect and has to be refined using further pointing and Doppler data. One of the main questions is whether the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_(astronomy)">elongation</a> and inclination is correct for a direct route to L1 or whether it will just go nearby L1.</p>



<p>The figure below shows a simulation in <a href="http://gmat.sourceforge.net/docs/">GMAT</a> using some preliminary orbit data. We see that the spacecraft lags 45 degrees behind the L1 point until April 2021, when it starts being ejected slowly. It may happen that this is already good enough to wait until the appropriate moment to hop to a near-Earth asteroid, which seems the most likely science target, or that small corrections can keep the spacecraft hovering around L1 for longer or nudge it closer to it.</p>

<p>The orbit data used in the image above was taken from <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/temp/ch5.htm">Bill’s pseudo-MPEC</a> from Dec 20 21:46:31 UT, which gives the following state vector in GMAT.</p>

<h4>Polarization and signal strength</h4>



<p>Both on Saturday 19 and Sunday 20 the spacecraft signals were recorded during the full pass, until the spacecraft was lost below the 16.8 degree minimum elevation for tracking. On the 20th a lot of time was lost searching for the signal, so the recording starts some two hours late.</p>



<p>As usual, the signal at 8471.2 MHz was strong. The second orbiter signal at 8486.2 MHz was also present, but it was much weaker, so telemetry could only be decoded from 8471.2 MHz. However, an initial study of the Doppler from these two signals shows that the 8486.2 MHz signal drifts much less. This is probably caused by the two transmitters being in different locations, with the 8486.2 MHz transmitter at a more thermally stable position, perhaps shaded from the Sun. Thus, even if weaker, the 8486.2 MHz signal can give us more accurate Doppler data.</p>



<p>The figures below show the waterfall for the 8471.2 MHz and 8486.2 MHz signals for December 19. We can see a large increase in the noise floor around 17:00 UTC. I’m not sure of the cause of this, but I suspect ground noise entering through some of the dish sidelobes. We see that the signal is not in ground lock, since the idle telecommand signal being looped back at +/- 8 kHz from the main carrier is missing. The data sidebands are clearly visible in the 8471.2 MHz signal and almost in the noise in the 8486.2 MHz.</p>

<p>The waterfalls for December 20 are very similar. There is no noise hump, but the recording starts after 17:00 UTC. The sky track was quite similar on both days, so if the noise increase happens at a particular azimuth and elevation, then we would have missed it because of the late start on the 20th.</p>

<p>The signal strength (Stokes \(I\)) is shown in the plots below. The wiggles are an artefact caused by how the measurement is made (scalloping loss in the FFT). The measurement is signal plus noise of the main carrier, rather than just signal, so the measurement of the weak carrier 8486.2 MHz is not accurate.</p>



<p>The small jumps in the traces correspond to the moments when I tried to move the pointing slightly to improve the signal. Any variations seen here should not be taken too seriously, since they can be caused by a the pointing not being very good, rather than a real change in signal strength.</p>

<p>The polarized fraction (Stokes \(P/I = \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2 + V^2}/I\)) shows the degradation caused when unpolarized noise is included in the measurement for the weaker SNRs. For the weak 8486.2 MHz carrier we see that, in the measurement bandwidth, 50% or more of the power is unpolarized noise. Therefore, to normalize the Stokes \(L = Q + iU\) and \(V\) I have decided to divide by \(P\) rather than \(I\) as I was doing in <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/12/change-5-reception-from-ata-on-its-return-trajectory-polarization/" data-type="post" data-id="9400">previous polarization studies of Chang’e 5</a>.</p>

<p>The plots below show Stokes \(V/P\), which indicates the circular polarization fraction and handedness. As in the previous weekend we see that the signal at 8471.2 MHz has almost ideal RHCP. This makes sense, because this should be the antenna that is pointing directly to Earth. The signal from 8486.2 MHz is seen with elliptic polarization, since it is probably pointing in a different direction.</p>



<p>On the 20th we see a decrease in the Stokes \(V\) of the 8471.2 MHz signal. This, together with the decrease in signal strength may be caused by a dish pointing error, but it could indicate that the spacecraft’s antenna is slowly moving away from Earth. In fact, since the Chinese are probably not going to monitor the spacecraft so often during the long trip to L1 (as evidenced by the lack of a ground lock seen in these observations), it is not so important that one of the antennas is kept pointing to Earth.</p>

<p>The two figures below show the relative strength and angle of the linear polarization on December 19th. Something weird happens with the polarization angle of the 8471.2 MHz signal around 17:00 UTC, but otherwise both signals show a slow increase in the angle throughout the observation. Note that this data is not corrected for parallactic angle rotation.</p>

<p>On December 20th we see a similar slow increase in the polarization angle throughout the observation. We also see a noticeable increase in the fractional linear polarization of the 8471.2 MHz signal, which matches the decrease in Stokes \(V\) we saw above.</p>

<p>The Jupyter notebooks used to produce these plots can be found <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_notebooks/blob/main/CE5/Polarization%202020-12-19.ipynb">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_notebooks/blob/main/CE5/Polarization%202020-12-20.ipynb">here</a>.</p>



<h4>Telemetry</h4>



<p>The telemetry decoded from the 8471.2 MHz signal contains, as usual, CCSDS AOS frames using virtual channel 1 for real time telemetry. I have analysed it in a <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis%20ATA%202020-12-19.ipynb">Jupyter notebook for 2020-12-19</a> and <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis%20ATA%202020-12-20.ipynb">another one for 2020-12-20</a>.</p>



<p>The decoded frames and frame loss for Saturday 19 are shown below. The decoding is quite good, except for a short interval around 17:00 UTC when the noise level rose higher and the signal became a bit weaker.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss.png"><img width="606" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss.png 606w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"></a></figure>



<p>The frames decoded on Sunday 20 do not have any gaps, but during the last hour of the observation we have some frame loss, since the signal was a bit weaker.</p>

</figure><h3><strong>Dead Alien Civilization </strong></h3><p>The researchers behind this study, Xiang Cai, Jonathan H. Jiang, Kristen A. Fahy, and Yuk L. Yung, explained in the paper that "if intelligent life is likely to destroy themselves, it is not surprising that there is little or no intelligent life elsewhere".</p><p>If people are wondering why humans, the most intelligent living being on planet Earth and on the solar system, might still be alive, it is because the species are billions of years behind these now-extinct alien civilizations. The intelligent species or aliens probably noticed life form around eight billion years after the formation of the Milky Way, whereas humans did not reach until 13.5 billion years after the creation. This means the humans are almost over five billion years behind.</p><p>According to Jiang, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory astrophysicist, since Carl Sagan's time, there has been lots of research on alien life, especially when the Hubble Space Telescope and Kepler Space Telescope were created. "We have lots of knowledge about the densities in the Milky Way galaxy and star formation rates and exoplanet formation...and the occurrence rate of supernova explosions. We actually know some of the numbers," he <a href="https://www.livescience.com/milky-way-alien-life-map.html" rel="nofollow">added</a>.</p>

</figure><p>The numbers are actually related to the mystery variables that the American astronomer and the planetary scientist Segan referred to in his Cosmos miniseries in which he discussed the Drake equation. This formula proposed by American astrophysicist Frank Drake estimates N, the number of transmitting societies in the Milky Way galaxy. It is actually the equation that may give the scientists an idea about how many alien societies exist and are detectable.</p><p>Because of the scientific limitations at that time, Drake and Sagan included variables that could not be identified more precisely. But now Jiang and the team of scientists have learned about some of those numbers which Drake and Segan failed to identify. The paper says when and where life is most likely to flourish in the Milky Way and it identifies the most important factor affecting its prevalence that is intelligent creatures' tendency toward self-annihilation.</p><p>Understanding the factors helped the team of scientists believe that advanced alien civilizations did exist at one point in the galaxy, but they likely destroyed themselves by way of progress. However, according to some scientific theories, there might be <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/there-might-be-36-alien-races-in-the-milky-way" rel="nofollow">36</a> extraterrestrial races among the stars.</p><p>Earlier in 2018, scientists claimed that the galaxy used to be the home to aliens but it was the effect of climate change that vanished all the life forms, as per a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2018/12/31/galaxy-may-be-littered-with-dead-aliens-blindsided-by-natural-climate-change/?sh=497bde101955" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> from Forbes. In the recently released paper, the researchers said, "The simulated age distributions also suggest that most of the intelligent life in our galaxy are young, thus making observation or detection difficult."</p><p>They also found that even if the galaxy reached its civilizational peak over five billion years ago, most of the civilizations that were around that time have likely self-annihilated. However, the paper has been submitted to a journal for publication and it is currently awaiting peer review.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The following is a post which I found on the Blind app. It covers all the preparation and experiences of someone who received multiple job offers from the best tech companies, including multiple offers in the range of $550,000/year.</p>



<p>Because it can only be accessed via the app, I have copied it in its entirety here, so others can benefit from it. In order to respect the anonymity of the poster, I have not included their name. If you are the poster and wish to be credited, please contact me and I’ll update this article.</p>



<hr>



<p>I learnt a lot about interviews from blind community. This is my effort to give back to the community. This thread is not about TC, but for the curious ones, I have multiple offers around 550k and I still negotiating, I will start another thread with comp details.</p>



<p>Offers I got – Facebook (E6), Uber (5b), Oracle (IC5), Google (L5), Lyft (L5), Pinterest (L5), Cruise (Sr SDE 2), Compass (Staff), Convoy (Staff)</p>



<p>Where I failed – Airbnb (Onsite), Netflix (Phone screen), Dropbox (PS)</p>



<p>I am SDE3 in Amazon and YoE: 11 and TC: 355k.</p>



<p>My interview preparation –</p>



<h2>Algo and Coding</h2>



<p>I started with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CodeSignal (opens in a new tab)" href="https://codesignal.com/" target="_blank">CodeSignal</a>. This helped me to kick start the coding prep. After solving 2-3 problems on each topic, I moved onto Leetcode. On Leetcode, I started solving “Top interview questions”, after solving 50+ questions, I started mock interviews on <a href="http://interviewing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Interviewing.io (opens in a new tab)">Interviewing.io</a>, I failed the first 2 but I learned from my failures. I succeeded in the next 2 interviews and started attending onsite interviews of companies that I don’t mind failing. As of now, I completed 120 questions on Leetcode, Easy/Medium/Hard ratio is 30/75/15.</p>



<p>For Staff and higher level interviews, System design and Behavioral/experience interviews play very important role. Hiring panel assesses your level based your interview perf in these interviews.</p>



<h2>System design</h2>



<p>I reviewed all the designs in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Grokking the System Design Interview (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.educative.io/" target="_blank">Grokking the System Design Interview</a> and watched most of the system design videos in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this YouTube playlist (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhUQe4BKZXs&amp;list=PLkQkbY7JNJuBoTemzQfjym0sqbOHt5fnV" target="_blank">this YouTube playlist</a> and read this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Primer on System Design (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer" target="_blank">Primer on System Design</a>.</p>



<p>In Amazon I used various AWS applications like Dynamo, S3, SQS, SWF etc and I also watched design videos of these services. That also helped me in doing well in these interviews.</p>



<p>My approach for system design interview – </p>



<p>3-5 mins: Clarify requirements and define functional and non-functional (scaling and perf) requirements</p>



<p>5-10 mins: Define APIs including input and output params. Discuss about data model (primary key, 2ndary key etc)</p>



<p>10-15 mins: Define higher level architecture. Talk about various components in the overall architecture, Web client, Load balancer, Application servers, Data bases etc. Take couple of APIs and talk about end to end data flow from user to the storage. Talk about performance issues and how caching can help (sometimes caching is a bad thing). </p>



<p>15-20 mins: Talk about critical use case(s) that is specific to the given problem. For twitter it is about fanning out updates and handling celebrity update issue, for messaging apps it will be maintaining device connection status and taking care of offline use case and read/unread status etc.</p>



<p>If there is more time, discuss about scaling bottlenecks and discuss about how to address those issues. Talk about failures and how do you handle failures (retries, exponential back off etc)</p>



<h2>Behavioral and experience interviews</h2>



<p>In behavioral interviews, interviewers expect you to answer following, be prepare with convincing examples from your past experience.</p>



<p>* Tell me about a recent project which was very challenging, explain the challenge and tell me how you went about solving it?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a project where you had to work with cross functional teams and had difficulty in managing the expectation from one of those teams? How did you handle such scenario?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a scenario where you had a conflict with senior/junior in your team, how did you resolve this?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a scenario where you couldn’t meet your commitments on a project, what was the situation and impact? how did you handle the situation?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a scenario where you discovered an issue in your design in the middle of the project and how do you went about resolving it?</p>



<p>* What is your process of project prioritization? What do you do, if in the middle of the project requirement changes?</p>



<h2>Some tips</h2>



<p>* I was very nervous before my first onsite as I appeared for an interview after long time. It went well. That game me lot of confidence.</p>



<p>* Treat the interviewer as a peer and have an open discussion in design interviews. When an interviewer enters the interview room, greet them with a smile. Interviews can be very nervous, a smile can calm both of you.</p>



<p>* When one of the interviews doesn’t go as expected in your onsite, you have to quickly forget it and move on positively to the next interview. If you do well in 4 out of 5 interviews, they might still offer you the position.</p>



<p>If I missed anything, you can add a comment, I will be happy to answer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Unit tests are unbelievably important to us as developers because they allow us to demonstrate the correctness of the code we’ve written. More importantly, unit tests allow us to make updates to our code base with the confidence that we haven’t broken anything. In our eagerness to get 100% code coverage, however, we often write tests for logic that perhaps we have no business testing. I’m here to assert that creating mock database abstractions in order to write unit tests is a bad idea<em> almost all of the time.</em></p>
<p>At <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a> we have a Postgres database running behind a RESTful Go API server, but we do our best to write small testable functions so that we don’t need to write useless mocks. That kind of code dirties the repository, adds unnecessary abstractions that make the code harder to understand, and doesn’t add any value to the robustness of the test suite.</p>
<h2>What Is a Unit Test?</h2>
<blockquote><p>In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.</p><cite><a aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>In Go, unit tests can be executed using the <code>go test</code> command and some example source code looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func TestLogPow(t *testing.T) {
	expected := math.Round(math.Log2(math.Pow(7, 8)))
	actual := math.Round(logPow(7, 8, 2))
	if actual != expected {
		t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", expected, actual)
	}

	expected = math.Round(math.Log2(math.Pow(10, 11)))
	actual = math.Round(logPow(10, 11, 2))
	if actual != expected {
		t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", expected, actual)
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Where we are testing the <code>logPow</code> function that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">// logPow calculates log_base(x^y)
// without leaving logspace for each multiplication step
// this makes it take less space in memory
func logPow(expBase float64, pow int, logBase float64) float64 {
	// logb (MN) = logb M + logb N
	total := 0.0
	for i := 0; i &lt; pow; i++ {
		total += logX(logBase, expBase)
	}
	return total
}</code></pre>
<p>The goal of unit tests is to test a “unit”, or small portion, of code. If we can break our code into many small testable units, then we can automate much of our testing through these kinds of test suites.</p>
<h2>Good Code Is Easier To Test</h2>
<p><code>logPow</code> is a great example of the perfect candidate for a suite of unit tests. It’s a mathematical function with predictable outputs for any given inputs. Not all functions we write will be nearly this straightforward to test. However, if we can write small and ideally<a href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/purity-in-my-programming-please/"> pure functions where possible</a>, writing tests for them becomes much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Testing shouldn’t be hard.</strong> Simple code is easy to test.</p>
<h2>Unit Tests Shouldn’t Depend On Infrastructure</h2>
<p>In web development, it is commonly regarded as good practice (see <a href="https://reflectoring.io/book-review-clean-code/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clean Code</a>) to create architectural boundaries at every point of I/O. For example, your database functions with all their <code>SQL</code> and driver libraries should be separate from the code that ensures <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-password-validator" rel="noopener">your user’s passwords are secure.</a></p>
<p>Take a look at the following function:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func saveUser(db *sql.DB, user *User) error {
	if user.EmailAddress == "" {
		return errors.New("user requires an email")
	}
	if len(user.Password) &lt; 8 {
		return errors.New("user password requires at least 8 characters")
	}
	hashedPassword, err = hash(user.Password)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	_, err := db.Exec(`                                                                                                                          
		INSERT INTO usr (password, email_address, created)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
		VALUES ($1, $2, $3);`,
		hashedPassword, user.EmailAddress, time.Now(),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}</code></pre>
<p>There is no way to test this function without having a database connection available at the time of testing. If a new developer clones the project they will need to set up a database or else tests will fail. If you set up continuous integration testing pipelines they will also fail without a dummy database on the server. The point is, this is <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>Developers should be able to clone a repo and immediately run tests that pass.</p>
<p>The way to fix the code so that tests can be implemented would be to separate the testable logic. For example:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func saveUser(db *sql.DB, user *User) error {
	err := validateUser(user)
	if err != nil{
		return err
	}
	user.Password, err = hash(user.Password)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := saveUserInDB(user); err != nil{
		return err
	}
	return nil
}</code></pre>
<p>Now our primary function for saving users has been broken into three different functions:</p>
<ul><li>Validate the user</li><li>Hash the password</li><li>Save the user in the database</li></ul>
<p>We don’t need to write a test that tests this function as a whole, we can test the parts we care about independently. Assuming the <code>saveUserInDB</code> function is just making a SQL query, it probably doesn’t need a unit test at all. If the password hashing algorithm contains any more logic than a simple call to a well-tested crypto library then we can easily write a test for it, otherwise, we can trust the tests in the crypto library. The only test we probably need here is to test our own business logic, the <code>validateUser</code> function.</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func TestValidateUser(t *testing.T) {
	err := validateUser(&amp;User{})
	if err == nil {
		t.Error("expected an error")
	}

	err := validateUser(&amp;User{
		Email: "<a href="https://qvault.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="542031272014203127207a373b39">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>",
		Password: "thisIsALongEnoughPassword"
	})
	if err != nil {
		t.Error("should have passed")
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The point is, we need to break our large functions into smaller encapsulated units if we want to have an easy time of writing good tests.</p>
<h2>Don’t Mock Your External Dependencies Either</h2>
<p>While the last rule of thumb, “unit tests shouldn’t depend on infrastructure” is fairly uncontroversial, this next one is a more fiercely debated topic. I believe that the majority of database and API mocking is a result of bad code, and that to fix the problem, the best course of action is to refactor into smaller functions or “units” as we did a moment ago.</p>
<p>However, some engineers would rather lazily create a mock database interface and test the whole damn thing.</p>
<pre><code lang="go">type sqlDB interface {
	Exec(query string, args ...interface{}) (sql.Result, error)
}

type mockDB struct {}

func (mdb *mockDB) Exec(query string, args ...interface{}) (sql.Result, error) {
        return nil, nil
}

func saveUser(db sqlDB, user *User) error {
	if user.EmailAddress == "" {
		return errors.New("user requires an email")
	}
	if len(user.Password) &lt; 8 {
		return errors.New("user password requires at least 8 characters")
	}
	hashedPassword, err := hash(user.Password)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	_, err := db.Exec(`                                                                                                                          
		INSERT INTO usr (password, email_address, created)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
		VALUES ($1, $2, $3);`,
		hashedPassword, user.EmailAddress, time.Now(),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}</code></pre>
<p>With this code, we could now write a unit test that calls the entire <code>saveUser</code> function by passing in a <code>mockDB</code> so that we don’t depend on a running database for tests. As I hope is clear, there are several issues with this approach:</p>
<ul><li>The mock database code is unused in production. <em>We are testing code that literally doesn’t matter.</em></li><li>We technically have better “test coverage” with this approach, but our tests aren’t actually any more robust. We get a false sense of security.</li><li>We have made the <em>real</em> code harder to find by abstracting it behind an interface.</li><li>The fact that <code>saveUser</code> was hard to test was a great signal to us as developers that it needed refactoring. We’ve silenced a good signal that our code needs to be cleaned up.</li></ul>
<h2>Don’t Test Your Dependencies, Ensure They Pass Their Own Tests</h2>
<p>Building on the example of the refactored <code>saveUser</code> function before, we sill have two functions that are likely dependent on third party libraries, namely the <code>hash</code> function and the <code>saveUserToDB</code> function. If we’ve written our code well, those functions shouldn’t do much more than encapsulate a libraries API.</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func hash(password string) (string, error) {
	const cost = 10
	bytes, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), cost)
	return string(bytes), err
}</code></pre>
<p>There is no reason I can see to write a test for the <code>hash</code> function. Before importing the <code>bcrypt</code> library I should have done due diligence and made sure that the maintainers of that codebase have written good tests. Once I’m confident that they had done so, I don’t need to redundantly test all the exported functions.</p>

			<p><span>S</span>ome <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/why-evolution-is-ageist" target="_blank">evolutionary biologists</a> say that after we pass reproductive age, nature, like a cat who’s been fed, is done with us. The bodily systems that thrived and repaired themselves to ensure that we pass on healthy genes cease to function well and leave us to slink to the finish line the best we can. Neuroscientist <a href="http://daniellevitin.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Levitin</a>, author of this year’s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/598506/successful-aging-by-daniel-j-levitin/9781524744182/" target="_blank"><i>Successful Aging</i></a>, says “that’s not an unreasonable interpretation,” but he doesn’t settle for the view that aging after 40 is a long and listless mosey to the grave.</p><p>Levitin, 62, emeritus professor of psychology and neuroscience at McGill University, has lit up readers’ minds with his books on the joys of music, <i>This Is Your Brain on Music</i> and <i>The World in Six Songs</i>. But unlike an aging rocker playing his hits on an oldies tour, Levitin has remained fresh as a writer on the brain, exploring, in <i>The Organized Mind</i>, how to navigate our way through information overload to sane shores. In <i>Successful Aging</i> he details the effects of aging on this too solid flesh, from cell function to motor actions to sleep patterns, and prescribes ways of living to mute the insults of growing old.</p><p>Levitin nicely articulated his insights into better aging and living in our interview. After I transcribed our lively talk, I decided to step out of the picture and present his views on their own, under short subheads.</p> <figure data-alt="Berger_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18026_8031e8f282c78983bc47cc24ce5d90d3.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>a new tune:</strong> “Anything that pushes you out of your comfort zone and forces your brain to do things it hasn’t done before is good,” says Daniel Levitin, also a longtime backing musician and producer. This year he stepped into the spotlight himself and released an embracing album of his songs called <i>Turnaround</i>.</span><span>David Livingston</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>How We Age</b></p><p>We all age at different rates due to our history of exposure to environmental toxins and other stressors, both physical and psychological. That could include a history of a disease like diabetes, or whether you’ve been hit in the head repeatedly. We all know about people who are 50 and whose bodies are giving out, and people who are 90 and going strong. And the brain is a part of the body. Some people are able to enjoy long, sustained periods of cellular housekeeping and repair and others are not. To a neuroscientist, stress is a biological process. It’s not just road rage or being frustrated at work. Stress is a chemical response to things that happen to you and actually impairs the body’s ability to repair itself.</p><p><b>Why We Age</b></p><p>The question of why we age has produced a lot of false answers, such as, “We age because if we didn’t we would overpopulate the earth.” But evolution doesn’t know about overpopulation, so that doesn’t make sense. Or “We age so we don’t take for granted the time that we have.” But that’s nonsensical as well. These might be religious or philosophical notions, but they’re not scientific. We age because there’s been no evolutionary pressure to keep our bodies alive for a long time. I don’t know why that is and I don’t think anybody does.</p><blockquote><p>Successful aging is being able to continue to take pleasure from activities that have historically brought you pleasure.</p> </blockquote><p><b>When We Age</b><br></p><p>Aging begins with conception, fertilization, and cell division. You age in the womb, you age on the day you’re born, you continue to age. After reproductive age, it’s not that nature is done with us, although that’s not an unreasonable interpretation. But the whole idea of Darwinian theory, of descent with modification, random mutation, and natural selection, is that whatever shows up in your genome gets passed to the next generation. It influences the next generation and the generation after that and so on.</p><p>Suppose there were people who had this super genome that allowed them to live to be 100. Let’s take women because the reproductive cut off for women is pretty well defined. If a woman has some genetic modification or mutation that allows her to live to be a 100, that isn’t going to show up in the reproductive genome at age 40 necessarily. It will get passed on, but there’s no selection force. That is, no evolutionary mechanism that causes it to become more common in the population.</p><p>The traits that allow you to attract a mate have to do with your health and mental and physical stability at age 20, 30, and 40. If there’s something that could be happening to you at age 90, there’s no way for that to be selected by evolution because you are likely beyond reproductive age. There’s no evolutionary pressure for it. That’s been the hardline that Alison Gopnik and others have talked about with the “<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/what-good-is-grandma" target="_blank">grandparents syndrome</a>.” In Orca whales and humans, grandparents play a role in raising the grandkids, and so although a grandparent is only passing on a quarter of their genes, to a grandchild as opposed to half their genes to their own children. They are strengthening the viability of that child to go on and reproduce by nurturing it. In other words, the evolutionary pressure to pass on genes might be fulfilled in part by grandparents who have a gene for nurturing behavior that makes both their children and grandchildren more successful in life.</p><p><b>How We Die</b></p><p>At some point, unless we get hit by a bus, we’re all going to die of disease. Which is a way of saying that our ability to repair our bodies and cells won’t be able to keep up with the accumulated damage that life has brought to them. The system just doesn’t function as efficiently as we get older. And at some point it catches up to us and the body shuts down. I mean, nobody just dies, they die of something. A friend of mine’s mother just died. She had cancer and doctors gave her a few months to live. Then she got an <i>E. coli</i> infection because her immune system was compromised trying to fight the cancer. And so then they give her antibiotics. It got rid of the <i>E. coli</i> but then metabolizing the antibiotic was tough on her liver, and her liver wasn’t able to keep up with the cleansing procedures necessary to make it function well, and so she ended up dying about a week later of liver failure. The biggest risk factor for death is age.</p><div>

</div><p><b>Take Pleasure</b></p><p>Successful aging is being able to continue to take pleasure from activities that have historically brought you pleasure, and being able to find new things that provide pleasure. It’s being able to engage with life, with friends and relationships, and being able to make a contribution to the world—whether it’s the way the Dalai Lama and Jane Goodall are doing it, or just the world of your own family.</p><p><b>Be Upbeat</b></p><p>People who have an upbeat personality are more inclined to engage with other people. And other people are more inclined to want to engage with them. Nobody wants to be around a perpetual sourpuss. And social connections are vitally important to life satisfaction and successful aging, and in fact loneliness has been associated with a greatly increased risk of premature death. It compromises the immune system. Upbeat people tend to explore the environment more, which means they’re going to be more apt to learn new things and stay mentally challenged. They don’t get into despair. An optimistic person will more likely take steps to safeguard themselves because they think those steps are going to amount to something.</p><blockquote><p>People who have a personality that’s more generous have brains that are physically different.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Be Sociable</b><br></p><p>The neurochemical serotonin is responsible for mood regulation, and it’s also a precursor to immune system function. So if you’re in a good mood, and your serotonin levels are healthy, that’s going to produce T cells and natural killer cells, which are like the James Bond of the immune system. They handle the most difficult cases. Many of us have cancerous tumors growing in us all the time, but our immune system gets rid of them. We just don’t know about it. That’s how the immune system is supposed to work. When the immune system is compromised, or the cancer evolves some kind of special mutation that makes them resistant to our immune system, you can end up with a malignancy. But being upbeat, being sociable, being engaged with life tends to increase serotonin. And being stressed, which releases cortisol and adrenaline, for evolutionary reasons, turns your immune system off. It also turns off higher cognitive thought, digestion, and libido. In the short term, if you’re trying to escape from a tiger, it’s OK to shut down those systems. But you don’t want them chronically shut down.</p><p><b>Be Realistic</b></p><p>Be optimistic but realistic. You get a big ugly black growth on your arm and you think it couldn’t possibly be cancer and so you don’t have it checked. That’s too much optimism. False hope is tricky. If you’re convinced you’re going to die, and it sends you into a mental funk, depression and stress, that shuts down your immune system. If you’re optimistic and think you can fight this, you may be able to tilt the balance. Somebody could say, “I’ve got a 20 percent chance of living with this for another five years. Screw this, I’m just going to make out my will and sit on the couch and eat bonbons until I go.” But the other person would say, “20 percent? Maybe I can increase that to 30 if I do these things.” And that’s worth doing. You want to avoid the extremes of gullible optimism and fatalistic pessimism.</p><p><b>Be Prepared</b></p><p>We shouldn’t fear death. We need to prepare for it. If you’re afraid of a traffic accident, you still have to drive. You wear your seatbelt, you make sure the car is in good shape, the tires are inflated. Employ the same kind of conscientiousness you do before a long road trip to your own aging process. Follow healthy practices—a good diet, exercise, and good sleep hygiene. Make sure you have a doctor you trust, one you can communicate frankly with, one who sees you as …</p></div></div>

			<p><span>T</span>he Chinese artist Xu Bing has long experimented to stunning effect with the limits of the written form. Last year I visited the Centre del Carme in Valencia, Spain, to see a retrospective of his work. One installation, <i>Book from the Sky</i>, featured scrolls of paper looping down from the ceiling and lying along the floor of a large room, printed Chinese characters emerging into view as I moved closer to the reams of paper. But this was no ordinary Chinese text: Xu Bing had taken the form, even constituent parts, of real characters, to create around 4,000 entirely false versions. The result was a text which <i>looked</i> readable but had no meaning at all. As Xu Bing himself has noted, his made-up characters “seem to upset intellectuals,” in a sly sendup of our respect for the written word.</p><blockquote><p>There was a long way to go from recording goods to writing great works of literature.</p> </blockquote><p>In another room was <i>Book from the Ground</i>, a slim volume, displayed in a room of Xu Bing’s inspiration: symbols and emojis, gathered from around the world and from different contexts, from an airport to a keyboard. Xu Bing scoured the world to find universal images and the result stands in stark contrast to <i>Book from the Sky</i>: This book was designed to be read by anyone. The first page was slightly awkward to read, translating the pictures to the (in my case, English) word. But as I turned the pages, the meaning emerged more fluently, and I was drawn into its story of a day in the life of an office worker. It was as if Xu Bing was asking me to wonder what was happening in my brain as these tiny pictures on the page transformed into meaning, a narrative. How was the process of reading pictorial symbols different from reading letters based on phonetic symbols?<br></p><p>Xu Bing was illustrating what recent studies in neuroscience have revealed: People everywhere read words made from pictures, such as Chinese characters (known as pictographs), and words made from letters, in a remarkably similar way. It’s an insight that opens a window on how writing developed and how we read—and how we might tap deeper wells of creativity and communication.</p><p><span>H</span>umans in different places and times have felt impelled to overcome the limitations of pictures in communicating. Despite the pressing need to capture spoken language in this form, some societies never felt the demand. Until colonialism, aboriginal communities in Australia lived in societies governed by extremely complex laws that passed through the generations entirely through oral means. For tens of thousands of years, rules governing hunting, finding your way, marriage, and ceremony have been embedded in song and performed, learned, and taught in everyday life. There’s beautiful sacred rock art throughout the continent, and symbols used for specific identification, but neither developed into a written system to capture a whole language.</p> <figure data-alt="Wilson_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18052_58f170c366f582dba770b94119f6099a.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BOOKKEEPING:</strong> This example of ancient cuneiform writing dates back to the Bronze Age. Irving Finkel of the British Museum says “a kind of administrative responsibility produced the first stumbling attempt at writing and then eventually a proper fluent script.”</span><span>Fedor Selivanov / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the earliest writing—symbols for meaning rather than pictures alone—is from Mesopotamia, dated to around 3000 B.C.; clay tablets dug up in the archaeological site of Kunara, near the Zagros mountains in modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan. These tablets record quantities of goods in a form of bookkeeping—incoming and outgoing amounts of flour and grains. “The thing about human ingenuity is that when there’s a sharp need for something, it tends to crystallize in discovery,” says Irving Finkel, an assistant keeper of ancient Mesopotamian script, languages, and cultures in the British Museum. Necessity being the mother of invention, in other words. “It’s very probable that it was [a] kind of administrative responsibility which produced the first stumbling attempt at writing and then eventually a proper fluent script,” Finkel says.</p><p>Egyptologist Gunther Dreyer came to similar conclusions during a lifetime of excavating Ancient Egypt, discovering artefacts crucial to our understanding of the development of writing. “Why is there a need to write something down? I think the reason for that is simple,” Dreyer says. “Those are the requirements of accounting.” Dreyer points out that ruling back then, as today, involved “collecting taxes and redistributing. And in a big area, you somehow needed to note down who delivered what when.” Indigenous Australians feeding themselves and their communities through a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, bartering goods with other communities, didn’t need to record such trade, either for a third party far away (such as a tax office) or for posterity.</p><blockquote><p>No writing system goes back much further than 5,000 years, a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.</p> </blockquote><p>But there was still a long way to go from recording goods and quantities to writing great works of literature. Humans all over the world faced the same problems in expressing themselves beyond the here-and-now that speech has covered. It turns out that every ancient writing system solved these problems in exactly the same way. “We like to call it the giant leap for mankind,” Finkel says. The leap is from using a picture as a picture (a logogram) to using it to portray a sound (or phonogram)—the Rebus Principle. Many children play a game using this principle, when they discover that a bee can be used for the sound “be,” and combined with a drawing of a leaf, these two unrelated objects can suddenly produce a meaning—belief.</p><p>But then ambiguity arises: When is a bee a bee, and when is it a sound? Cuneiform, Egyptian, and Mayan hieroglyphs and Chinese all solved the problem in the same way: They added unspoken elements now known as “classifiers” to clear up whether the writer is talking about keeping bees or simply using “be” as a sound. Chinese still uses this system, with picture, phonetic, and classifier elements all crucial to their written system. But in other places a different system took over: the alphabet, invented around 4,000 years ago in the Sinai Peninsula. Stripped of anything but sound, this handful of symbols can be learned quickly, unlike the thousands of Chinese characters that must be mastered for literacy. After a few centuries of remaining at the margins, the alphabet from the Sinai swept through Europe and much of Asia and Africa, changing into the dizzying range we have today.</p><p><span>N</span>o writing system goes back much further than 5,000 years, a mere blink of an eye in evolutionary terms. “Relative to speech [reading is] very young,” says Tae Twomey of University College London, who has spent her career looking into this new trick of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. “The part of the brain that deals with reading had to evolve somehow from the brain that we used before writing was invented.” And it wasn’t just one part that was recruited. “If you think about it, it’s a complex task. You are extracting visual information in order, ultimately, to get to a meaning.” Once I do start to think about this process—a process I can’t remember not being able to do—it starts to seem extremely alien: Thoughts, ideas, instructions, information are being transferred from one human brain into mine, via my optic nerve. But the visual element is only part of the story.</p><p>Twomey’s research uses scans to show the different areas of the brain that are active when we read. “It’s a distributed network,” she explains. Neurologist Thomas Hope, a senior research associate at University College London, offers an analogy. “Like most cognitive behavior, we think reading works like the Nile Delta.” It’s not fed by one stream, he says, “but a bunch of potentially redundant streams.”</p> <figure data-alt="Wilson_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18051_dd5f1fd8442d4ba6b35dd13c9db44343.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>WRITE ON:</strong> Writing arose at different places around the globe, diverging from pictographic to alphabetic symbols. But when we look deep inside the brain, it turns out people everywhere write and read in remarkably similar ways.</span><span>Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure> <p>For reading, there are two large tributaries, broadly correlated with sound and vision. (The third major area working on the task is the Broca’s area, in charge of executive function, which acts as the conductor, orchestrating all the inputs.) Beginning readers sound out each letter to get to the meaning. “Reading is not just to communicate meaning, but also to communicate generally,” Hope says. “And the most common way that we communicate is by speaking. So when you read a word, some part of your brain is sounding out what that word would sound like if you were saying it or if someone was saying it to you.” And that act of speech communication is the same across cultures, whatever the written form of the language, so most readers will be hearing as they read.<br></p><p>But sound isn’t all. “I’ve been watching my children learn to read,” Hope says. “You can’t learn to read just by learning the letters. You have to learn to understand and recognize the words, too.” Readers in an alphabetic system have to learn the equivalent of characters: Learning the shape of a word is basically the same job as extracting the meaning from a pictographic character. But once we get more fluent at reading we tend to use a different tributary more. “Another way, that most skilled readers prefer, is to recognize the whole word as a single entity and connect it directly to meaning,” Hope says.</p><p>The so-called “Cambridge letter,” a meme in 2003, gives a proficient reader a chance to test this latter mode of reading, through shape recognition rather than sounding out the letters:</p><p>Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae.

			<p><span>I</span> remember my grandfather commenting—wry amusement tinged with grim resignation—that what made him finally feel old was seeing his children reach middle age. I was a child then. Now I see my own children, not quite middle aged, starting to have children of their own.</p> <p>Becoming a grandparent is quite lovely, an affirmation of continuity and a front-row-seat to watch (and even, on occasion, participate) as life itself is conveyed into the future. But aging is also our most undeniable <i>memento mori</i>, a reminder not so much of life as one’s own eventual death. My grandfather’s death frightened me as few things have since, except for the recurring recognition (usually at night, alone, in the dark) that his life, everyone’s life, even—astoundingly—my own, is short indeed.</p><blockquote><p>As Buddhists see it, all organisms are necessarily—even marvelously and gloriously—impermanent.</p> </blockquote>


 <p>All things, especially living ones, are marinating in the river of time. We see and understand that our bodies will wear out and we will die. At least that’s how it looks through the lens of Western science, where all things come to an end, winding down in a final surrender to entropy. But there’s another perspective, surprisingly in harmony with science, that helps us revisit that huge and ancient terror—fear of time itself—in a new and perhaps even reassuring way. And that is the perspective offered by Buddhism.</p> <p>For Buddhists, the “center cannot hold,” as the poet W.B. Yeats pointed out, because it doesn’t exist as something rigidly separate from everything else. Nothing is permanent and unchanging, ourselves included. Attempting to cling to a solid, immutable core of a self is a fool’s errand because time not only creates anarchy, it provides the unavoidable matrix within which everything—animate and inanimate, sentient and insensate—ebbs and flows.</p> <p>As Buddhists see it, all organisms are necessarily, unavoidably—even marvelously and gloriously—impermanent. In Sanskrit, the word for impermanence is <i>anitya</i>. To understand <i>anitya</i> is to achieve something remarkable: opening a door onto the accord between modern western science and ancient eastern wisdom.</p> <p>In his book, <i>Physics and Philosophy</i>, Werner Heisenberg—one of the commanding figures in the development of modern quantum physics—wrote that “in the history of human thinking the most fruitful developments frequently take place at those points where two different lines of thought meet.” Contrary to Rudyard Kipling’s injunction, “East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,” I have found, as a trained biologist, that some of the most fruitful developments in modern thinking occur precisely where the twain of biology and Buddhism meet.</p><div>

<p>Even inanimate objects that appear solid and persistent are revealed by modern physics to be in a constant state of flux. An iron bar is mostly empty space, and even the ostensibly solid, sub-atomic particles occupying that space are either moving so rapidly as to be unimaginable or, alternately, exist as clouds of probability rather than as stationary monuments to permanence.</p> <p>With living things, the world is even less fixed. As Yeats observed: “O body swayed to music, O brightening glance / How can we know the dancer from the dance?” Biologists as well as Buddhists know that living stuff is always dancing, constantly replenished by, and created from, nonliving components. At every moment, our existence takes place only on the instantaneous, knife-edge of Now, which can never be captured and held immobile.</p> <p>The story goes that as a young man, the Buddha sought to overcome the imperfections of the real world—sickness, old age, and death—by following the path of traditional Hindu asceticism, mortifying the flesh and nearly starving himself. His eventual enlightenment, however, is said to have involved recognition that all things are temporary, ever-changing, and impermanent. Unlike Christ, who promises eternal life, the last words of the Buddha reportedly began, “Decay is inherent in all things.”</p> <p>But even decay—an unavoidable consequence of time impacting the real world—isn’t something to regret. As the Vietnamese Buddhist monk and scholar, Thich Nhat Hanh, put it, impermanence (<i>anitya</i>) is intimately tied to continuity. “Look back,” he counsels, “and you will see that you not only exist in your father and mother, but you also exist in your grandparents and in your great grandparents.” Look again, and you will see we “have been gas, sunshine, water, fungi, and plants,” he writes. “Nothing can be born and also nothing can die.” To understand this, and to do so deep in our ever-changing bones, may forever change our sense of time and what it means to participate in life on earth.</p>  <p><span>A</span>ging is undoubtedly the most apparent and unavoidable manifestation of how <i>anitya</i> is both revealed by time and produced by it, how impermanence is manifest in every body. Precisely how bodies age is the domain of biological gerontology, which studies such events as the increased accumulation of somatic mutations, reductions in tissue elasticity, increase in autoimmune responses, and diminished length of telomeres (end-pieces of chromosomes that can be likened to the plastic tips at the end of shoelaces, and which evidently protect chromosomes as they undergo cell division). Most human cells poop out after about 60 or so replications, apparently in conjunction with the loss of telomeres, which become a bit shorter with every bout of mitosis—although it isn’t clear whether aging-related decrepitude results from this reduction in telomere length, or vice versa.</p> <p>Whatever the causative sequence, there is no fountain of youth. We can reduce the rate of decline by eating healthy foods, reducing stress, and exercising regularly. But the effect, at best, is to slow the process, never to stop it altogether. To be a museum conservator, exercise fanatic, or just a dedicated daily dental flosser is to be more Sisyphus than Ponce de León.</p> <p>But this is too pessimistic. A Buddhistically informed view suggests that even as everything changes over time, this very impermanence is connected to a deeper kind of persistence. One of the more striking visual demonstrations of this is the practice among Tibetan monks of constructing gorgeous sand mandalas, complex designs and patterns laboriously built over many days, after which they are ceremoniously swept away. Proxies for ourselves, mandalas symbolize the impermanence of everything, no matter how lovely, complex, treasured, or important.</p><figure data-alt="Barash_BREAKER_Mandala" data-title="Sands%20of%20Time" data-capper="Tibetan%20Buddhist%20monks%20create%20a%20mandala%20of%20colored%20sand%2C%20a%20symbol%20of%20impermanence." data-credits="DIBYANGSHU%20SARKAR/AFP/Getty%20Images"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/2217_b5c01503041b70d41d80e3dbe31bbd8c.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Sands of Time:</strong> Tibetan Buddhist monks create a mandala of colored sand, a symbol of impermanence.</span><span>DIBYANGSHU SARKAR/AFP/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Some years ago, while waiting for a wilderness permit at a Forest Service ranger station in the small town of Sedro Woolley, Wash., I overheard a radio message sent in by a ranger: “Dead elk in Agnes Creek decomposing nicely. Over.” The ranger was ecologically sophisticated as well as Buddhistically accurate. Although a decomposing elk might not be everyone’s idea of “nice,” the process is as necessary to a healthy ecosystem as it is unavoidable. (The “over” was an especially nice touch.)</span><br></p> <p>For another good example of biological <i>anitya</i>, one that overturned prior biological dogma, consider Dolly, who famously emerged as the world’s first artificially cloned sheep. Before Dolly, it was widely held that once vertebrate cells had fully differentiated—becoming, say, muscle or skin or, in the case of Dolly’s “mother,” mammary gland tissue—they were permanently fixed and couldn’t become a different kind of cell.</p> <p>Dolly was created when an already differentiated nucleus was implanted into an enucleated egg cell, and a new animal emerged, complete with a full array of distinctly different cell types. Cell differentiation is evidently not a one-way street, as previously believed. One of the things built into life itself is, ironically, impermanence and the capacity to change.</p> <p>The reality of <i>anitya</i> extends to whole genomes, which are permeable to genes introduced from other lineages. This is why we can put cold-resistance genes from halibut into frost-vulnerable tomatoes. (Whether we should is another question.) Even without high-tech human intervention, the evolutionary reality of continuity among all living things is inseparable from the fact that all lineages have themselves evolved—that is, they have changed over time, and continue to do so. The seemingly rigid boundaries between cells and within species are flexible and inconstant. Living things do not simply have the capacity for impermanence; rather, at what we might oxymoronically call their “core,” they are profoundly and deeply impermanent and ever-changing.</p> <p>What about whole organisms taken in their entirety? After all, each halibut, hickory tree, or human being appears to be distinct and fixed in time—or at least identifiable as this object, this creature, this person. But each “this” is largely an artifact of our own limited perception of time and its impact. Wait long enough, give time the opportunity to work its way, and every living thing changes, undergoing embryogenesis, growth, senescence, and finally death. In short, time will tell.</p> <p>Question: When a Buddhist nun goes to a beauty parlor, what is she is likely to get? Answer: an impermanent.</p>  <p><span>I</span>t would seem, nonetheless, that living things struggle to defy <i>anitya</i>, to resist change. The technical term among physiologists is “homeostasis,” the process whereby organisms maintain their internal environment within limits. This is notably true of mammals, which possess various adaptations to keep their internal temperature independent of the outside environment. At least as important, however, is the internal chemical environment: not too acid, not too alkaline, enough sodium, potassium, and calcium. Without a precisely stable Goldilocks balance, life ceases.</p> <p>In a narrow sense, that is a defiance of <i>anitya</i>. But the physiological constancy required by life can only be achieved in …</p></div></div>

Whether you want to tell the story of your walkabout through Europe, your quest to climb the tallest mountain in California, your nights and weekends developing the skills of your daughter's soccer team, or your efforts to transform the culture of your business or organization you need to know and appreciate the various complexities of effective narrative. By using techniques proven time and time again to be successful towards the structuring of a great story, we can help frame your life's events into something truly captivating--and meaningful.</p>
<p>As mentioned several times here and elsewhere, life is meaningless until we put the events of our lives into context. <strong>Stories give meaning to our lives by putting everything in context.</strong> Fusing character, plot, theme, and genre into one cohesive "message" the mundane, chaotic, seemingly inconsequential moments of our lives become transformative.  </p>
<p>The following is a sneak-peak at the step-by-step approach we use when <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/mentorship">helping writers craft their story</a>, whether fiction or non-fiction. Feel free to start using it in developing your own projects, and we look forward to hearing your story soon.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-plot">The Basic Plot</h2>
<p>The first four story points concern the story itself. What were you after and how it all turned out. Where the pressure came from and how you felt about the experience. Laying the groundwork for the narrative up front helps set the stage and starts to give form to the formless. </p>
<h3 id="step-one-the-story-goal">Step One: The Story Goal</h3>
<p>The first and possibly the easiest step to take is to define the Goal of your story. The <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-goal" title="Story Goal - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Goal</a> helps set the context for what you will be looking at and gives a starting and ending point for the narrative. Did you want to learn everything you could about Eastern culture? Maybe you had a half-marathon you wanted to compete in. Maybe you wanted to win the half-marathon.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Or maybe you wanted to help your business embody Old World principles of respect and honor. Regardless the type of Goal, there was some endgame you had in mind--something you set out to accomplish. Write about that Goal.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-the-story-continuum">Step Two: The Story Continuum</h3>
<p>Now that you have set the context for your story, begin to take a look at the kind of story you want to tell. Every great story comes to an end because the characters run out of time, or run out of options. Both exist within the context of a story, but one will be seen as the lens to <em>appreciate</em> the other.</p>
<p>Since you are the character in this story, which one sounds most appropriate? Did you set out on a walkabout through five Eastern European countries?  If so, then your story elevates space over time; the countries take precedence over which one was first, or which one was second. Your story explores conflict in <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/dynamics/spacetime">Spacetime</a>. You likely felt as if time was running out when you hit that last country, but that is what it is like to be <em>in</em> your story.</p>
<p>With Dramatica and these Story Points, you want to step outside of yourself and your own experience and see story as this <em>thing</em>--this entity that you are sculpting. It can be difficult at times, especially since the fun part of writing is pretending you are the characters and living vicariously through them. The only problem with that approach is you will never be able to see the forest for the trees. You might find meaning, but <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/articles/the-veil-between-author-and-audience" title="The Veil Between Author And Audience - Narrative First">you will never be able to predict how your story should work</a> to give that meaning.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-continuum" title="Story Continuum - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Continuum</a> looks one way to the Author, but a completely different way to the characters within the story. As you are crafting a story, you need to be able to see outside of your own experience and see what <em>objective</em> elements set the narrative into motion. With the walkabout through Europe, it may have felt at the time as if you were running out of time, but putting that kind of time limit on a narrative would not grant the same feeling to your readers. A Continuum of Spacetime gives the characters, and by proxy the Audience, a feeling of time running out.</p>
<p>Perhaps your story took time to look at space. Maybe you were preparing for a marathon that took place 57 days from when you started. You probably pulled out a calendar and circled that date. Each morning you woke up, checked off a day, and set about training for the end. As that day rapidly approached, you probably felt panicked as if you were <em>running out of things you could do</em>--options you could take. Your story would explore conflict in <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/articles/series/dynamics/timespace">Timespace</a>.</p>
<p>Whether writing a story about the relative potentials of various options (Spacetime) or the temporal sequencing of linearity (Timespace), take some now to weave that Story Continuum into your paragraph about the Story Goal.</p>
<p>Each of these Story Points builds upon the last. The Goal sets a finish line, the Continuum sets the path towards that Goal. In fact, all of these Story Points work together to tell the holistic "message" of your story. In essence, you sculpt your story by adding to it, rather than shaving away the bits you don't need. With each of these steps, build upon the last to create a lasting and transformative narrative.</p>
<h3 id="step-three-the-story-outcome">Step Three: The Story Outcome</h3>
<p>This one is easy. Did you win or lose?</p>
<p>Did you land that account or climb that mountain? Did your sales team embody those principles of success or did they tear themselves apart? Did you fail to make the quarterfinals in that screenplay contest? Or did you find out that you can never truly know all there is to know about a culture?</p>
<p>Whatever the <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-outcome" title="Story Outcome - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Outcome</a>, write a new paragraph about what happened at the end of your story. Silly and simple, yes--but essential towards communicating the eventual message of your story. You set out to achieve the Story Goal. The Story Continuum defined the context and direction of those efforts. At the end, you either achieved success or you failed miserably.</p>
<p>And not personal success or personal failure. It is likely you set out to accomplish one thing, but learned something else was far more important. That is a great story and one many want to communicate. But the "far more important" angle is found in another Story Points, not this one. What you want to do with the Story Outcome is focus on whether or not the Goal was reached. How you felt about that outcome is the subject of our next Story Point.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-the-story-judgment">Step Four: The Story Judgment</h3>
<p>In a separate paragraph at the end, write about how you felt about your entire experience. Was it worth it visiting all those countries? Did you find relief after finishing the marathon? Or did you feel worse about even participating? Did you end up even more lost and confused at your workplace?</p>
<p>The Story Goal--the thing you originally set out for--is a cold and logical Story Point, devoid of emotion or any real passion. The same can be said of the Story Continuum and the Story Outcome. But here at the end, clueing us in on how you felt about the story gives us the Audience a reason to care. It helps us empathize with your plight and understand everything you went through.</p>
<p>Our minds crave emotional logic every bit as much as they chew on rational logic. A story needs both sides lest it risk having "holes" in the logic. Failing to give an Audience an emotional assessment of a narrative is akin to reading the stock section of the Wall Street Journal. Unless you tell us how you feel about Progress, we see only numbers.</p>
<p>As you can see with this last Story Point--the <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-judgment" title="Story Judgment - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Judgment</a>--we are starting to work our way towards the more personal side of things. We start with the rational side of things because it can often be easier, particularly if you are dealing with your own life's story. But Audiences want to know the intimate details. They want to know who you are, where you came from, and what issues you had to overcome.</p>
<h2 id="opening-up">Opening Up</h2>
<p>Having established a framework for your story and a context for the events, we now turn our attention towards you. This is often the most difficult part of turning anyone's life into a story because it can be hard to sit back and take an objective look at yourself. We need to identify the personal issues in your life as they are the key to giving your story emotional resonance.</p>
<p>Your readers or viewers want a reason to care. They want to know something intimate about you that they can somehow relate to their own life's struggle. If you stay closed off and refuse to open up and be honest about what you went through, the story itself will feel closed and muted. No one wants to sit through a story like that.</p>
<p>If these events just occurred, the emotional fallout may still be so overwhelming that you're not sure where to start or know exactly where it is you were coming from. The more time you have between the end of what happened and the time when you begin the story can make all the difference in understanding your own issues.</p>
<h2 id="the-characters">The Characters</h2>
<p>For a story to connect, an emotional attachment needs to be made between Author and Audience. Successful Authors do this by giving the central character of their story deep personal issues--issues that may be familiar or recognizable to an Audience. The more honest and true these issues are, the greater the connection.</p>
<h3 id="step-five-your-own-personal-baggage">Step Five: Your Own Personal Baggage</h3>
<p>In a separate paragraph at the beginning of your story, write about your own personal baggage and those issues you brought to this narrative. What made it more difficult for you to reach the Story Goal and what prevented you from seeing the endgame? In the middle of your story, write about how you worked through that baggage, and then at the end let us know what happened to it all.</p>
<p>In Dramatica, this personal baggage is known as the <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/main-character-domain" title="Main Character Domain - Appreciations - Subtext">Main Character Throughline</a>. You are the Main …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Some of my friends have been telling me that Windows machines got a lot better. I decided to give it a try, and bought a top of the line Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 8. For all of you thinking about doing the same switch, you might want to read this first.</p>

<p>Even though Apple is known for overpricing, and taking advantage of their customer base, they do it in a larger scheme of things, and do not engage in business practices which have a low customer experience. Unfortunately, you can’t say the same about the Lenovo universe.</p>

<p>Just go to their <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/">website</a> for a minute. Try to figure out which Laptop to buy, without getting the feeling you are being scammed. Everything seems to be on sale all the time, there are laptops of different generations of the same product line being advertised to you. They lie to your face about the battery life-times. People who are buying these machines got used to this experience, and are proud of being able to navigate such websites. You really need to do your homework before buying anything.</p>

<p>For example: I bought the X1 with their standard FHD screen, and it feels older than my 7 years old MBP. When trying to figure out why, I found out that Lenovo has a “<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-s-Panel-Lottery-continues-with-3-different-14-inch-LowPower-displays.426538.0.html">panel lottery</a>”: They use different suppliers with remarkable quality differences for their displays. Which one you get is just based on luck. Turns out the panel I got is the same they use for their cheapest product line. This means I have a ghosting mouse pointer on a $2000 brand new machine. Nice.</p>

<p>Even if you are lucky with the screen: it does not come color calibrated out of the box! Good luck trying to find the correct color profile, unless you want to spend money on a calibration tool you’re only going to use once.
Then comes Windows:</p>

<p>Yeah, it got better, but wow, do they carry a lot of baggage around. When trying to calibrate the display I found out that Windows has no less than three different system configuration UIs, which are also intertwined in unexpected ways. On top of that Lenovo installed their own buggy configuration tool. Configuring Windows feels like walking on ice. Even with all this configuration might, it still was not possible to get the exact serial number of my display panel without installing a third party tool.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also constantly nagging you about something that marginally helps their bottom line, but costs you a lot of your user experience. Like their constant push to trick people into giving them their data, or the fact that they try to force you to use their browser whenever they can.</p>

<p>I’m still not sure if I ticked the right boxes so that Microsoft does not get my browsing behaviour. I feel stressed every time Microsoft wants something from me. How are they trying to scam me this time?</p>

<p>For me this reinforces my belief that people who like Windows are simply used to it, because they need it for work or playing games. There is no point arguing with this, as their added value is their own experience, and the fact they know the tools and tricks to make the system usable to them.</p>

<p>One friend even told me that one of his favourite improvements in newer Windows versions is that they made it a lot easier to completely reset the operation system. My Apple machine has never been reset since I bought it almost a decade ago, and works flawlessly.  His statement seems like a subtle warning as to what is expecting me in the near future using my new  machine.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>H</span>oliday-season traditions stretching back for centuries have linked wintertime romance to decorative&nbsp;sprigs of mistletoe. The way that the plantâ€™s rounded evergreen leaves and white berries tightly hug the branches of the trees on which it grows probably inspired that association. The truth&nbsp;about this botanical intimacy is&nbsp;less romantic: Mistletoe is a kind of parasite. Its leaves produce sugars by photosynthesis, but instead of roots, it has structures that pierce the host treeâ€™s vital tissues to suck out nutrients and water.</p>

<p>But that interdependence goes even deeper, and scientists are just starting to realize the ways in which mistletoes are unique at the molecular level because of it. The cells of all multicellular organisms rely on the organelles called mitochondria to make their biochemical fuel—all multicellular organisms except mistletoes, that is. Not only do their mitochondria produce little if any of this fuel, theyâ€™ve lost many of the genes needed to make it. In the few years since botanists discovered this anomaly, scientists worldwide have tried with no more than limited success to figure out how mistletoes pull off this trick.</p>
<p><strong>Cellular Powerhouses Go Offline</strong></p>
<p>The first hint that mistletoes were truly&nbsp;<em>sui generis</em>&nbsp;was presented in 2015 at the International Conference for Plant Mitochondrial Biology in WrocÅ‚aw, Poland, by&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-zvgjbUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Elizabeth Skippington</a>, then a postdoctoral fellow in&nbsp;<a href="https://biology.indiana.edu/about/faculty/palmer-jeffrey.html" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palmer</a>â€™s lab at Indiana University. She astounded the small scientific audience with evidence later&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/27/E3515" target="_blank">published in&nbsp;</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1504491112" target="_blank"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>&nbsp;that one mistletoe species (<em>Viscum scurruloideum</em>) had an extremely tiny mitochondrial genome and lacked key proteins thought to be required for respiration — the chemical pathway that enables mitochondria to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cellsâ€™ molecular fuel.</p>
<p>â€œIt felt like everybody was holding their breath,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genetik.uni-hannover.de/en/institute/people/people/epv/section-v-plant-proteomics/graduate-teachingresearch-assistant/jennifer-senkler/?tx_t3luhepv_t3luhepvoe%5BdisablePersHomepages%5D=" target="_blank">Jennifer Senkler</a>, a plant biochemist with Leibniz University in Germany, who attended the talk. â€œIn the next break, everybody was chatting excitedly about this and speculating on how this could work.â€�</p>
<p>They wondered if perhaps Skippington missed the genes because they had become unrecognizable, or if there was some error in her methods. Or maybe the genes had moved into the nuclear genome—thatâ€™s something that can happen with mitochondrial genes, after all, and mistletoesâ€™ enormous&nbsp;genomes (about 24 times the size of ours) have thus far impeded whole-genome sequencing. Everyone was eager to solve the mystery of the missing genes.</p>
<p>â€œWe started joking about researchers falling off trees in the attempt to get their hands on mistletoe plants,â€� Senkler wrote in an email to&nbsp;<em>Quanta.</em>&nbsp;Indeed, as soon as she and her colleagues returned to Germany, â€œwe bought a long branch cutter and started collecting mistletoes.â€�<br></p>
<p>They werenâ€™t the only ones. Not far from Senklerâ€™s lab in Hannover, at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam-Golm, the biochemist&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.urz.uni-halle.de/cellphysiology/more-about-etienne/" target="_blank">Etienne Meyer</a>&nbsp;started some investigating of his own. And at the John Innes Center in Norwich, England,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/janneke-balk/" target="_blank">Janneke Balk</a>&nbsp;similarly decided to dig into mistletoe mitochondria. Balkâ€™s team soon reached out to Meyerâ€™s, and the two labs joined forces, though they kept running their experiments in parallel for the most part to ensure the results were replicated. â€œThatâ€™s what makes the story even more solid,â€� Meyer said.<br></p>
<p>In the end, all three research teams came to&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.036" target="_blank">the same conclusion</a>: Mistletoe mitochondria donâ€™t perform the same ATP-generating process as the mitochondria of all other plants, fungi and animals. The genes Skippington spoke of are truly gone, not mutated or repositioned. And as yet, no one knows how mistletoes survive without them.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolic Misers</strong></p>
<p>In all other multicellular life studied to date—and in most single-celled eukaryotes, for that matter—mitochondria produce ATP in a five-step process. Each step is performed by a separate suite of proteins, complexes I-V. â€œAnd one of these, the very first complex, is totally missing in mistletoes,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/gipe0376-1.379971" target="_blank">Gitte Petersen</a>, a botanist at Stockholm University in Sweden.</p>
<p>Trained as a plant systematist, Petersen at first thought that maybe this loss of complex I might be common. But when she and her colleagues&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-019-1401-8" target="_blank">checked nine other parasitic plant groups</a>, the rest were normal. Something special seemingly happened in the mistletoes alone.</p>
<blockquote>â€œIn the next break, everybody was chatting excitedly about this and speculating on how this could work,â€� says&nbsp;Jennifer Senkler of&nbsp;Leibniz University.</blockquote>

<p>As for how mistletoes compensate for the loss of these incredibly important genes, â€œwe can only speculate,â€� Meyer said.</p>
<p>Experiments show that mistletoes make some ATP; itâ€™s just unclear whether their mitochondria play a large part in that. Meyer and Balkâ€™s collaboration found that the plants do produce more proteins&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.036" target="_blank">for use in glycolysis</a>, an inefficient method of splitting apart sugars to make ATP thatâ€™s found in all cells. However, the scientists couldnâ€™t determine exactly how much ATP the plants generate that way.</p>
<p>Still, ramping up glycolysis enough to rival mitochondriaâ€™s usual ATP output would take a lot more sugar. Meyerâ€™s hunch is that the mistletoes steal sugar from their host, along with&nbsp;water and minerals. They might even photosynthesize more feverishly than other plants to make extra sugars to burn, although Meyer labels that idea â€œextremely hypothetical.â€�</p>
<p>Mistletoes may&nbsp;also just use energy with Scrooge-like miserliness. Both Senkler and Petersen pointed out that a parasitic lifestyle and slow growth could&nbsp;enable mistletoes to subsist on low amounts of ATP. In fact, â€œmistletoe might teach us a lesson on how to survive at energy-limiting conditions,â€� Senkler said.</p>
<p><strong>Too Complex to Keep?</strong></p>
<p>However mistletoes get by with their deficient mitochondria, the big unanswered question is why these plants did away with something so seemingly useful.</p>
<blockquote>â€œ[M]istletoe might teach us a lesson on how to survive at energy-limiting conditions,â€� says&nbsp;Jennifer Senkler of&nbsp;Leibniz University.
</blockquote>
<p>Senklerâ€™s suspicion is that complex I was too burdensome to keep. It consists of about 50 proteins that have to be made in different subcompartments of the cell, assembled and fit into the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The energy cost of all that is considerable, even if it means more energy in the long run, and â€œmistletoes seem to avoid processes that require much energy,â€� she said.</p>
<p>Ditching energy-expensive traits, or â€œreductive evolution,â€� is a common theme in parasites, Meyer noted. And losing this particular suite of proteins might have additional benefits. Because complex I spews highly reactive molecules that can cause cellular damage, losing it could make the plants more resilient to stress. Similar mitochondrial gene losses are frequently seen in cancer cells, which is partly why malignant cells can often survive conditions that other cells wouldnâ€™t.</p>
<p>But Petersen isnâ€™t convinced the loss is beneficial at all. It could be that something like a catastrophic mutation befell the mistletoes early in their groupâ€™s evolution, something that accidentally wiped out their ability to make complex I. â€œAnd then mistletoe just managed to cope with what happened,â€� she said, perhaps because mistletoeâ€™s parasitic lifestyle offered ways to compensate. She is curious about whether additional genetic sequencing might let researchers suss out when the loss happened and whether the plants were already parasitic.</p>
<p>If it does turn out that the plantsâ€™ loss of complex I was random bad luck, then perhaps mistletoes are just like the rest of us: Theyâ€™re doing whatever it takes to survive the holidays.</p>

<p>Our newsletter API is live, hosted on a Cloud provider.<br>
We have a basic set of instrumentation to troubleshoot issues that might arise.<br>
There is an exposed endpoint (<code>POST /subscriptions</code>) to subscribe to our content.</p>
<p>We have come a long way!</p>
<p>But we have cut a few corners along the way: <code>POST /subscriptions</code> is fairly... permissive.<br>
Our input validation is extremely limited: we just ensure that both the name and the email fields are provided, nothing else.</p>
<p>We can add a new integration test to probe our API with some "troublesome" inputs:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]

</span><span>#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_200_when_fields_are_present_but_empty</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// Arrange
    </span><span>let</span><span> app = </span><span>spawn_app</span><span>().await;
    </span><span>let</span><span> client = reqwest::Client::new();
    </span><span>let</span><span> test_cases = vec![
        ("</span><span>name=&amp;email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com</span><span>", "</span><span>empty name</span><span>"),
        ("</span><span>name=Ursula&amp;email=</span><span>", "</span><span>empty email</span><span>"),
        ("</span><span>name=Ursula&amp;email=definitely-not-an-email</span><span>", "</span><span>invalid email</span><span>"),
    ];

    </span><span>for </span><span>(body, description) in test_cases {
        </span><span>// Act
        </span><span>let</span><span> response = client
            .</span><span>post</span><span>(&amp;format!("</span><span>{}</span><span>/subscriptions</span><span>", &amp;app.address))
            .</span><span>header</span><span>("</span><span>Content-Type</span><span>", "</span><span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><span>")
            .</span><span>body</span><span>(body)
            .</span><span>send</span><span>()
            .await
            .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>Failed to execute request.</span><span>");

        </span><span>// Assert
        </span><span>assert_eq!(
            </span><span>200</span><span>,
            response.</span><span>status</span><span>().</span><span>as_u16</span><span>(),
            "</span><span>The API did not return a 200 OK when the payload was {}.</span><span>",
            description 
        );
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The new test, unfortunately, passes.<br>
Although all those payloads are clearly invalid, our API is gladly accepting them, returning a <code>200 OK</code>.<br>
Those troublesome subscriber details end up straight in our database, ready to give us problems down the line when it is time to deliver a newsletter issue.</p>
<p>We are asking for two pieces of information when subscribing to our newsletter: a name and an email.<br>
This chapter will focus on name validation: what should we look out for?</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="1-1-domain-constraints">1.1. Domain Constraints</h2>
<p>It turns out that names are complicated<sup><a href="#patio-names">1</a></sup>.<br>
Trying to nail down what makes a name <em>valid</em> is a fool's errand. Remember that we chose to collect a name to use it in the opening line of our emails - we do not need it to match the real identity of a person, whatever that means in their geography. It would be totally unnecessary to inflict the pain of incorrect or overly prescriptive validation on our users.</p>
<p>We could thus settle on simply requiring the name field to be non-empty (as in, it must contain at least a non-whitespace character).</p>
<h2 id="1-2-security-constraints">1.2. Security Constraints</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, not all people on the Internet are good people.<br>
Given enough time, especially if our newsletter picks up traction and becomes successful, we are bound to capture the attention of malicious visitors.<br>
Forms and user inputs are a primary attack target - if they are not properly sanitised, they might allow an attacker to mess with our database (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>), execute code on our servers, crash our service and other nasty stuff.<br>
Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p>What is likely to happen in our case? What should we brace for in the wild range of possible attacks?<sup><a href="#threat-modelling">2</a></sup><br>
We are building an email newsletter, which leads us to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>denial of service - e.g. trying to take our service down to prevent other people from signing up. A common threat for basically any online service;</li>
<li>data theft - e.g. steal a huge list of email addresses;</li>
<li>phishing - e.g. use our service to send what looks like a legitimate email to a victim to trick them into clicking on some links or perform other actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we try to tackle all these threats in our validation logic?<br>
Absolutely not!<br>
But it is good practice to have a layered security approach<sup><a href="#defense-in-depth">3</a></sup>: by having mitigations to reduce the risk for those threats at multiple levels in our stack (e.g. input validation, parametrised queries to avoid SQL injection, escaping parametrised input in emails, etc.) we are less likely to be vulnerable should any of those checks fail us or be removed later down the line.</p>
<p>We should always keep in mind that software is a living artifact: holistic understanding of a system is the first victim of the passage of time.<br>
You have the whole system in your head when writing it down for the first time, but the next developer touching it will not - at least not from the get-go. It is therefore possible for a load-bearing check in an obscure corner of the application to disappear (e.g. HTML escaping) leaving you exposed to a class of attacks (e.g. phishing).<br>
Redundancy reduces risk.</p>
<p>Let's get to the point - what validation should we perform on names to improve our security posture given the class of threats we identified?<br>
I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforcing a maximum length. We are using <code>TEXT</code> as type for our email in Postgres, which is virtually unbounded - well, until disk storage starts to run out. Names come in all shapes and forms, but 256 characters should be enough for the greatest majority of our users<sup><a href="#longest-name">4</a></sup> - if not, we will politely ask them to enter a nickname.</li>
<li>Reject names containing troublesome characters. <code>/()"&lt;&gt;\{}</code> are fairly common in URLs, SQL queries and HTML fragments - not as much in names<sup><a href="#xkcd">5</a></sup>. Forbidding them raises the complexity bar for SQL injection and phishing attempts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's have a look at our request handler, as it stands right now:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/routes/subscriptions.rs
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::{web, HttpResponse};
</span><span>use </span><span>chrono::Utc;
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::PgPool;
</span><span>use </span><span>uuid::Uuid;

#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(serde::Deserialize)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>FormData {
    </span><span>email</span><span>: String,
    </span><span>name</span><span>: String,
}

#[</span><span>tracing</span><span>::</span><span>instrument</span><span>(
    name = "</span><span>Adding a new subscriber</span><span>",
    </span><span>skip</span><span>(form, pool),
    </span><span>fields</span><span>(
        email = %form.email,
        name = %form.name
    )
)]
</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe</span><span>(
    </span><span>form</span><span>: web::Form&lt;FormData&gt;,
    </span><span>pool</span><span>: web::Data&lt;PgPool&gt;,
) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse, HttpResponse&gt; {
    </span><span>insert_subscriber</span><span>(&amp;pool, &amp;form)
        .await
        .</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|_| HttpResponse::InternalServerError().</span><span>finish</span><span>())?;
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().</span><span>finish</span><span>())
}

</span><span>// [...]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Where should our new validation live?</p>
<p>A first sketch could look somewhat like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/routes/subscriptions.rs
 
// An extension trait to provide the `graphemes` method 
// on`String` and `&amp;str`
</span><span>use </span><span>unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation;

</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe</span><span>(
    </span><span>form</span><span>: web::Form&lt;FormData&gt;,
    </span><span>pool</span><span>: web::Data&lt;PgPool&gt;,
) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse, HttpResponse&gt; {
    </span><span>if </span><span>!</span><span>is_valid_name</span><span>(&amp;form.name) {
        </span><span>return </span><span>Err(HttpResponse::BadRequest().</span><span>finish</span><span>());
    }
    </span><span>insert_subscriber</span><span>(&amp;pool, &amp;form)
        .await
        .</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|_| HttpResponse::InternalServerError().</span><span>finish</span><span>())?;
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().</span><span>finish</span><span>())
}

</span><span>/// Returns `true` if the input satisfies all our validation constraints

    </span><span>!(is_empty_or_whitespace || is_too_long || contains_forbidden_characters)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>To compile the new function successfully we will have to add the <code>unicode-segmentation</code> crate to our dependencies:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> add unicode-segmentation
</span></code></pre>
<p>While it <em>looks like</em> a perfectly fine solution (assuming we add a bunch of tests), functions like <code>is_valid_name</code> give us a false sense of safety.</p>

<p>Let's shift our attention to <code>insert_subscriber</code>.<br>
Let's imagine, for a second, that it requires <code>form.name</code> to be non-empty otherwise something horrible is going to happen (e.g. a panic!).</p>
<p>Can <code>insert_subscriber</code> safely assume that <code>form.name</code> will be non-empty?<br>
Just by looking at its <em>type</em>, it cannot: <code>form.name</code> is a <code>String</code>. There is no guarantee about its content.<br>
If you were to look at our program in its entirety you might say: we are checking that it is non-empty at the edge, in the request handler, therefore we can safely assume that <code>form.name</code> will be non-empty every time <code>insert_subscriber</code> is invoked.</p>
<p>But we had to shift from a <em>local</em> approach (let's look at this function's parameters) to a <em>global</em> approach (let's scan the whole codebase) to make such a claim.<br>
And while it might be feasible for a small project such as ours, examining all the calling sites of a function (<code>insert_subscriber</code>) to ensure that a certain validation step has been performed beforehand quickly becomes unfeasible on larger projects.</p>
<p>If we are to stick with <code>is_valid_name</code>, the only viable approach is validating <em>again</em> <code>form.name</code> inside <code>i…</code></p></article></section></div>

You will learn all the basics about the CPU power management in this post.</p><p>The processor/CPU is designed to operate forever under a specific load. As almost none of us are doing a <code>24x7</code> calculation employing all the resources of the CPU continuously, it is most of the time not operating in its designed maximum. So what is the point of keeping the whole CPU powered on at its full capacityÂ&nbsp;? This is the point of CPU power management. The power management topic covers much more than this, including the RAM, GPU etc., but I am going to tell you only about the CPU side of the story in this post.</p><p>If you know about C-states and P-states and how CPU enters to and exits from these states, probably there is nothing new in this post for you. If not, continue reading.</p><p>I was planning to include a few real-world examples from Linux, but the post was getting longer and taking even more time to finish, so I will do that in another post.</p><p>The general information in this post is applicable to all modern CPUs but the details can be very specific to the individual CPU (esp. to the processor family) and I am using an IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E3-1245 v5 @ 3.50GHz, this is a Xeon E3â€“1200 v5 series (formerly Skylake) processor (model number 0x5e).</p><p>The main references used in this post are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-technical-resources.html">Intel(R) Xeon Processor E3â€“1200 v5 Product Family Datasheets</a></li><li><a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/88173/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1245-v5-8M-Cache-3_50-GHz">Intel(R) Xeon Processor E3â€“1245 v5 Product Specification</a></li><li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/white-paper/energy-efficient-platforms-2011-white-paper.pdf">Sofware Impact to Platform Energy-Efficiency (Intel White Paper)</a></li><li><a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf">Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a></li><li><a href="http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_6_2.pdf">ACPI Specification v6.2</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface">ACPI page on Wikipedia</a></li><li>Linux Kernel Sources version 4.13.0</li></ul><p>Unless otherwise noted, all original figures and tables are from the datasheet.</p><ul><li>2019/03/01: Added CoreFreq output to last section.</li></ul><p>On its <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/52274/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1245-8M-Cache-3_30-GHz">official product page</a>, my CPU has the following features listed:</p><ul><li>Idle States</li><li>Enhanced Intel SpeedStepÂ® Technology</li></ul><p>You can see on the page that “Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle.” and “Intel SpeedStepÂ® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load.”</p><p>You will learn what both of these descriptions mean throughout this post.</p><p>On a production CPU (so not considering the things that can be done while designing the CPU), to save power, you can do two things. You can:</p><ul><li>eliminate the power consumption of a subsystem (a core or other resources like clock or cache) by completely powering it down (so cutting down the voltage, reducing it to zero)</li></ul><p>or</p><ul><li>decrease the power consumption by decreasing the voltage and/or the frequency of the subsystem and/or the whole processor</li></ul><p>The first one is simple to understand, if you shut down the power, you do not consume any power.</p><p>The second requires a bit more explanation. The power consumption of an integrated circuit (such as a processor) is proportional linearly to frequency and quadratically to voltage.</p><p>P ~ f VÂ²</p><blockquote><p>Note for those of you knowing more about digital electronics:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pcpu is actually = Pdynamic + Psc + Pleak</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>On an active CPU, Pdynamic is the most important part, it is the part I mention here, being proportional to the frequency and quadratically to the voltage.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Psc=Pshort-circuit is proportional to the frequency.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pleak is proportional to the voltage.</p></blockquote><p>Also, the voltage and frequency is not independent, and seems to have a linear relationship. (<a href="http://async.org.uk/tech-reports/NCL-EEE-MICRO-TR-2015-197.pdf">http://async.org.uk/tech-reports/NCL-EEE-MICRO-TR-2015-197.pdf</a>)</p><p>Higher (serial) performance requires both higher frequency and higher voltage, thus having even a larger effect on the power consumption.</p><p>This depends a lot on the processor but E3â€“1245 v5 @ 3.50 Ghz has Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 80 Watts. This is an average value the CPU can sustain forever (Power Limit/PL1 in the figure below) and it is usually the value that the cooling solutions should be designed at for reliability. Actual power CPU consumes can temporarily go higher (as shown as PL2, PL3 and PL4 in the figure below). TDP is measured under a high-complexity (~worst case) load with all cores active at the base frequency (of 3.50 Ghz).</p><figure><img data-src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/cpu-package-power-control-figure-5-1.png" alt="CPU Package Power Control" src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/cpu-package-power-control-figure-5-1.png"><figcaption><p>CPU Package Power Control</p></figcaption></figure><p>You can see in the figure above that the CPU can consume more power than TDP at PL2 for up to 100 seconds, that is actually quite a long duration.</p><p>The two ways to decrease the power consumption of a processor:</p><ul><li>powering down subsystems</li><li>voltage/frequency reduction</li></ul><p>is accomplished by using:</p><ul><li>C-states</li><li>P-states</li></ul><p>respectively.</p><p>C-states describe the first case, so they are the idle (power saving) states. In order to power down a subsystem, that subsystem should not be running anything, so it should be at idle, doing nothing, executing nothing. So C-state x, Cx, means one or more subsystems of the CPU is at idle, powered down.</p><p>On the other hand, P-states describe the second case, so they are the executing (power saving) states. The subsystem is actually running but it does not require full performance so the voltage and/or frequency it operates is decreased. So P-state x, Px, means the subsystem it refers to (e.g. a CPU core) is operating at a specific (frequency, voltage) pair.</p><p>Because most modern CPUs have multiple cores in a single package, C-states are further divided into core C-states (CC-states) and package C-states (PC-states). The reason for PC-states is there are other (shared) components in the processor that can also be powered down after all cores using them are powered down (e.g. the shared cache). However, as a user or programmer, we cannot control these, since we do not interact with the package directly, but we interact with the individual cores. So we can only affect the CC-states directly, PC-states are indirectly affected based on the CC-states of the cores.</p><p>The states are numbered starting from zero like C0, C1â€¦ and P0, P1… The higher the number is the more power is saved. C0 means no power saving by shutting down something, so everything is powered on. P0 means maximum performance, thus maximum frequency, voltage and power used.</p><p>The basic C-states (defined by ACPI) are:</p><ul><li>C0: Active, CPU/Core is executing instructions. P-states are relevant here, CPU/Core may be operating at its maximum performance (thus at P0) or at a lower performance/power (thus at anything other than P0).</li><li>C1: Halt, nothing is being executed, but it can return to C0 instantenously. Since it is not working (but halted), P-states are not relevant for C1 or any Cx other than C0.</li><li>C2: Stop-Clock, similar to C1 but it takes longer time to go back to C0.</li><li>C3: Sleep. It can go back to C0, but it will take considerably longer time.</li></ul><p>Many modern CPUs have plenty more C-states and according to its datasheet IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E3-1200 v5 Family has C0, C1, C1E (C1 Enhanced), C2, C3, C6, C7 and C8. C1 and C1E are CC-states only, and C2 is only a PC-state. All others are both a CC-state and a PC-state.</p><blockquote><p>Note: There are also thread level C-states because of Intel Hyper-Threading. However, the individual threads can only request C-states but power saving action only takes place when the core enters to that C-state. I will in general omit talking about Thread C-states and Hyper-Threading in this post.</p></blockquote><p>The descriptions of these states from the datasheet are:</p><figure><img data-src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/processor-ia-core-package-state-support-table-4-2.png" alt="Processor IA Core / Package State Support Table" src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/processor-ia-core-package-state-support-table-4-2.png"><figcaption><p>Processor IA Core / Package State Support Table</p></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Note: LLC above refers to Last Level Cache, meaning the shared L3 cache in the processor.</p></blockquote><p>and here there is a visual description:</p><figure><img data-src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/flexible-c-states-to-select-idle-power-level-vs-responsiveness-figure-4.png" alt="Flexible C-states to select Idle Power Level vs. Responsiveness (from Software Impact to Platform Energy-Efficiency White Paper)" src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/flexible-c-states-to-select-idle-power-level-vs-responsiveness-figure-4.png"><figcaption><p>Flexible C-states to select Idle Power Level vs. Responsiveness (from Software Impact to Platform Energy-Efficiency White Paper)</p></figcaption></figure><p>A very basic timeline of power saving using C-states is:</p><ul><li>The normal operation is at C0.</li><li>First, the clocks of idle core is stopped.

(C3)</li><li>Then, when all the cores are powered down, the shared cache (L3/LLC) of the package is flushed and at the end the package/whole CPU can be (almost) powered down. I said almost because I guess there has to be something powered on to return back to C0.</li></ul><p>As you might guess, CC-states and PC-states are not independent, so some combinations are impossible.

On the other hand, if a core is completely powered down (C8), the package can still be at C0 if any other core is still running.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Intel Software Developer’s Manual mentions sub C-states, or substates, meaning a C-state (type) actually contains one or more sub C-states. After checking the intel_idle driver code in the Linux kernel, I understand for example C1 and C1E has the same state type C1, but they are subtypes 0 and 1.</p><p>The number of subtypes of the eight C-state types (0..7) for C1..C8 is discovered by CPUID instruction. Looking at my CPU, cpuid program output returns:</p></blockquote><pre><code>MONITOR/MWAIT (5):

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Discuss some differences between macOS and common Unix systems to help Unix users get familiar with macOS sooner.</p><div>
				
<h2 id="users-and-groups">Users and Groups</h2>

<p>macOS manages users and groups by directory services instead of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and  <code>/etc/group</code>.  Consider a local network, for example, the one in your office, there’re many computers in the network and each has its own files, accounts, etc. A directory service organizes these distributed resources into one single index and makes them look like a directory hierarchy.</p>

<p>For example, <code>/Hosts/PC1</code> represents a host in the network and <code>/Users/Smith</code> represents a user in the network.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>macOS uses the <code>dscl</code> command to interact with directory services.</p>

<p>To list all users on the system, we could run the following.</p>



<p>The first argument sets which datasource we want to retrieve from. A dot means the local datasource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># List groups
dscl . -list /Groups
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-list</code> option lets <code>dscl</code> print subitems of a resource.  Subitems of <code>/Users</code> are all users. Subitems of <code>/Groups</code> are all groups.</p>

<p>If we want to check the information about the resource instead of listing subitems we should use <code>-read</code>. For example, we could check the information of the user <code>Smith</code> like
the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Retrieve the information of Smith
dscl . -read /Users/Smith
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>-read</code> prints keys and values of the specified resource. We could also specify the keys we want.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Get the primary group ID and default shell of Smith
dscl . -read /Users/Smith PrimaryGroupID UserShell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To add a resource, we use <code>dscl . -create</code>. The following command adds a new user <code>belson</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seems ok but it’s actually not. If we try to set a password for <code>belson</code> using <code>sudo passwd belson</code>, <code>passwd</code> will tell us the user doesn’t exist. Because <code>dscl</code> just adds a record to the data source but is doesn’t check the integrity. It doesn’t even assign a UID for <code>belson</code>. We must assign a UID and a primary group for <code>belson</code> after adding it to the datasource by ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UniqueID 511	# UID 511 for example
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson PrimaryGroupID 20	# The staff group
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <code>belson</code> is a Unix user and you can set a password for him using <code>passwd</code>. However, you still can’t login as <code>belson</code> for we don’t assign him a shell.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UserShell /bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well we can login as <code>belson</code> now but he doesn’t have a home directory. We must create the directory and specify it with <code>dscl</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson NFSHomeDirectory /Users/belson
sudo mkdir /User/belson
sudo chmod -R belson:staff /User/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sounds hell right? But it’s not over. Run <code>dscl . -read /Groups/staff</code> and you will find that
neither the <code>GroupMembers</code> nor the <code>GroupMembership</code> attribute has any information about <code>belson</code>.  We have specified his primary group to <code>staff</code>. But as mentioned above, <code>dscl</code> doesn’t check the integrity. Bidirectional relationships must be maintained manually. This is the real hell.</p>

<p>To solve the user-group relationship problem, we could use <code>dseditgroup</code>. The following command adds <code>belson</code> to the <code>staff</code> group and it takes care of the integrity.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should make a summary here. To create a user <code>belson</code> in the group <code>staff</code>, we need:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UniqueID 511	# UID 511 for example
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson PrimaryGroupID 20	# The staff group
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UserShell /bin/bash
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson NFSHomeDirectory /Users/belson
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
sudo mkdir /User/belson
sudo chmod -R belson:staff /User/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is painful for a system administrator to type so many commands just to create a new user. You must miss <code>adduser</code> and <code>addgroup</code> in Debian so much.</p>

<p>Luckily, since Mac OS X 10.10, the <code>sysadminctl</code> command is provided. It’s a high-level interface of <code>dscl</code>. Type <code>sysadminctl</code> in the terminal to see its usage<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Usage: sysadminctl
	-deleteUser &lt;user name&gt; [-secure || -keepHome] (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-newPassword &lt;new password&gt; -oldPassword &lt;old password&gt; [-passwordHint &lt;password hint&gt;]
	-resetPasswordFor &lt;local user name&gt; -newPassword &lt;new password&gt; [-passwordHint &lt;password hint&gt;] (interactive] || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-addUser &lt;user name&gt; [-fullName &lt;full name&gt;] [-UID &lt;user ID&gt;] [-shell &lt;path to shell&gt;] [-password &lt;user password&gt;] [-hint &lt;user hint&gt;] [-home &lt;full path to home&gt;] [-admin] [-picture &lt;full path to user image&gt;] (interactive] || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-secureTokenStatus &lt;user name&gt;
	-secureTokenOn &lt;user name&gt; -password &lt;password&gt; (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-secureTokenOff &lt;user name&gt; -password &lt;password&gt; (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-guestAccount &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-afpGuestAccess &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-smbGuestAccess &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-automaticTime &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-filesystem status
	-screenLock &lt;immediate || off&gt; -password &lt;password&gt;

Pass '-' instead of password in commands above to request prompt.
'-adminPassword' used mostly for scripted operation. Use '-' or 'interactive' to get the authentication string interactivly. This preferred for security reasons
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use <code>sysadminctl</code> to delete <code>belson</code> first.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo sysadminctl -deleteUser belson -secure
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <code>dscl</code> to check the directory service, we could find that everything we did is removed.</p>

<p>Now, we add <code>belson</code> again with <code>sysadminctl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo sysadminctl -addUser belson
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Two commands finish the job.</p>

<h2 id="filesystem-hierarchy">Filesystem Hierarchy</h2>

<p>If you check the root directory, you will see some traditional Unix things like <code>/usr</code>, <code>/var</code>, and <code>/etc</code>. You may also find mac-specified things like <code>/Library</code> <code>/Applications</code>, and <code>/cores</code>.</p>

<p>A list of mac-specified directories with their purposes in the root directory is here<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/private</td>
      <td>Contains the tmp, var, etc, directories. <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/var</code>, <code>/etc</code> are symbolic links to these subdirectories</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Library</td>
      <td>Contains support files for locally installed applications, among other things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/System</td>
      <td>Contains a subdirectory, Library, that holds support files for the system and system applications, among other things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Network</td>
      <td>Contains network-mounted Application, Library, and Users directories, as well as a Servers directory that contains directories mounted by the auto mount daemon.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Users</td>
      <td>Contains home directories for the users on the system. The root user’s home directory is /var/root (actually /private/var/root).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Volumes</td>
      <td>Contains all visible mounted filesystems, including removable media and mounted disk images.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We could make a list to compare some of them with Linux.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>macOS</th>
      <th>Linux</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/System/Library</td>
      <td>/lib</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Library</td>
      <td>/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Users</td>
      <td>/home</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Volumes</td>
      <td>/mnt, /media</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You may be confused here for the difference between <code>/Library</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code>. Which directory should we put libraries into?</p>

<p><code>/Library</code> is for macOS-specified softwares, like the data of things you download from the App Store, and BSD programs shipped with macOS, like modules of pre-installed Perl and of pre-installed Python.</p>

<p><code>/usr/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code> are for Unix programs installed by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="booting">Booting</h2>

<p>In modern Linux, the first program launched by the kernel is <code>systemd</code>. In macOS it’s <code>launchd</code><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p><code>launchd</code> manages two types of services, <code>LaunchDaemon</code> and <code>LaunchAgent</code>. <code>LaunchDaemon</code> will be launched after the system is booted. <code>LaunchAgent</code> will be launched after a user is logged-in.</p>

<p>If a program needs to be launched after the system is booted, a <code>.plist</code> file is required to be placed into <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> or <code>/System/LaunchDaemons</code>.</p>

<p>If a program needs to be launched after a user logged-in, a <code>.plist</code> file is required to be placed into <code>/Library/LaunchAgents</code> or <code>/System/LaunchAgents</code>, or <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents</code> of the user.</p>

<p>The <code>launchctl</code> command is used to control services of <code>launchd</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># to enable sshd
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

# to disable sshd
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>You bought a Mac for development. People told you that you need to do the following two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Install Xcode from the app store</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install command line tools using <code>xcode-select --install</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You finished them, opened the terminal and found everything is familiar. You decided to write a classic Hello World with C to celebrate.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
	printf("%s\n", "hello, world");
	return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re using a 3rd party compiler, the compiler may tell you that <code>stdio.h</code> can’t be found.</p>

<p>No such fundamental file? You want to check <code>/usr/include</code> and you will find that even <code>/usr/include</code> doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>The reason is that header files are put into the package of Xcode in newer Xcode like Xcode 10. You can run <code>xcrun --show-sdk-path</code> to print the path<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun --show-sdk-path
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can use <code>-isysroot</code> to specify the path for the compiler, for example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gcc -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk hello.c
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="package-manager">Package Manager</h2>

<p>The first package installed to the system is usually a package manager. However, macOS has no default package manager. If you search online, you will find that <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the most popular package manager for macOS.</p>

<p>Homebrew is good for many people but not for one who wants things to go more like common Unix systems.</p>

<p>Homebrew can’t run as root. If you want to install python, you run <code>brew install python</code> instead of <code>sudo brew install python</code>. Homebrew installs packages to <code>/usr/local</code>. To achieve its goal about sudo-free, Homebrew changes the owner of all files and subdirectories under <code>/usr/local</code> to the user who installed Homebrew.</p>

<p>This brings security issues. Considering a malware …</p></div></div>

		<h2 id="board-view-is-here">Board View is here</h2>

<p>For Todoist users, the Board View was introduced in this new update, a more visual way to organize your Planner projects. This new layout makes it easy to see the big picture of your projects and make progress from start to finish.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/board.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board"></p>

<p>To see your projects in the <b>Board View</b>, press the three dots icon in the top right, and select <b>View as board</b>. You’ll be able to rearrange your sections, create new ones, and drag your tasks to anywhere on your board.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/board-settings.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<h2 id="sub-project">Sub-project</h2>
<p>One of the most requested features comes to Planner 2.6, keep your ever-growing project list neat and organized with sub-projects.</p>

<p>You can collapse sub-projects under their “parent” projects to temporarily hide them from view. This helps to focus on the right projects at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-turn-a-project-into-a-sub-project">How to turn a project into a sub-project</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Right click on a project.</li>
  <li>Select the <b>Move</b> option.</li>
  <li>Select a project.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<h3 id="quick-search">Quick Search</h3>

<p>A big update for the Quick Find feature is here, with new views and feactures.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/Quick%20Search.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick Search now saves your last searches, so you can hop around without even typing.</li>
  <li>Added new <b>Tomorrow</b> view.</li>
  <li>Now it is possible to search between <b>Sections</b></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task-defaults">Task defaults</h3>

<p>Added a new view in <b>Preferences</b> to edit task defaults.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/tasks-defaults.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<ul>
  <li>New tasks on top: Indicate the position where the new tasks were created.</li>
  <li>Underline completed tasks.</li>
  <li>Default priority: Select the default priority when creating a task.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="add-tasks-projects-sections-asynchronously">Add tasks, projects, sections asynchronously</h3>

<p>Adding a task, project or section is a quick process but sometimes this process stops or does not respond mainly to problems with the internet connection. Planner 2.6 creates the tasks asynchronously with the possibility of being able to cancel the process at any time.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/AsyncTask.gif" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<h3 id="filter-your-projects-by-labels">Filter your projects by labels</h3>
<p>It is now possible to filter the tasks within a project by labels.</p>

		<p><strong>About Outer Orbit</strong><br>
		<em>Outer Orbit</em> is an attempt to create a “Spacewar!-for-one” as a tribute to the line of heritage of digital video games. It combines elements of the most classic shooter games, <em>Spacewar!</em> (1961/62) <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/">[1]</a>, the first known video game on a digital computer, <em>Computer Space</em> (1971) <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/rc2017/04/02.html" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/icss/" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[4]</a>, the first coin-operated digital video game, and <em>Asteroids</em> (1979) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[5]</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From <em>“<a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/" target="_blank">Spacewar!</a>”</em> it borrows the comic book spaceship, the central star, gravity and orbital mechanics,</li>
			<li>from <em>“<a href="https://www.masswerk.at/icss/" target="_blank">Computer Space</a>”</em> the game mechanics of the saucer opponents and the time-based gameplay,</li>
			<li>from <em>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asteroids</a>”,</em> well, the asteroids, which serve here just as additional obstacles to make the game a bit trickier.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Enjoy!</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> A wave has a fixed duration of 80 seconds. You may progress to the next wave/level, if you manage to outscore the saucers in a given level, i.e. shoot the saucers more often than your ship crashes, by this maintaining a positive balance. Mind that the balance is reset to zero at the start of each level.</p>
		<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Like in <em>Spacewar!</em> enter an orbit around the gravitational star by aligning your spaceship perpendicular to its center and firing your thruster for two or three seconds. — Do not attempt to destroy asteroids, dodge them.</p>
		<p><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> The sound-scape is for the most a homage to <em>Computer Space,</em> less the background hum. The display font is based on definitions for a PDP-1 font renderer (early 1960s) and implemented in software. In order to bring the iterative machanics of a gravity based game to the modern age of asynchronous rendering, the game is computed internally in fixed time slices of an 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a second and the display rendered on demand.</p>
		<p><strong>Setting an Initial Level:</strong> Experienced players may want to select the initial level by specifying a wave as an URL-parameter, as in <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/outerorbit/?wave=30">https://www.masswerk.at/outerorbit/?wave=30</a> for a game starting at wave #30.</p>

      <p><a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html">Linux is not a secure operating system</a>. However, there are steps you can take to improve it. This guide aims to explain
      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>
      
      DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy,
      not performance, usability, or anything else. </p><p>

    </p></div>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to
      legitimate traffic.
    </p>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This protects against <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1337">time-wait assassination</a>…</p></div>

            <p>
                Posted on <time datetime="2020-12-24 09:53:00">December 24, 2020</time>
            </p>
                        <p>According to conventional wisdom, if you earn 31€/hour, and a task costs less than that to outsource, then you should always pay someone else to do it. For example, if your cleaning person charges 15€/hour, you save 16€ for every hour you spend at work instead of cleaning your house.</p>
<p>I've encountered this advice quite often, particularly among the wealthier, productivity porn-loving, <em>4-Hour Work Week</em>-thumping entrepreneur crowd.<br></p>
<p>I don't think that advice is quite right.</p>
<h2>Your time is worth less than you think</h2>
<p>There is a hefty tax on converting time to money. In Germany, if you earned the average income (42 421€ per year)<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a></sup>, you'd lose roughly a quarter of it to income tax<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=einkommensteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup>. Your 31€/hour salary<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a>, <a href="https://clockify.me/working-hours">2</a></sup> is actually worth 24€/hour after taxes.</p>
<p>But there is more to account for: health insurance (7.3%), unemployment insurance (1.25%), public pension (9.3%) and nursing care insurance (1.775%)<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=lohnsteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup> are also deducted from your salary. When it's all said and done, you take home about 20€/hour. If you also pay church tax and get the most expensive health insurance, you keep 19€/hour.</p>
<p>So again, if you earn the average 31€/hour, and work the average 1386 hours per year, you save about 4€ per hour - not 16€ - by hiring a cleaning person who charges half your rate.</p>
<p>Taxes aren't the only thing that whittle away your disposable income. You also have some unavoidable expenses, namely rent, groceries and utilities. That's 550€, 150€ and 100€ per month for a single, thrifty Berliner. That's 35% of your take-home salary, so you're left with 12.50€/hour in disposable income. At this point, I'm including decimals, because they start to matter.</p>
<p>In other words, you must sell 72 minutes of your life to buy 60 minutes of your cleaning person's life, even though you earn twice as much.</p>
<p>Here's a recap for the mathematically inclined:</p>
<pre>hourly_disposable income = (
    (gross_income - income_tax)
    - health_insurance
    - unemployment_insurance
    - pension_insurance
    - nursing_care_insurance
    - (rent + groceries + utilities) * 12
) / hours_worked_per_year</pre>
<p>Keep in mind that this describes the reality in Germany, where people work much less, but pay higher taxes. You will get wildly different results in your own country.</p>
<h2>Outsourcing costs more than you think</h2>
<p>Eating out is often used as an example of trading money for time. It's faster than cooking your own food: no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.<br></p>
<p>In Berlin, you can get a square meal for 10€. A croissant, a coffee and two square meals would set you back 20€ a day. By comparison, my grocery bill is 5€ a day. That's a 450€/month difference, or 37.5 hours of your time (see above), but you'd probably spend that much time between the supermarket and the kitchen anyway.<br></p>
<p>However, getting to&nbsp;the restaurant, ordering, waiting for your food, then waiting for the bill takes time too. Personally, I&nbsp;find cooking every other day more convenient  than eating out twice a day. Eating out only makes sense when I'm too tired to cook.<br></p>
<p>This also applies to hiring professionals. You still need time to find one and to work with their schedule. I can change the oil or the brakes on my motorcycle in about 30 minutes. It takes me about as long to drop my bike off at the dealership, but I&nbsp;have to do it during office hours, and wait a few days to get it back.<br></p>
<p>In short, outsourcing your work does not always make life easier. It can lighten your mental load, but so does working less by having lower expenses.<br> </p>
<h2>Time is not a liquid asset</h2>
<p>In practice, you don't get to choose how much of your time you sell.&nbsp;If your expenses are covered, you just can't stop going to work. If you need more money, you could work more, but rarely on your own terms, just when you need to. You couldn't sell an extra 2 hours of programming on a Thursday night, because you have nothing else going on.&nbsp; There's also a limit on how much time you can sustainably sell, regardless of demand - about 60 hours a week.<br></p>
<p>You can't choose which time you sell either. Most employers will only buy your office hours. You can't decide to work night shifts, or to work 80 hour weeks in the winter, then take the summer off. You can't even decide where to allocate the time you <em>didn't</em> sell. Your employer usually decides when you take your lunch breaks, and when you can use your holidays. If you're on call, even your free time isn't quite yours.</p>
<p>In other words, you don't really trade more time at the office for less time cleaning your house. You're stuck at the office for 40 hours a week regardless, so you're just using some of your fixed budget. However, if you <em>don't</em> hire a cleaning person, and you don't spend your money, then you can buy some&nbsp;of your time back later, either as a gap year, or as an early retirement.</p>
<p>As a freelancer, you have much more control over what time you sell, and in which amount. Nonetheless, you are still bound to standard contract lengths, to the limits of your body, and to cyclical demand in your industry. A freelance accountant likely won't take time off during tax season. A freelance developer will mostly find 3 to 6 month contracts.<br></p>
<p>Put shortly, time is not a liquid asset. You can't easily  sell more or less of it according to your needs.</p>
<h2>Time does not have a fixed value</h2>
<p>Let's pretend that your boss lets you work for as long as you need, whenever you need to. You could spend an extra hour at the office, and pay someone to save you an hour of cleaning.</p>
<p>I'd make that deal. Swearing at my computer brings me joy, but doing the dishes doesn't. I'd gladly trade a few hours of programming for a few hours of cleaning.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/good-time.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>My definition of a good time</figcaption></figure>
<p>After 30 hours a week, I'd start to value my time at the office a bit more. I'd rather spend that time at home, sipping a beer on my balcony with a pie in the oven, so I&nbsp;wouldn't be so keen to sell it.</p>
<p>After 50 hours, I'd be selling my time at a much higher price. There's a point where work takes a toll on your body, and seeps into other aspects of your life.&nbsp;By then, menial work feels like a release, rather than a chore.</p>
<p>Unless you&nbsp;<em>really</em> like your job, there comes a point where you'd rather do something else, even if has a lower market value than your profession.<br></p>
<h2>The hidden benefits of doing it yourself</h2>
<p>The most understated benefit of doing things yourself is the skills and the tools you acquire along the way. Your cooking gets better and more diversified with every meal you cook. Bike repairs get cheaper and easier with every attempt. Those skills stay with you, and over time, the benefits compound. You can tackle bigger and bigger projects, and the results look better and better.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/level-up.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>Outsourcing, on the other hand, doesn't get better and cheaper. It either gets better and more expensive, or cheaper and worse. This ties your quality of life to a single variable: your income. Your lifestyle is much more reliant on your ability to stay employed, because it's the only thing you can do.<br></p>
<p>Beyond that, doing things yourself is immensely rewarding. Wrenching on your own motorcycle feels good. Delighting your guests with a home-cooked meal feels good. Using shelves you built yourself feels good. These are direct products of your hard work, and symbols of the control you have over your environment.</p>
<p>I'd also argue that it gives you a greater appreciation for the world you live in. It allows you to see things beyond the surface. Musicians appreciate music on a different level,
 and the same can be said for gardeners, machinists, architects and 
every other kind of enthusiast. My fledgling interest in gardening quite literally made me see the forest for the trees.<br></p>
<p>Paying someone else to do it robs you of this joy. Climbing through the career ladder provides its own rewards, but those always felt too abstract to me. If I  indirectly make my company a little leaner, I&nbsp;get 4% more disposable income. Big whoop.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Some tasks don't develop useful skills. They don't get easier, cheaper or more enjoyable with time. Chores are chores, and some work is just plain tedious. No matter how good I&nbsp;get at painting walls, I still hate it with a passion.&nbsp;My father fixed cars his entire life, and he won't change his oil in the winter, when the car is caked in&nbsp;slush.</p>
<p>Life is short, and the 40 hour work week isn't going anywhere, so it's okay to spare your free time for things you enjoy. That's worth paying a premium for.</p>
<p>Even if you enjoy doing something, the timing isn't always right.&nbsp;I found that my motorcycle's front rim was bent just before leaving for a 3 month trip. I already had a lot on my plate with work and trip preparations, so I paid a mechanic to do it. Outsourcing lets you solve multiple problems in parallel.</p>
<p>In some cases, the upfront cost of doing things yourself is just too high. I won't resurface my motorcycle's cylinder head at home, because the tools cost more than my net worth, and highly trained machinists will do it for 100€.&nbsp;Sometimes, it's better to let economies of scale do their thing.</p>
<p>In other cases, the running costs are too high. All those things you maintain will chip away at your free time. In aggregate, they can swallow your evenings. For example, think twice about running your own server to save a few euros per month. These needy buggers tend to require your attention at the most inopportune times. Outsourcing means someone else is taking care of it, and invoicing you once a month.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the risk isn't worth the potential savings. It's important to learn how to do things yourself, but don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't cause hundreds of euros worth of damage to save a few euros. Hire a professional, and let them do their job.&nbsp;If they cock up, <em>they</em> are liable to fix the mess, not you.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, outsourcing has its time and place, but it's more expensive than it appears. Sometimes, it's better to do things yourself, and acquire useful skills …</p></article></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Improving Communication in Development Teams]]>

  <p>
    <span>December 7, 2020</span>

  </p>

  <p>
    In software development, communicating productively is as important as
    writing quality code quickly. Maybe even more important - studies show that
    most problems in software projects are in fact communication problems.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="why-focus-on-communication">
    <a href="#why-focus-on-communication">Why focus on communication?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    On the Internet, you can find many articles and studies about
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+software+projects+fail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      why software projects fail
    </a>. They cite different reasons, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lack of understanding of business needs;</li>
    <li>Vague or poorly communicated requirements;</li>
    <li>Unrealistic timelines or expectations;</li>
    <li>False belief that scope can be defined upfront;</li>
    <li>Inadequate planning;</li>
    <li>Too many or too few people assigned to a project;</li>
    <li>Poor reporting of project status;</li>
    <li>Unmanaged risks;</li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you look closer, you'll notice that these reasons point to one thing in
    common: a disconnect between management and developers. So removing this
    disconnect should yield great returns.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">
    <a href="#does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">Does it mean we should talk more?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What would improve communication between developers and management? This is
    a broad topic, but one idea's obvious: they must communicate frequently
    enough to be on the same page about goals, requirements, priorities, work
    progress, project challenges, and risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates another problem though: to be productive, developers need
    prolonged periods of quiet time. They need to do focused work, without
    distractions. Meetings distract developers from writing code. And waiting
    for the meeting can be even worse. If people know they'll be interrupted
    soon, they'll feel discouraged from starting anything big. Paul Graham
    wrote a great article about this -
    <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, so on one hand we need to talk to developers, but on the other we
    shouldn't distract them so much that they can't be productive. Finding this
    delicate balance may be hard, but we can make the job easier by removing
    trivial questions from the discussion. Below I'll give some examples of how
    well organized processes and technology can help us talk less, but do more.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">
    <a href="#stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">Stop asking who's working on what</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    One such trivial question is “Who's working on what?” Isn't that what the
    task tracker's for? All task trackers incorporate concepts like Assignee
    and Status. When tasks are accurately assigned with up-to-date statuses,
    you'll have immediate visibility about who's working on what and how long
    they've been working on it. Besides that, you may occasionally need to
    return to old completed tasks. Having an accurate task history helps you
    return easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though task tracking sounds simple, in practice it requires a manager's
    effort to keep your task tracker in good shape. People may forget to switch
    task statuses, or assign tasks to themselves. Someone might not have a task
    in progress at all. Someone else might have multiple tasks in progress,
    which once again, doesn't tell us what exactly they're working on.
  </p>

    That's why we created these "In progress"

    Teamplify connects to your task tracker, like Jira or Trello. If it's not
    clear what developers are working on, it will politely ask, in Slack or
    over email, to update their task status. These notifications are smart and
    unobtrusive. They also take all kinds of non-working days into
    consideration, so they won't disturb your teammates on their vacation.
    More on that later.

  <p>
    Today, almost every development team uses at least some version of these
    collaboration tools:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>code hosting - for example, GitHub or GitLab;</li>
    <li>task tracker - Jira, Trello, or similar;</li>
    <li>chat - many teams use Slack;</li>
    <li>video conferencing software, such as Zoom.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These tools are usually shared with the whole team, so any team member can
    take a look and learn something about work progress. Unfortunately,
    looking over each tool is not a convenient way to learn what the team has
    been busy on. Because the information is fragmented, not everyone will be
    willing to dig through it. It's much easier to ask about the status in a
    meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created the Team Calendar view, which collects all the work
    activity from your team tools and puts it in one place. It also shows
    national holidays, vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a>:
  </p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar displays the most important types of team work activity,
    including code commits, task updates, and communication over video and chat.
    It also automatically detects when someone mentions a task in chat messages
    and code commits. For example, if a task was discussed somewhere in Slack,
    you'll see it, and be able to click directly to that discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Better visibility into work progress means better informed managers, with
    less need for meetings and less developer distractions.
  </p>

  </h2>


  <p>
    Time off plays an important role in short-term project planning. Even in
    small organizations, people don't always remember who's going on vacation
    next week. And if your team is distributed, it's quite easy to forget about
    other country's national holidays.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone's absence is a surprise, it's not good for your project.
    Making time-off clearly visible helps people better plan around it.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we added time-off management to Teamplify. National holidays,
    vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a> are visible on the
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Team Calendar</a> mentioned above.
    You can also configure notifications for Slack or email:
  </p>

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if people miss the notification and mention someone who is absent
    today, Teamplify will politely remind them:
  </p>

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also request a vacation or add another status via the Teamplify
    Slack bot, so you can manage off time without leaving Slack.
  </p>

    <a href="#identify-stuck-progress">Identify stuck progress</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Even the best and brightest developers get stuck sometimes. There may be an
    unexpected technical problem, or maybe the task turns out to be more
    difficult than previously thought. In such cases, brainstorming with
    colleagues may help find a solution or an alternative path and boost the
    progress significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we haven't seen any code activity from a developer in a while, it
    doesn't necessarily mean that they're stuck, but it might signal a good
    time to check if everything's alright.
  </p>

  <p>

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stuck communication is just another form of stuck progress. This could be a
    lengthy discussion without any productive decision. More often, it's just a
    question that's been waiting too long for an answer:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.webp?3490 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.webp?3490 2x" type="image/webp">

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    If a bot can politely remind your correspondent about your pending
    question, it means you don't have to. Besides that, bot notifications are
    sometimes better perceived. If a person reminds you every day about pending
    questions, it might be annoying. But if a bot does the same - it's probably
    okay, because, you know, it's just a bot.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="bottom-line">
    <a href="#bottom-line">Bottom line</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    When communication improvements add up, the result is a more productive
    work environment, where people are better informed and spend less time on
    discussing trivial questions. We have a lot of complex problems to solve,
    let's focus on them instead.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><main><article role="article"><div><p>In a previous life, I was an electronic music designer working on Broadway shows in New York City. Broadway shows look glamorous and expensive on the outside, but it’s often quite the opposite on the inside –&nbsp;at least for the music department. One of the toughest parts of my job as an electronic music designer was to find the best performance-to-cost ratio for computer rigs powering keyboards, guitars, playback tracks, and more.</p><p>Over the past decade, Broadway has replaced large sections of traditional orchestras with synthesizers, playback systems, and electronic drum pads. I’m not in support of that, but that’s a story for another day. The point here is that Broadway’s reliance on computer-driven rigs has increased, while the typical budget required to build high-end stable rigs hasn’t increased at the same rate.</p><p>Some shows I’ve worked at set aside a $10,000-$12,000 budget for two keyboard rigs. That sounds like a lot of money at first, but it’s not. For live shows, it’s usually best to have a 1:1 backup in case the main rig fails. That fact alone means you have to design a rig that fits within 50% of the proposed budget. Furthermore, a high-quality keyboard controller alone is $1,500-2,000 –&nbsp;so that means there’s $3,000 left for a computer and everything else.</p><p>Due to budget constraints, many shows end up using Mac minis. Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.</p><p>Apple Silicon changes everything for Broadway electronic music designers. The new M1 Mac mini is capable of running high-end sample libraries and virtual instruments in a stable manner, and it’s only going to get better with M2, M3, and M4-series chips in the future. The performance per dollar characteristics of Apple Silicon machines are going to have a huge impact on Broadway’s sound, and I’m very excited to see, or hear, what happens.</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

                <h4>Friday, December 25, 2020 · 7 min read</h4>
<p>It’s Christmastime again! Shall we talk about trees? This post is about my new
holiday hobby: hallucinating tree-shaped fractals using our old friend,
gradient descent.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/tree-building.gif" alt="Christmas tree"></p>
<hr>
<p>But — let me start at the beginning. For a variety of reasons, the cover
image of Douglas Hofstadter’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop"><em>I am a Strange
Loop</em></a> has been on my mind
this month. I have been thinking a lot about this wonderful image created by
pointing a camera at a projector that displays what the camera is seeing. In
modern terms: what happens if you screen-share the screen sharing window? This
happens:</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/strange-loop.png" alt="from the cover of the book"></p>
<p>Such “feedback loop” recursions often rapidly converge to breathtaking
fixed-points. The NYC MoMath even has an <a href="https://momath.org/25-feedback-fractals-1/">art
installation</a> that lets you play
with a camera-and-projector setup to make <a href="https://twitter.com/momath1/status/824740594564075520">wonderful
patterns</a>.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there is a mathematical theory here. At risk of ruining the
mystery, I will tell you about it, though without writing any equations. :-)
The theory is the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system">Iterated Function
Systems</a>, which is
almost exactly what it sounds like. Start with a set of affine functions
(affine because that’s what camera-projector-systems do) and repeatedly apply
them to a set of points, taking the union at each step. Regardless of where you
start, you will soon end up with a fractal structure which is the fixed point
of the system. Why fractal? —because the self-similarity comes from the
infinitely-nested composition of the affine functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Ifs-construction.png" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<p>There are theorems that ensure convergence towards and uniqueness of this fixed
point in the limit, but… it’s believable enough, don’t you think? Following
your intuition, you can build Sierpinski Triangles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern">Barnsley
Ferns</a> and all sorts of other
beautiful structures using an IFS. I refer you to Section 8.2 of <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop"><em>The
Algorithmic Beauty of Plants</em> by Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer (yes, <em>that</em>
Lindenmayer)</a> for more botanical
connections.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Fractal_fern_explained.png" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now here is the question that has been on my mind: if I give you a picture of a
fractal-fern, can you give me a set of affine functions whose fixed point is
that fern? This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system#The_inverse_problem"><em>inverse
problem</em></a>
for IFSes. According to Wikipedia, this problem has real-world applications in
image compression, but it is <em>hard</em> to do in general.</p>
<p>Hmm. Interesting. Can our favorite tool, gradient descent, come to the rescue?
At least in an approximate sense? Recall that a two-dimensional affine function
is really just a 3x3 matrix (with 6 free parameters) that encodes the details
of the transformation. If we could easily compute images of IFS fixed points
from a set of matrices, then perhaps we could try to optimize the parameters of
these matrices to make the fixed point look the way we want it to.</p>
<p>The challenge, of course, is efficiently <em>finding</em> the fixed point —
repeatedly rasterizing and compositing affine transformations on images sounds
expensive — and doing so differentiably sounds like a scalability nightmare!
But there is a wonderful solution to this problem, which is to play the
so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game">chaos game</a>.” Instead of
<em>densely</em> applying all the functions to all the points on the plane, you can
<em>sparsely</em> approximate the fixed point as follows: Start with a point — any
point! — and <em>randomly</em> select one of the affine functions of the IFS and
apply it to the point. Repeat this process with the new point. It turns out
that in the limit, the “trail” left behind by this wandering point converges to
the fixed point of the IFS. (This, too, is a theorem, but again I think it is
believable enough that I will not demand a proof.) This is what the “chaos
game” looks like for the Sierpinski triangle; notice how the salt-and-pepper
spattering of points soon converges boldly into the fractal we know and love
(it’s an animation — stare for a few seconds).</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Sierpinski_chaos_animated.gif" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<p>So here is the plan: we start with a point, and play the chaos game with our
current IFS matrices to obtain a <em>point cloud</em> that stochastically approximates
the fixed-point. Then, we compare this <em>point cloud</em> to our target fern-image
to obtain a “loss.” Finally, we update our IFS matrix parameters to minimize
this loss, until at last the fixed-point converges to the target image. It’s
just “machine learning,” really: we’re learning to play the chaos game!</p>
<p>Here is an outline of the algorithm (with some details elided):</p>
<pre><code># initialize IFS
F = [random_3x3_affine() for _ in range(4)]
o = torch.optim.Adam(F, lr=0.0001)

for step in range(100_000):
    o.zero_grad()
    # start at origin
    v = torch.tensor([0., 0., 1.])

    # play the chaos game once
    trace = []
    for _ in range(200):
          # applying an affine function is just
        # a matrix multiplication!
        v = torch.matmul(random.choice(F), v)
        trace.append(v)

    # treat the trace as a point cloud
    loss = compare(target_image, trace)

    # update parameters
    loss.backward()
    o.step()
</code></pre>
<p>Ah! Actually, there is <em>one</em> detail that I <em>should</em> explain: how do you compare
a point cloud and an image? My idea is to convert the target image to a
<em>second</em> point cloud by uniformly sampling points from it, for example by
rejection-sampling. Then you can compare the two point clouds by the so-called
“chamfer distance,” which is the mean distance from each point to its nearest
neighbor in the opposite point cloud. This is quadratic-time to compute, and
the most expensive part of the whole operation, but with ~100 points in each
set it is quite doable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pedagogical aside: notice that the “trick” here is really a <em>change in
representation.</em> This optimization problem is easier to solve on point clouds
than on raster images! An important lesson, that applies across the
ML-for-graphics domain… and more broadly to all differentiable programming
enterprises.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Remarkably, this zany scheme works quite well! Let’s try it with a heart. (A
heart, because it’s an easy low-entropy shape, but also because it felt
symbolically appropriate in relation to Hofstadter’s broader philosophical
project of souls-within-souls-within-souls.)</p>
<p>When we initialize the system with 4 random affine transformations, the trail
left behind by the chaos game is very unimpressive. The sparsity is because I
simulate only 200 steps of the chaos game for each step of gradient descent —
there’s a tradeoff between noise and computation time, of course, as there is
with any form of SGD.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-samples-early.png" alt="chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Okay. Time to optimize! Here is what it looks like after 100K steps of
optimization with an Adam optimizer (that’s about 40 minutes of wall-time
computation on my old MacBook). It looks pretty good, don’t you think? The
chamfer distance scheme works!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-samples.png" alt="chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Now we can export the four affine matrices out from PyTorch and work out the
“true” fixed point with a more expensive offline computation (for example, by
simulating a few <em>million</em> steps of the chaos game). It looks like this — not
perfect, and indeed quite crayon-scribble-ey, but clearly <em>something</em>
interesting has happened, and the result is convincingly heartlike.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-fractal.png" alt="extended chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Where is the fractal structure hidden in this heart? This needs some
vizualization tooling to see clearly. After a bit of JS-canvas-hacking: here is
a GIF of the heart that reveals its fixed-point structure.
Hearts-in-hearts-in-hearts!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart.gif" alt="Heart"></p>
<p>I will admit to blinking a few times when I first saw this animation play out
in full — I did <em>not</em> expect it to work, and even now I find myself marveling
at this creation? discovery? of a heart encoded in 24 numbers.</p>
<hr>
<p>But it still doesn’t look <em>quite right</em> — the fractalness isn’t <em>obvious</em>.
How come? It’s because our affine transformations stretch and squash the heart
into almost unrecognizable blobs. A final, natural improvement is to force our
affine transformations to be <em>rigid</em>, so that there isn’t any squishing or
skewing in the fractal. This is actually not too bad to implement: the solution
to problems of constraint are typically reparametrizations, and indeed in this
case we can simply reparametrize the matrices in terms of a rotation, an
(isotropic) scale, and a translation. Now we’re down from 6 parameters per
matrix to just 4 — even more magical! The result is a much more “obviously”
fractal-ey fixed point, simply because your eye can more easily pick out the
structural recursion when it is made of rigid motions.</p>
<p>Let’s take it for a — pardon — <em>spin!</em></p>
<p>Since I promised you trees, here is some fractal foliage. The target image was
a picture of a maple leaf! I’d never thought about this before, but indeed a
maple leaf contains within it an echo of the whole tree. (Full disclosure: it
takes a couple of randomized restarts to get a really impressive result — the
low dimensionality of the fractal’s parametrization leads to the same
stuck-in-a-local-optimum woes that differentiable rendering folks face all the
time…)</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/foliage.gif" alt="Leaf"></p>
<p>This one uses just three matrices — experimentally, three matrices tend to be
enough to get really good results, and more just lead to very busy and crowded
fractals. (I don’t know if there is a word for number-of-maps–in-an-IFS, but
let’s call it the IFS’s <em>arity</em>. In this terminology, I like <em>ternary</em> IFSes.)</p>
<p>And finally, since I promised you Christmas trees…</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/christmas-tree.gif" alt="Christmas tree"></p>
<p>This last animation is actually absolutely <em>baffling</em> to me. In part, this is
because of how <em>treelike</em> the fractal turned out — here it is overlayed
against the silhouette I optimized against. Can you imagine this is encoded by
just 12 parameters? Odd.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/christmas-tree-match.png" alt="Tree vs. silhouette"></p>
<p>But even more bafflingly: the actual geometry of the recursion is <em>nothing</em>
like the tree recursion geometry you and I are used to from CS106! Compare the
GIF above to Barnsley’s Fern: while Barnsley turns each full leaf into two
smaller leaves with “semantic” affine maps, this Christmas tree does all sorts
of <em>bizarre</em> uninterpretable cartwheels and somehow almost magically works
itself out in the end. It is mesmerizing to me, …</p></section></article></div>

      Got some hilarious reactions. Gotta share.
    </p><div>

<p>Well, <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support">my last post hit it big</a>. Poor blog had a couple social media death hugs on that day. Gosh, people were fuming about me (supposedly) stating that I would not accept their hand-laced, gold-edged, rose scented bug reports without prior payment. How dare I?! Well, I simply do. </p><figure>

<p>The statement was actually that I ignore support requests from non-customers, <strong>especially</strong> when they come <u>disguised</u> as bugreports in order to avoid my fee. I don’t deliberately delete bug reports from my inbox, I simply risk loosing genuine ones because they are drowned out.</p>

<p>But hey, social media. Fast paced universe. Gotta comment while it’s hot, no time to (properly) read the original article. Some people hold some hilarious opinions, though!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bugs must be fixed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don’t. Have you read the license agreement? Search for the phrase “AS IS”. Every <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> contains it (usually in caps). It means, I am under no obligation to provide any further work and you are not entitled to it.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a simple way to make me owe you a service (and I’m even offering it): put money in my bank account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bug was your fault in the first place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Oh wait. Is this going to be one of those conspiracy theories where I deliberately put bugs into my code in order to make you pay for removing them? Nice idea, but…</p>

<ul>
<li>That plan does not scale. There are only so many bugs I could plant.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs is the most time consuming form of support. I’m making a loss on that (in particular when considering the time required to design a good bug that some<u>one</u> might pay for getting removed).</li>
<li>I gave you the source, that takes the leverage out of my hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice to use my software was yours. The disclaimer that it might not work is in the license agreement. I did not put myself in the position of being your only option to solve the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My bug reports are a work of art, you prick! I spent MY TIME on helping YOU to improve YOUR software!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your bug doesn’t bother me. If it did, I’d have fixed it myself. When submitting a bug report, you are not working for me, you are working for yourself and the user community. The same way I was, when making the original software available free of charge (whether or not you want to do it is entirely your choice, I’m not asking you to). Does your bug report include a patch? If yes, then the problem’s solved for you, if not, then you are expecting me to come up with a fix. That’s a work order, here’s my bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignoring bug reports is stupid!</p>

<p>Why? If I look at the mail, I’ll be tempted to act on it, giving someone a free ride. That’s unfair to those who paid for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I’ll have to pay and get no guarantee that my bug will be fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but you are guaranteed, that I will be listening to you and give you a definitive answer in a timely manner. That’s something you don’t get from public bugtrackers. See the problem here? You base your risk assessment on your experience with developers you don’t pay and who therefore have no incentive to help you. When I take your money, you are a customer.</p>

<p>I don’t care.</p>

<ul>
<li>If some other developer wants to self exploit and thinks his time is only worth cheers, that’s their choice.</li>
<li>If the project(s) you are talking about are mission critical (and are otherwise funded), then yes, running a community support forum is a sensible choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the reason, I don’t tend to jump off bridges, just because someone else does it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You hypocrite! You advertise your software as a solution to MY problem on your website</p>

<p>Part of letting you use my solution is letting you know what problem I solve (by the way, that’s a service, saving you from reading the code in order to figure out what it does - you’re welcome). The conclusion that we both have the same problem was yours to draw. And yes, my software has long since grown beyond my own needs. But guess what, that still doesn’t compel me to work for you for free.</p>

<p>Hey, remember SourceForge? Used to be <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects. Got sold. New owners added shady <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge#Controversies">monetization practices</a>. Developers had a choice: leave and lose your backlinks or stay and have your reputation tarnished.</p>

<p>Hey, remember Github? Used to be <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects. Got sold. New owner is Microsoft! The queen of vendor lock-in and shady monetization practices. Developers had a choice: leave and lose your backlinks or stay and see what Microsoft will pull out of their hat in the coming years.</p>

<p>Hey, do you know Gitlab? It is <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects! <small>Until it will get sold!</small>
</p>

<p>Do you <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/why-not-use-github/">see the pattern here</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You made yourself the sole address for support. At least provide a community support forum!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outsource self-exploitation while eating up the infrastructure cost? Sounds like a plan. <strong>NOT!</strong> Get your ass out of your echo chamber. The idea of community support is one of the big criticisms <strong>against</strong> open source. When people have a problem, they want someone to talk to and they want their problem fixed in a timely manner. They don’t want to sign up for forum accounts and they don’t want to monitor them for weeks in the hopes that some community member might eventually come up with an answer.</p>

<p>When it comes to my software, I’m the most competent person to talk to. So whether I like to or not, people will (try to) contact me. As a developer, that puts a choice on your table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop your spare time being eaten up with tech support by pulling the software.</li>
<li>Start accepting payment and realize that you are now running a business that creates additional overhead cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I made myself the sole address for support. That is the only logical conclusion. If I’m running a business, why should I let it be cannibalized by running a public support forum / bug tracker? That’s just adding infrastructure cost to choke profit.</p>

<p>Offering free support helps your project to grow!</p>

<p>Math wiz ey? Ever tried applying a scaling factor to a project where the expenses exceed the revenue?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should have a donation button instead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great idea! How often do you click those?</p>

<p>Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.</p>

<p>I’m not running a charity and I don’t want your “support”. I want, same as you, being paid for the work I do. I find it utterly dishonest to put my work under an open source license, then spend a ridiculous amount of extra work on guilt tripping my users in order to collect alms.</p>

<p>If the license says, “the software is free to use”, then that’s the deal. You get exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is extra and billable.</p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

<p>Almost none of this will be new to you, but there is value in reminding yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn about things that you are curious about. Seems obvious, but put effort into it.</li>
<li>When you find a book that seems interesting, add it to a list. I use the Audible wish list. For regular books I just buy them on Ebay or Amazon.</li>
<li>If you have a task that takes less than 10 minutes, just do it now.</li>
<li>Keep a list of reminders. I like to set them so they notify me at weekly or monthly intervals.</li>
<li>Don’t take any small excuse as a sign not to work out. If you skip one day, definitely don’t skip the next.</li>
<li>Ordering yourself fun little toys on Ebay that take weeks to arrive is very fun.</li>
<li>Setting up a home desk with good equipment is well worth the cost. Your monitor, chair, keyboard and mouse should be good.</li>
<li>If I start gaming, I don’t sleep enough.</li>
<li>Businesses are hard to start. Try to test an idea before building the whole thing.</li>
<li>Go on walks.</li>
<li>Give away things you don’t really like.</li>
<li>Gigabit internet is not worth it. You won’t notice the difference between that and 300-500 Mbps. Save yourself the money.</li>
<li>Have a computer you really like to use, opting for a chromebook leads to much less productivity.</li>
<li>The point of creating an audience is to get feedback. Twitter or karma are not meaningless.</li>
<li>You won’t get an opposing opinion if you don’t seek it out.</li>
<li>Make sure the thing you are buying doesn’t charge via micro-usb.</li>
<li>Do small programming projects. It will help you learn and it’s a great creative outlet.</li>
<li>People who are good writers or speakers have put a lot of effort into it.</li>
<li>Life is unpredictable, make sure you spend it with people you love.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what <a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/">Arjun Guha</a> and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                                <p>Even a few minutes of research into the best journals and notebooks will yield a recommendation for the Traveler’s Notebook. The universal love of this notebook system makes it clear that this is one of the most unique stationery products sold today as well as being one of the one’s people are simply obsessed with.</p>
<p>So, what’s the deal with the Traveler’s Notebook?</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMxJPZN5hqE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Background">Traveler’s Notebook Background</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is made by the Traveler’s Company. This company is based in the&nbsp;Nakameguro section of Tokyo, Japan but the notebooks are sold all over the place, from an official company store at the Narita Airport (also in Tokyo) to paper stores all over the world. The notebooks and accessories are also sold many places online, including <a href="https://amzn.to/3gVgJAB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, and nearly ever premium stationery retailer.</p>
<p>The notebook might seem like something that has been made for dozens of years — a wonderful throwback to the pre-computer era — but that’s not the case. The standard Traveler’s notebook has been sold since 2006 and the smaller passport size first went on sale in 2010. The company that makes the Traveler’s notebook was original called Midori, but the name was changed to the “Traveler’s Company” in 2015.</p>
<p>The parent company of the Traveler’s Company as well as Midori Paper is Designphil Inc., which has been in existence since 1950 when it was formed under the name Midori Shokai Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>While officially known as the “Traveler’s Notebook” most people refer to the notebook as the “Travelers notebook,” dropping the possessive which seems unnecessary and counter-intuitive.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Basics">Traveler’s Notebook Basics</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is a notebook system, which is to say that there is no canonical “Traveler’s Notebook” but rather endless variations on the company’s notebook system. The basic components are a leather cover, notebook inserts, and then a range of accessories that include rubber bands, pockets, stickers and so forth.</p>
<p>The notebooks are prized for their ability to be refilled, their excellent accessories, and their ability to be incredibly customized so no two Traveler’s notebooks are alike.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Inserts">Traveler’s Notebook Inserts</span></h3>
<p>Each notebook is composed of a leather cover and then inserts. These insert components include:</p>
<ul><li>Covers</li>
<li>Refills</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Accessories</li>
</ul><p>We’ll dig into each type in a bit.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Sizes">Traveler’s Notebook Sizes</span></h3>
<p>The notebooks are sold in two sizes: Regular and Passport. It’s critical to know what cover you have so that you buy the right inserts to fit it. The two sizes are different and are not cross compatible.</p>
<p>The only real difference between the two sizes are their dimensions. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 12.0 x 22.0 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>: 9.8 x 13.4 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
</ul><p>The paper that each notebook uses is different as well. Traveler’s notebook paper has the following dimensions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 11.0 x 21.0 x 0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>:&nbsp;8.9 x 12.4 x&nbsp;0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
</ul><p>The notebooks do not adhere to <a href="https://unsharpen.com/paper-sizes/">standard paper sizes</a>. The closest standard sizes would be B6 for the Regular and B7 for Passport.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Covers">Traveler’s Notebook Covers</span></h2>
<p>The outside of a Traveler’s notebook is a single layer leather cover that is smooth on the outside and suede on the inside. It’s sold in black, brown, dark blue, and a reddish brown, known as “Camel.” The covers are made of a fine leather and they age wonderful, even if you are not particularly careful with them.</p>
<p>The covers lie nearly flat when open and have no branding on them. The main features on the cover are an elastic band that hold it shut and one that holds the inserts in place.</p>
<p>Each leather cover ships in a linen bag that protects it when en route to its own. The cover is prized by buyers but doesn’t have a purpose outside of presentation.</p>
<p>The leather covers are made in Thailand while all the paper is made in Japan.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Refills">Traveler’s Notebook Refills</span></h2>
<p>The refills are the beating heart of the notebook — they are the paper that goes inside. The refills come in Regular and Passport size, just like the covers and use excellent quality Midori paper, which is a major selling point, especially for fountain pen users. The paper does come in a number of varieties.</p>
<p>For the Regular size notebooks these include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong> Lightweight (Tomoe River), Sketch, Craft, Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong> Daily, Weekly, Weekly Vertical, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>For Passport the selection is a bit more limited:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong>&nbsp;Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong>&nbsp;Weekly, Weekly Mid-Year Start, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>While the notebooks are not a standard size, competing companies do make compatible notebooks. Some of the top options for these non-Traveler’s refills are Yamamoto with their Ro-Biki refills and Raymay’a A5 Slim refills.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Storage_Options">Traveler’s Notebook Storage Options</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s notebooks are small but mighty, partly because they have options for holding more than just your ideas.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2OdwuGH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Card File</a> is a bit outdated in the era of the iPhone, but it’s use for storing business cards. There is also a Craft Paper Card File that will store more cards than the standard model, or can be used for assorted scraps of paper, stickers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Double-sided stickers are sold to insert photographs, cut out articles, and other mementos. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3iR9knv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Film Pocket Sticker</a> is quite similar, but it’s actually a light plastic sticker that adheres to your notebook or inside a refill and then you can place a photo or piece of paper inside without damaging it. Traveler’s Pocket Stickers are similar but are angled at the top and fully open, so they can used for storing taller items. The Large Pocket Sticker can hole a full photograph or index card on its side.</p>
<p>The most robust storage options are the <a href="https://amzn.to/2W8Dau7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zipper Case</a> and Three-fold File, which can handle larger items and much more of then. The Three-fold File for the standard notebook can even hold a full-sized piece of A4 paper that has been triple-folded (like a you would do to a letter). The Zipper Case can hold ink cartridges, a small pencil sharpener, paper clips, refills or other similar items that won’t fit in a pocket.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Accessories">Traveler’s Notebook Accessories</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s Company loves their accessories… and so do Traveler’s notebook enthusiasts. Some of the accessories include:</p>
<ul><li>Pen holder</li>
<li>Additional elastic bands (known as Connecting Bands)</li>
<li>Plastic Sheet Underlay</li>
<li>Repair Kit (replacement elastic bands)</li>
<li>Refill Binder (for storing refills that are full and no longer needed in your notebook)</li>
<li>Brass charm (for accessorizing the notebook)</li>
<li>Traveler’s Company stickers</li>
</ul><h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Alternatives">Traveler’s Notebook Alternatives</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook might be a distinct thing made by a specific brand, but many other brands have recognized its success and sell similar products. After all, it’s not like the Traveler’s Company was the first to invent a leather notebook cover or to put excellent paper and handy pockets inside of a notebook, journal, folder, or folio!</p>
<p>The main choice with an alternative will be if you want a leather-covered notebook or just a customizable notebook system. Both of these are reasonable ways to define the Traveler’s system, so shop according to your desires for a leather cover, a modular notebook system, or both.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite options for alternatives are:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2ATOyma" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kokuyo Jibun Techo 2020 3 in 1 Set</a></strong></li>
<li>Kokuyo Systemic cover and notebooks</li>
<li>Chic Sparrow Notebook system</li>
<li>Field Notes Everyday Inspiration Leather Cover and memo pads</li>
<li>Bellroy leather notebook cover and notebook inserts</li>
</ul><h2><span id="FAQs">FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Is_there_an_A5_sized_Travelers_Notebook">Is there an A5 sized Traveler’s Notebook?</span></h3>
<p>No, an official Traveler’s notebook in A5 does not exist. Chic Sparrow does sell a similar refillable, leather-covered notebook in A5 as do other, <a href="https://amzn.to/325etCx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lesser known brands</a>, but Traveler’s does not.</p>
<h3><span id="How_do_I_care_for_a_Travelers_Notebook_leather_cover">How do I care for a Traveler’s Notebook leather cover?</span></h3>
<p>The leather cover on a Traveler’s notebook is made to wear in and weather over time. It uses a natural dye that is beautiful but not as tough as some other leather products. The leather should never be washed or cleaned except in the case of a spill where it can be blotted with a damp cloth.</p>
<h3><span id="What_do_I_do_if_the_Travelers_notebook_cover_gets_wet">What do I do if the Traveler’s notebook cover gets wet?</span></h3>
<p>If the leather cover gets wet, you should pat it dry, not rub it, so as to not pull out any of the natural dye. Unnecessary rubbing or friction can pull dye from the leather when it’s wet, so this should be minimized. When as much of the moisture is removed as possible the notebook should be emptied and left to dry in the shade, not out in the sun.</p>
<h3><span id="What_to_do_if_notebooks_cover_has_a_stain_or_blemish">What to do if notebook’s cover has a stain or blemish?</span></h3>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook’s cover was lightly treated exactly so that the cover could wear in. Try to ignore the blemish and continue to use the notebook. Over time it will wear and developer a patina and personality and the blemish will be unnoticeable (or at least well hidden). Unsightly stains and oil spots can be treated carefully with any leather cleaner or leather care cream, though try a small patch first to make sure the natural dye is not affected.</p>

<p>I’m talking to you, Mr. or Mrs. Person who keeps saying “I should really start a blog.” Or maybe it’s more like “I should really post to my poor, lonely blog.”</p>



<p>Yes, you should. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/02/write-5x-more-but-write-5x-less/">I already wrote my manifesto on why</a>, so I won’t repeat it here. But you should. So either <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">do it or stop talking about it</a>.</p>



<p>Stop waiting for motivation, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/18/discipline-eats-motivation-for-breakfast/">use some discipline</a>. Make writing a part of your daily routine.</p>



<p>For me, when I sit down at my desk in the morning I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/18/100-daily-blog-posts/">write a quick blog post</a>. It’s how I ramp up for the day. Maybe that works for you too, and maybe not. But either way, work it into your routine somewhere or it won’t become a habit.</p>



<p>Do it, right now. Schedule it on <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">your calendar</a>. Make a plan. Tell yourself it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">just an experiment</a>, so it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">not scary</a> or permanent.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll be glad you did. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/28/2-months-of-daily-blogging/">I know I am</a>!</p>
