<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fly is a smart, decentralized hosting that allows your application to run faster by assigning virtual machines in the data centers that are located close to your users.  When users connect to your global IPs, Fly dynamically assigns compute powers in datacenters closest to that particular user’s location, contrary to solutions globally duplicating resources in every datacenter near where your customers are. So basically Fly is a solution allowing you to run Docker images on servers in many different cities and a global router connecting users to the nearest available instance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location-Smart</strong> - when a user connects to a Fly application, the system determines the nearest location for the lowest latency and starts the application there.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-scaling</strong> - with Fly new instances are being created as more connections appear at a specific location,</li>
<li><strong>Agile</strong> - your applications adjust to users’ demand, relocating power to the locations where demand is expected to be higher,</li>
</ul>
<h2>GraphQL Server example with Fly</h2>
<p>Creators of <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">Fly provided an example presenting the performance benefits</a> coming from using their service combined with a global Redis cache and Apollo Server. These three technologies power a GraphQL server able to perform queries super efficiently.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a query arrives at the Apollo Server, it is being filtered through the set of defined GraphQL types and being matched with corresponding resolvers. </li>
<li>When a REST query is executed, the server will respond with a JSON containing the requested data and cache the results (if it was configured to do so). Next incoming queries will be checked if the server already has cached results ready to be served.</li>
<li>The app creates the RedisCache (either locally or using Fly’s global Redis service), environment variables with a connection string to the server. The last step is the creation of an Apollo Server using provided configurations so it could start listening for incoming requests.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/fly-decentralized-graphql-server/fly.io">Fly</a> offers significant performance improvement over traditional hosting. Here are some sample results of the response times test performed for this example app. As you can see results when being hosted on Fly looks much better than results of requests made to the Open Library API directly:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Request Method</th>
<th>Test 1</th>
<th>Test 2</th>
<th>Test 3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Open Library API</td>
<td>2.06s</td>
<td>1.70s</td>
<td>1.24s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fly.io (uncached)</td>
<td>1.01s</td>
<td>1.03s</td>
<td>2.27s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fly.io (cached)</td>
<td>0.13s</td>
<td>0.11s</td>
<td>0.09s</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5>Source: <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">github.com/fly-examples</a></h5>
<p>The above results were possible thanks to requests being served from the node located closest to the user’s querying for data, as well as using Redis to cache responses. After the first request made to a specific location Redis will keep data live for approximately an hour, so the next matching requests being sent to this location could be served significantly faster.</p>
<p>If you are still skeptical just visit the example app page on <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">GitHub</a>. There is a detailed instruction provided on how to deploy it using Fly so you could test it yourself. </p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="abstract"><div><h6><i></i> Abstract</h6><p>Risk-based Authentication (RBA) is an adaptive security measure that improves the security of password-based authentication by protecting against credential stuffing, password guessing, or phishing attacks. RBA monitors extra features during login and requests for an additional authentication step if the observed feature values deviate from the usual ones in the login history. In state-of-the-art RBA re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with a numerical code in its body, which must be entered on the online service. Although this procedure has a major impact on RBA's time exposure and usability, these aspects were not studied so far.</p><p>We introduce two RBA re-authentication variants supplementing the de facto standard with a link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present the results of a between-group study (N=592) to evaluate these three approaches. Our observations show with significant results that there is potential to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing neither its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based re-authentication via "magic links", however, makes users significantly more anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived for the first time. Our evaluations underline the fact that RBA re-authentication is not a uniform procedure. We summarize our findings and provide recommendations.</p></div></div></div>]]>

              <p>Navigating in the ocean of Haskell possibilities is challenging even though Haskell is a powerful language that helps to implement robust and maintainable programs. The language supplies you with tons of awesome approaches, but it is not always trivial to see how and where to use them properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like any other mainstream programming language, Haskell also has its best-practices and recommended ways for producing high-quality code. Knowing Haskell programming patterns helps you create better libraries and applications and make their users more pleased. And, yes, Haskell actually has FP-oriented programming patterns in addition to the best-practices shared with other languages.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the best ways to solve common problems, you can become a better Haskell developer by using more efficient programming techniques specific to the language. Likewise, you can apply Haskell-specific patterns successfully outside of Haskell.</p>
<p>This blog post contains a structured collection of some programming mini-patterns in Haskell with the detailed description and examples, some small “quality of life” improvements that would help everyone on their developer journey.</p>
<p>📚 In this article, each pattern contains at least one task with the hidden solution, so you can test your understanding of a pattern by solving the proposed task.</p>
<h2 id="newtype">Newtype<a href="#newtype">🔗</a></h2>
<div>

<p>Newtype</p>

<p>Lightweight data wrapper.</p>

<p>When using the same primitive type (<code>Int</code>, <code>Text</code>, etc.) to represent semantically different entities (name, title, description, etc.).</p>

<div>

<li>Improves maintainability.</li>
<li>Increases code readability.</li>
<li>Enables writing custom instances.</li>
<li>Allows reusing instance definitions with <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#deriving-via">DerivingVia</a>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Additional wrapping and unwrapping.</li>
<li>Deriving boilerplate is required to duplicate existing behaviour of the underlying type.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most common and useful Haskell features is <code>newtype</code>. <code>newtype</code> is an ordinary data type with the name and a constructor. However, you can define a data type as <code>newtype</code> instead of <code>data</code> only if it has <strong>exactly</strong> one constructor with <strong>exactly</strong> one field.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to define a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell as no extra effort is required from the user compared to the data type declaration. For example, the following are the valid <code>newtype</code> definitions:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- + Valid definition of a wrapper around Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>-- + Also valid newtype definition with the record field</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=</span> <span>Size</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    {<span> unSize ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But you can’t declare the following data types as a <code>newtype</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- - Invalid newtype definition: more than 1 field</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    {<span> pointX ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    ,<span> pointY ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    }</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- - Ivalid newtype definition: more than 1 constructor</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>newtype</span> <span>Shape</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">    <span>=</span> <span>Circle</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">    <span>|</span> <span>Square</span> <span>Double</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>newtype</code>s have a lot of great benefits but I’m going to focus only on the <em>code maintainability</em> in this section.</p>
<p>You can think of a <code>newtype</code> as a lightweight data type. Newtype has the same representation in memory as the wrapped type. Wrapping and unwrapping are also free operations in runtime. So, <code>newtype</code> is a <strong>zero-cost</strong> abstraction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding from the compiler point of view, different <code>newtype</code>s are different data types. And since they don’t have any runtime overhead compared to the ordinary data types, you can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Shall we look at the example now. Consider, that you have a function which takes a password, a hash and verifies whether the given hash is the hash of the given password. Since both password and hash are merely textual data, we could write the following function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this function is that you can easily pass arguments in a different order and get faulty results. And you need to think about proper order of arguments each time you are calling this function. Should it be <code>validateHash password hash</code> or <code>validateHash hash password</code>? This approach is error-prone.</p>
<p>But if you define the following <code>newtype</code>s instead:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    {<span> unPassword ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    }</span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>PasswordHash</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">    {<span> unPasswordHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can implement a more type-safe version of the <code>validateHash</code> function, and additionally this improves the code readability:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>Password</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, <code>validateHash hash password</code> is a compile-time error, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias (which is simply another name for a data type) by using the <code>type</code> keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution since it helps only a developer, not the compiler as the compiler doesn’t see the difference between type alias and type itself. And if you don’t help your compiler, the compiler won’t be there for you when you need it.</p>
<p>For example, the following code is flawed:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Attack</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>type</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>calculateDamage ::</span> <span>Attack</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Attack</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the above type signature is better than <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, but the compiler sees it exactly like this. So, you still can write <code>calculateDamage monsterDefense playerAttack</code> and get a runtime bug.</p>
<p>The approach of using <code>type</code>s instead of <code>newtype</code> can bring even more damage when you have a lot of similar data types. The more types you have the harder to maintain them without external help. Below you can see a code sample from one of the Haskell libraries:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The library safety can be improved by replacing all these type aliases with <code>newtype</code>s, and it can even help to discover some bugs that happen due to passing arguments in the wrong order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <code>newtype</code> approach is more flexible since you can provide your custom instances or restrict some instances allowing you to create values in an unsafe way.</p>
<p>The cost of using <code>newtype</code> is small — you only need to wrap and unwrap it when necessary. But the benefits hugely outweigh this small price.</p>

<p>Smart constructor</p>

<p>Providing idiomatic ways for constructing values.</p>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a data type restricts some values (e.g.&nbsp;not every <code>ByteString</code> is a valid <code>Password</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to make construction of big data types easier.</li>
<li>To avoid runtime errors.</li>
<li>To make illegal states unrepresentable.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>More structured and maintainable code.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Some extra code.</li>
<li>Decide on the approach details.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have a <code>newtype</code>, first you need to create its value to work with it. And sometimes you want to validate a value before proceeding with it. Usually you would create a value of a data type by using its constructor. However, when programming in a modular way, you want to have boundaries in your interface and avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.</p>
<p>This programming pattern in Haskell is called <strong>smart constructor</strong>. It can be understood better by looking at the implementation of such approach based on the <code>Password</code> data type:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>module</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">    ( <span>Password</span> (unPassword)</span>
<span id="cb10-3">    , mkPassword</span>
<span id="cb10-4">    ) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><span>import</span> <span>Data.Byte…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

This means that US companies operating in the EU no longer enjoy the automatic right to transfer EU citizens’ data into the US. The fundamental reason is a conflict between the EU’s strong data protection rights (à la </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><span>GDPR</span></a><span>) and the US’s strong national security needs. While Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) were still ruled valid, the Schrems II ruling sent cross-Atlantic cloud computing into long-term uncertainty: Will EU data eventually need to stay inside the EU’s border, perhaps even under EU judicial control?</span></p><p><span>These issues are not new to our customers. Even before Schrems II, national sentiments required some of our customers to keep data within a certain country. Others made it a Unique Selling Point (USP) to outperform required regulation and keep data geographically close to their users. Moreover, some healthcare companies need to run their application both on-premise and as a SaaS, depending on their evaluation of shared responsibility. </span><b>These use-cases highlight the need for a cloud-agnostic or even multi-cloud strategy.</b></p><h2>How can Kubernetes help?</h2><p><span>Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies promise to decouple the underlying infrastructure from the application. Thus, it should be trivial to move a Cloud Native application between public clouds to private clouds or even bare-metal servers.</span></p><blockquote><p><i><span>“Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.” (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)</span></i></p></blockquote><p><span>However, this application-side simplicity pushes the complexity of dealing with the infrastructure onto Kubernetes in two ways. First, under the hood, Kubernetes needs to be packaged and configured with a specific </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/"><span>cloud provider</span></a><span>, a component that abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, e.g., how to mount a Persistent Volume. Second, as the saying goes, “Kubernetes is a powerful engine, but you still need to build a car around it”. Each major cloud provider, such as AWS, Google or Azure, provides their own Kubernetes distribution. Said distribution is tightly integrated with the provider’s identity access management, container registry and logging solution. Other Kubernetes distributions are slightly less coupled to provider-specific services, but are still focused on major US cloud providers.</span></p><h2>So does staying in the EU mean no Kubernetes?</h2><p><span>Of course not! Kubernetes can be configured not only to run on private clouds built on top of OpenStack, CloudStack or VMware, but also on bare-metal servers. Provider-specific services can be replaced with open-source solutions, such as </span><a href="https://github.com/dexidp"><span>Dex</span></a><span> for identity management, </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/"><span>Elasticsearch</span></a><span> for logging, </span><a href="https://prometheus.io/"><span>Prometheus</span></a><span> for metrics and alerting, and </span><a href="https://goharbor.io/"><span>Harbor</span></a><span> for container registry.</span></p><p><span>Carefully integrating all these components can lead to a Kubernetes setup that is truly cloud agnostic. The engineering team gets the same experience, no matter if the application runs on a big US cloud provider or on a quality EU cloud provider. Even if the current plan is to run in a single cloud, a cloud agnostic strategy reduces uncertainty, by facilitating a future migration to a different cloud provider or a future multi-cloud setup.</span></p><p><span>With even more care, the Kubernetes setup can pass stringent requirements of regulated industries, such as healthcare. For example, Harbor can be configured with integrated image vulnerability scanning. OpenPolicyAgent can be added to enforce policies, such as container images should only be downloaded from the local Harbor. Finally, Elasticsearch can run in a separate environment for tamper-proof logging.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, doing all these from scratch can become a time consuming and costly adventure.</span></p><h2>Compliant Kubernetes</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison.png" alt="" width="2584" height="1463" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison.png 2584w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-300x170.png 300w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-1024x580.png 1024w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-1536x870.png 1536w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-2048x1160.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2584px) 100vw, 2584px"></p><p><span>To help our customers run their application effortlessly across multiple clouds, Elastisys developed Compliant Kubernetes. The distribution supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, OpenStack and CloudStack, with Azure and VMware to come. It also comes fully equipped with identity, tamper-proof logging, vulnerability scanning and backups. Together with many other features, it significantly reduces the compliance burden for regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA.</span></p><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes is available as open source software, with Elastisys providing support. In addition, Elastisys partnered with many EU cloud providers, such as </span><a href="https://www.exoscale.com/"><span>Exoscale</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.safespring.com/"><span>SafeSpring</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://citycloud.com/"><span>CityCloud</span></a><span>, to offer Compliant Kubernetes as a managed service. A managed service is desirable for allowing in-house resources to focus on core business development.</span></p><p><span>In brief, Compliant Kubernetes is a single Kubernetes distribution that allows the same application to run in multiple clouds. A multi-cloud or cloud-agnostic strategy is an effective solution for uncertainty around the future implications of Schrems II, and the fall of PrivacyShield.</span></p><p><a href="https://elastisys.com/contact-form/">Contact us</a> to find out more!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

</p><p>Prof.&nbsp;Akiyoshi Kitaoka makes images using the so-called “Popple illusion”. Using phase-shifted Gabor patches, these illusions cause your visual system to misinterpret concentric circles as non-concentric or even as spirals.</p><p>I love research papers that use illusions to reverse engineer our visual system. It’s cool to think that, as recently as the year 2000, we’re finding new and intriguing visual illusions that teach us something about our brain.

There will be some innovation and a few compromises, but this combination may pave the way for new and ingenious content.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>As with Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/">previous portable console</a>, the system revolves around a big chip named <strong>CPU NTR</strong>. ‘NTR’ is shorthand for ‘Nitro’, the codename of the original Nintendo DS.</p><p>Now, CPU NTR implements an interesting multi-processor architecture using two different ARM CPUs, this design was done before ARM Holdings officially released multi-processor solutions. So, their functioning may be considered a bit unorthodox taking into account the present technology available.</p><p>While this is not the first parallel system analysed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/">this series</a>, its design is very different from the rest. For instance, we are not talking about the ‘experimental’ master-slave configuration that the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Saturn</a> debuted or the ‘co-processor’ approach found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/">PS1</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nintendo-64/">N64</a>. The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

It still includes all its original features (especially <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>).</p><p>Now for the changes: Because Nintendo’s engineers placed the ARM7 next to most of the I/O ports, this CPU will be tasked with arbitrating and assisting I/O operations. In fact, no other processor can directly connect to the I/O. As you can see, this is not the ‘main’ processor that will be in charge of the system, but rather the ‘sub-processor’ offloading the main CPU by passing data around many components.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s"><h4>ARM946E-S</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm9_core.213329ca27287083c84d30b27fb9da63edd81998406a10b9ee7289089d0fe94d.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU. Combined with the use of cache, both CPU and DMA can potentially work concurrently.<ul><li>Cache and DMA can provide a lot of performance but also create new problems, such as data integrity. So programmers will have to manually maintain memory consistency by flushing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation-2/#preventing-past-mishaps">write-buffer</a> before triggering DMA, for instance.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><p>I guess with hardware like this, it’s easy to figure out the <em>real</em> reason kids loved this console, eh?</p><h4 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h4><p>So far I’ve talked about how the two CPUs work individually. But to work as a whole, they require to co-operate constantly. To accomplish this, both CPUs directly ‘talk’ to each other using a dedicated <strong>FIFO unit</strong>, this block of data holds two 64-byte queues (up to 16 elements) for <strong>bi-directional communication</strong>.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/fifo.4c452b5f9236fb1e98454d2f90d2cab902ee4c561e165e8eaf8a8fc0cd7a05f4.png"><picture>

Alternatively, an <strong>interrupt unit</strong> can be activated to notify the receiver whenever there’s a new value in the queue.</p><h4 id="main-memory">Main memory</h4><p>Just like its predecessor, RAM is spread around many different locations, enabling to prioritise data placement by speed of access. In summary, we have the following general-purpose memory available:</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/ram.99e9bd12e464182ef51ea4aa89a7fc60323a46a72550afbacd737957372cf190.png"><picture>

Therefore, behaving like SRAM (the faster, but more expensive alternative to DRAM). This design reminds me of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">1T‑SRAM</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h4><p>Even though the architecture is significantly different from its predecessor, it still managed to maintain the critical bits that would grant it native compatibility with GameBoy Advance games.</p><p>But for the DS to revert to an ‘internal’ GBA, the former includes a set of software routines that set the console in <strong>AGB Compatibility Mode</strong>. In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger). Moreover, since the DS has two screens, users can set which screen will be used to display the GBA game.</p><p>Once in GBA mode <strong>there’s no going back</strong>, the console must be reset to re-activate the rest of the hardware.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and limitations</h4><p>With so many sophisticated components fitted in a single and inexpensive chip, it’s no mystery that some issues emerged due to the way they were forced to work with each other.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-unused-power-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-unused-power">Unused Power</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">A question about the hardware choice</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-unused-power"><h4>Unused Power</h4><p>Sometimes I wonder how Nintendo planned the way the two CPU’s would be used, and if they already assumed some performance would be hit by the design they chose.</p><p>Let me start with the ARM9, this CPU runs at twice the speed of the ARM7, but most (if not all) of the I/O depends on the ARM7, so the ARM9 is vulnerable to excessive stalling until the ARM7 answers. If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block). On the other hand, this penalty (as some sources call it) can be alleviated by making full use of cache and TCM.</p><p>All in all, this means that in the worst case, the ‘whooping’ ARM9’s 66 MHz horsepower is practically reduced to a mere ~8&nbsp;MHz. That is if the program makes an abysmal use of cache/TCM.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice"><h4>A question about the hardware choice</h4><p>Back when I read about the CPU of the GameBoy Advance, I was really surprised by the potential of the ARM7: The CPU not only performed its designated tasks, but could also assist with others, such as providing audio sequencing or pseudo-3D graphics.</p><p>Now, during the commercialisation ARM7, ARM Holdings joined forces with DEC to design a high-end version of ARM’s chips. For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>This section is a bit unusual because not only this console has multiple screens to draw, but also a combination of traditional tile engines working …</p></div></div></div>

</span></p><p>Push notifications are everywhere, from news and messenger apps to fitness and health applications. They are a great tool for increasing user
engagement, having a click rate that is <a href="https://blog.e-goi.com/infographic-push-notification">7 times higher than that of email marketing</a>.
But be careful not to send too many irrelevant notifications. As <a href="https://uplandsoftware.com/localytics/resources/blog/the-inside-view-how-consumers-really-feel-about-push-notifications/">this report shows</a>,
50% of app users find push notifications annoying.</p><p>With that being said, in this tutorial, I'll show you how to create your own web push notifications,
using <strong>your own backend with NodeJS and TypeScript</strong>, and vanilla <strong>JavaScript on the frontend</strong>.</p><p>I'll go through all the steps you need to take to set up the backend and frontend, but you can skip those parts of course if you're
interested in adding push notifications to an existing project.</p><blockquote><p>I uploaded the final code to this <a href="https://github.com/fgerschau/web-push-notification-example">GitHub repository</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="what-you-will-learn"><a href="#what-you-will-learn" aria-label="what you will learn permalink"></a>What you will learn</h3><p>I'll briefly explain what you need to know about web push notifications before diving into the tutorial, where we'll build a full-stack web application

</span></p><p>Web push notifications are notifications that the user receives through the browser. These notifications were previously exclusive to native
web and desktop applications, but can now be used by websites as well.</p><p>To receive a web push notification, the user doesn't need to have the browser or the website open, thanks to the

    <main role="main">

        
        
<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/header.png">
</p>

<p>
The way I was taught x86 assembly at the university had been completely outdated for many years by the time I had my first class. It was around 2008 or 2009, and 64-bit processors had already started becoming a thing even in my neck of the woods. Meanwhile, we were doing DOS, real-mode, memory segmentation and all the other stuff from the bad old days.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I picked up enough of it during the classes (and over the subsequent years) to be able to understand the stuff coming out of the other end of a compiler, and that has helped me a few times. However, I've never manually written any substantial amount of x86 assembly for something non-trivial. Due to being locked up inside (on account of a global pandemic), I decided to change that situation, to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to focus on x86-64 specifically, and completely forget/skip any and all legacy crap that is no longer relevant for this architecture. After getting a bit deeper into it, I also decided to publish my notes in the form of tutorials on this blog since there seems to be a desire for this type of content.
</p>

<p>
Everything I write in these posts will be a normal, 64-bit, Windows program. We'll be using Windows because that is the OS I'm running on all of my non-work machines, and when you drop down to the level of writing assembly it starts becoming incresingly impossible to ignore the operating system you're running on. I will also try to go as "from scratch" as possible - no libraries, we're only allowed to call out to the operating system and that's it.
</p>

<p>
In this first, introductory part (yeah, I'm planning a series and I know I will regret this later), I will talk about the tools we will need, show how to use them, explain how I generally think about programming in assembly and show how to write what is perhaps the smallest viable Windows program.
</p>

<h2>Getting the Tools</h2>
<p>There are two main tools that we will use throughout this series.</p>

<h3>Assembler</h3>

<p>
CPUs execute machine code - an efficient representation of instructions for the processor that is almost completely impenetrable to humans. The assembly language is a human-readable representation of it. A program that converts this symbolic representation into machine code ready to be executed by a CPU is called an <b>assembler</b>.
</p>

<p>
There is no single, agreed-upon standard for x86-64 assembly language. There are many assemblers out there, and even though some of them share a great deal of similarities, each has its own set of features and quirks. It is therefore important which assembler you choose. In this series, we will be using 
<a href="http://flatassembler.net/">Flat Assembler</a> (or FASM for short). I like it because it's small, easy to obtain and use, has a nice macro system and comes with a handy little editor.</p>

<h3>Debugger</h3>

<p>
Another important tool is the debugger. We'll use it to examine the state of our programs. While I'm pretty sure it's possible to use Visual Studio's integrated debugger for this, I think a standalone debugger is better when all you want to do is look at the disassembly, memory and registers. I've always used <a href="http://ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a> for stuff like that, but unfortunately it does not have a 64-bit version. Therefore we will be using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windbg-preview/9pgjgd53tn86?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">WinDbg</a>. The version linked here is a revamp of this venerable tool with a slightly nicer interface. Alternatively, you can get the non-Windows-store version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">here</a> as part of the Windows 10 SDK. Just make sure you deselect everything else besides WinDbg during installation. For our purposes, the two versions are mostly interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Thinking in Assembly</h2>

<p>
Now that we have our tools, I want to spend a bit of time to discuss some basics. For the purpose of these tutorials I'm assuming some knowledge of languages like C or C++, but little or no previous exposure to assembly, therefore many readers will find this stuff familiar.
</p>
<h3>A 10000-foot view</h3>
<p>
CPUs only "know" how to do a fixed number of certain things. When you hear someone talk about an "instruction set", they're referring to the set of things a particular CPU has been designed to do, and the term "instruction" just means "one of the things a CPU can do". Most instructions are parameterized in one way or another, and they're generally really simple. Usually an instruction is somthing along the lines of "write a given 8-bit value to a given location in memory", or "interpreting the values from registers A and B as 16-bit signed integers, multiply them and record the result into register A".
</p>

<p>
Below is a simple mental model of the architecture that we'll start with.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/diag0.png">
</p>

<p>
 This skips a <i>ton</i> of things (there can be more than one core executing instructions and reading/writing memory, there's different levels of cache, etc. etc.), but should serve as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
 To be effective at low-level programming or debugging you need to understand that every high-level concept eventually maps to this low-level model, and learning how the mapping works will help you.
</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>
 You can think of <b>registers</b> as a special kind of memory built right into the CPU that is very small, but extremely fast to access. There are many different kinds of registers in x86-64, and for now we'll concern ourselves only with the so-called <i>general-purpose</i> registers, of which there are sixteen. Each of them is 64 bits wide, and for each of them the lower byte, word and double-word can be addressed individually (incidentally, 1 "word" = 2 bytes, 1 "double-word" = 4 bytes, in case you haven't heard this terminology before).

<p>Additionally, the higher 8 bits of <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, <code>rcx</code> and <code>rdx</code> can be referred to as <code>ah</code>, <code>bh</code>, <code>ch</code> and <code>dh</code>.</p>

<p>
Note that even though I said those were "general-purpose" registers, some instructions can only be used with certain registers, and some registers have special meaning for certain instructions. In particular, <code>rsp</code> holds the stack pointer (which is used by instructions like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>call</code> and <code>ret</code>), and <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> serve as source and destination index for "string manipulation" instructions. Another example where certain registers get "special treatment" are the multiplication instructions, which require one of the multiplier values to be in the register <code>rax</code>, and write the result into the pair of registers <code>rax</code> and <code>rdx</code>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these registers, we will also consider the special registers <code>rip</code> and <code>rflags</code>. <code>rip</code> holds the address of the next instruction to execute. It is modified by control flow instructions like <code>call</code> or <code>jmp</code>. <code>rflags</code> holds a bunch of binary flags indicating various aspects of the program's state, such as whether the result of the last arithmetic operation was less, equal or greater than zero. The behavior of many instructions depends on those flags, and many instructions update certain flags as part of their execution. The flags register can also be read and written "wholesale" using special instructions.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot more registers on x86-64. Most of them are used for SIMD or floating-point instructions, and we'll not be considering them in this series.
</p>

<h3>Memory and Addresses</h3>

<p>
You can think of memory as a large array of byte-sized "cells", numbered starting at 0. We'll call these numbers "memory addresses". Simple, right?
</p>
<p>
Well... addressing memory used to be rather annoying back in the old days. You see, registers in old x86 processors used to be only 16-bit wide. Sixteen bits is enough to address 64 kilobytes worth of memory, but not more. The hardware was actually capable of using addresses as wide as 20 bits, but you had put a "base" address into a special segment register, and instructions that read or wrote memory would use a 16-bit offset into that segment to obtain the final 20-bit "linear" address. There were separate segment registers for code, data and stack portions (and a few more "extra" ones), and segments could overlap. 
</p>
<p>
In x86-64 these concerns are non-existant. The segment registers for code, data and stack are still present, and they're loaded with some special values, but as a user-space programmer you needn't concern yourself with them. For all intents and purposes you can assume that all segments start at 0 and extend for the entire addressable length of memory. So, as far as we're concerned, on x86-64 our programs see memory as a "flat" contiguous array of bytes, with sequential addresses, starting at 0, just like we said in the beginning of this section...
</p>
<p>
Okay, I may have distorted the truth a little bit. Things aren't quite as simple. While it is true that on 64-bit Windows your programs see memory as a flat contiguous array of bytes with addresses starting at 0, it is actually an elaborate illusion maintained by the OS and CPU working together.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, if you were really able to read and write any byte in memory willy-nilly, you'd stomp all over other programs' code and data (something that indeed could happen in the Bad Old Days). To prevent that, special protection mechanisms exist. I won't get too deep into their inner workings here because this stuff matters mostly for OS developers. Nevertheless, here's a very short overview:
</p>
<p>
Each process gets a "flat" address space as described above (we'll call it the "virtual address space"). For each process, the OS sets up a <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging">mapping</a> between its virtual addresses and actual physical addresses in memory. This mapping is respected by the hardware: the "virtual" addresses get translated to physical addresses dynamically at runtime. Thus, the same address (e.g. 0x410F119C) can map to two different locations in physical memory for two different processes. This, in a nutshell, is how the separation between processes in enforced.
</p>

<p>
The final thing I want to invite your attention to here is how the instructions and data which they operate on are held in the same …</p></main></div></div>

<p>It seems impossible, however, thanks to a particular initiative that is becoming more and more popular, this can become a reality.

<p>This unprecedented proposal has struggled initially, but it’s gaining popularity in recent times. This long-term strategy is attractive for those who are looking for low-cost real estate investments in Italy, and to simply restore prestige to Italian villages famous all over the world for their extraordinary beauty, and for that vintage spirit so cherished nowadays.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the repopulation of these small villages also promotes tourist activities, regenerating the economy of the entire area.

<p><span>Despite the buzz around GPT-3, it is, in and of itself, not AGI.</span> In many ways, this makes it similar to AlphaGo or Deep Blue; while approaching human ability in one domain (playing Chess/Go, or writing <em>really</em> impressively), it doesn’t really seem like it will do <span><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Intelligence_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scary AGI Things™</a></span> any more than AlphaGo is going to be turning the Earth into paperclips anytime soon. While its writings are impressive at emulating humans, GPT-3 (or any potential future GPT-x) has no memory of past interactions, nor is it able to follow goals or maximize utility. However, language modelling has one <em>crucial</em> difference from Chess or Go or image classification. Natural language essentially encodes information about the world—the <em>entire</em> world, not just the world of the Goban, in a much more expressive way than any other modality ever could.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> By harnessing the world model embedded in the language model, it may be possible to build a proto-AGI.</p>

<p>The explicit goal of a language model is only to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize likelihood</a> of the model on natural language data. In the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">autoregressive formulation</a> that GPT-3 uses, this means being able to predict the next word as well as possible. However, this objective places much more weight on large, text-scale differences like grammar and spelling than fine, subtle differences in semantic meaning and logical coherency, which reflect as very subtle shifts in distribution. Once the former are near-perfect, though, the only place left to keep improving is the latter.</p>
<p>At the extreme, any model whose loss reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shannon entropy</a> of <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/information-theory/entropy_of_english_9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language</a>—the theoretical lowest loss a language model can possibly achieve, due to the inherent randomness of language—will be <em>completely indistinguishable</em> from writings by a real human in every way, and the closer we get to it, the more abstract the effect on quality of each bit of improvement in loss. Or, said differently, stringing words together using <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markov chain generators</a> gets you 50% of the way there, figuring out grammar gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, staying on topic across paragraphs gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, being logically consistent gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, and so on.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mo>[</mo><mi>log</mi><mi mathvariant="double-struck">P</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>]</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><msub><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mi>log</mi><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p><span>Shannon Entropy: the number of bits necessary, on average to specify one piece of text.</span></p>
<p>Why? Because if you have a coherent-but-not-logically consistent model, becoming more logically consistent helps you predict language better. Having a model of human behavior helps you predict language better. Having a model of the world helps you predict language better. As the low-hanging fruits of grammar and basic logical coherence are taken, the only place left for the model to keep improving the loss is a world model. Predicting text is <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/rationale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equivalent to AI</a>.</p>
<p>The thing about GPT-3 that <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">makes it so important</a> is that it provides evidence that as long as we keep increasing the model size, we can keep driving down the loss, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly right up until</a> it hits the Shannon entropy of text. No need for clever architectures or complex handcrafted heuristics. Just by scaling it up we can get a better language model, and a better language model entails a better world model.</p>
<p>But how do we use this language model if it’s buried implicitly-represented inside GPT-x, though? Well, we can literally just <em>ask</em> it, in natural language, what it thinks will happen next given a sequence of events, and its output distribution will approximate the distribution of what the average human thinks would happen next after those events. Great—we’ve got ourselves a usable world model.</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say, “<a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/621186154843324416/all-your-questions-answered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Various</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1284042570507542528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiments</a> have shown that GPT-3 often fails at world modelling, and just conjecturing that adding more parameters will fix the problem is a <em>massive</em> leap!” If you’re thinking this, you’re absolutely correct. The biggest and most likely to be wrong assumption that I’m making is that larger models will develop better world models. Since as loss approaches the Shannon entropy its world modelling ability has to become about as good than the average human on the internet<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, this boils down to two questions: “Will we really make models whose loss gets close enough to the Shannon entropy?” and “How close is close enough, in order to have the world modelling capabilities to make all this practical?”</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Loss keeps going down with more parameters and compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The answer to the first question is “most likely”—that’s the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">main takeaway of GPT-3</a>. The answer to the second question is… nobody knows. Some have demonstrated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23990902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways of making GPT-3 better at world modelling</a>, but this alone is probably not sufficient. When models with 1 trillion, then 10 trillion, then 100 trillion parameters become available, we will have empirical evidence to see whether this assumption is correct. If GPT-x demonstrates uncanny ability to predict outcomes in the real world, then this just might work.</p>

<p>A world model alone does not an agent make, though.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> So what does it take to make a world model into an agent? Well, first off we need a goal, such as <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“maximize number of paperclips”</a>. Then, we just ask the world model “What action can I take to maximize the number of paperclips I have?” Simple, right? Actually, not quite. The problem is that our world model probably won’t be able to consider all the possible things that could happen next well enough to make a reasonable answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mesa.png" alt="GPT-3 considers mesa-optimization. (Source: OpenAI API)"></p>
<p>So what can we do instead? Well, asking the world model for a list of things you could do in a given world state would probably not be outside the capabilities of a sufficiently powerful language model (think: “I am in situation <span>xyz</span>. Here is a list of things I could do:”). Similarly, asking the world model how much reward you’d get in some hypothetical world where you took a sequence of actions would probably be possible too—imagine asking something along the lines of “I go to ebay. I look up paperclips, sorted by price ascending. I spend $100 on the first item on the list. How many paperclips will I have?”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> This will let us figure out what actions the agent can take in any given step (policy function), as well as how much reward each sequence of steps will net the agent (value function).</p>
<p>So now, to estimate the state-action value of any action, we can simply do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> to estimate the state-action values! Starting from a given agent state, we can roll out sequences of actions using the world model. By integrating over all rollouts, we can know how much future expected reward the agent can expect to get for each action it considers. Then, we can simply use, for example, a greedy policy with that state-action value function, to decide on actions to take.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mcts.png" alt="Monte Carlo Tree Search visualized (<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Phases-of-the-Monte-Carlo-tree-search-algorithm-A-search-tree-rooted-at-the-current_fig1_312172859'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Each of these actions is likely to be very high level, such as “figure out the cheapest way to buy paperclips”, but thanks to the flexibility of language we can describe very complex ideas with short sequences of tokens. To actually execute these abstract actions once the agent decides on an action, that action can be broken down using the language model into smaller sub-goals such as “figure out the cheapest paperclips on Amazon”, similar to <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a>. Possibly even just breaking actions down into a detailed list of instructions would be feasible, depending on the capabilities of the model and how abstract the actions are.</p>
<p>We can represent the agent state as natural language, too. Since the agent state is just a compressed representation of the observations, we can ask the language model to summarize the important information of any observations for its own internal world state. The language model could be used to periodically prune (i.e forget) the information inside its state, too, to make room for more observations.</p>
<p>Altogether, this gets us a system where we can pass observations from the outside world in, spend some time thinking about what to do, and output an action in natural language.</p>
<p>To handle input, you could have an input module that turns various modalities of observations into summarized text with respect to the current agent state. For instance, you could use something like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iGPT</a> to input camera images or screenshots, or raw HTML from webpages that the agent requests. How exactly this is done is tangential to the point; all that matters is that somehow the inputs are all converted to text and added to the agent state. The examples I have provided are just to convince you that it’s absolutely not insurmountable.</p>
<p>Finally, to get the model to actually act in the world, you could again use the language model to translate natural language into <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Microsoft/1OyKAYWPRrWKb?t=29m19s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code that is then executed</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shell commands</a>, or sequences of keypresses, or any of a number of other possible ways. Like input, there are an infinitude of different ways to solve the output problem, and which one turns out to be the best is entirely irrelevant to our discussion; all that matters is that it’s possible to get various modalities in and out of the text-only agent.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/paperclipsamzn.png" alt="An example of an input module taking a screenshot input combined with the current agent state to give an observation with the information needed by the agent."></p>

<p>This is more a thought experiment than something that’s actually going to happen tomorrow; GPT-3 today just isn’t good enough at world modelling. Also, this method depends heavily on at least one major assumption—that bigger future models will have much better world modelling capabilities—and a bunch of other smaller implicit assumptions. <strong><span>However</span></strong>, this might be the closest thing we ever get to a chance to <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound the fire alarm</a> for AGI: there’s now a concrete path to proto-AGI that has a non-negligible chance of working.</p>

<!--[^toolai]: One common line of argument is that such "tool AIs" are good enough and have desirable safety properties, and therefore agentistic AI need not ever be developed. One argument against this idea is that [agent AI will inevitably be more economically valuable than tool AI](https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI), which would encourage their development.-->

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a simple [Markov chain generator](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild) makes a *massive* difference, but the loss difference between a Markov chain generator and GPT-2 is much smaller despite GPT-2 being able to manage grammatically correct sentences nearly all of the time, and the loss difference between GPT-2 and GPT-3 is smaller still, despite massive subjective improvements in quality. 

The difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "shxixpgozcvoomz jcxfgabsdcxfrevogjsqewdnmkj" is *massive*, but the difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a model that uses words in the same [Zipf distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) as regular text earns a large decrease in loss, because if you always pick common words like "the" you have a much better chance of being right than picking rare words. Another big decrease comes from considering n-gram frequencies rather than just single-word frequencies; this is the driving idea behind [Markov chain generators](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild), which generate surprisingly good text considering how just how simple they are.

I would like to highlight projects that are widely used, even to the point of being part of critical infrastructure, but are nevertheless small projects with small (often unsponsored) development teams.

<p>dnsmasq is one of the unsung heroes of the Internet: a small piece of software used very widely, but with a <em>very</em> small development team, and no corporate backing. It is used as the <span>DHCP</span> and caching <span>DNS</span> server on a wide variety of home-market routers, as well as other devices, and is the default <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> caching server for libvirt, and by extension, OpenStack. A couple years ago, I contacted Simon Kelley, the author of dnsmasq, and asked if he was up for an interview. He was, but my blog wasn’t in a maintainable position at that point, so it got pushed back. I contacted him again recently, and we managed to make it happen. This interview was conducted via e-mail on December 10,&nbsp;2017.</p>

<p>Simon, thank you for taking time out of your schedule (when you could be
programming) to answer my questions. This is quite an honor, and I hope you
enjoy the&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>What itch were you scratching, that is, what was your original need and
intention for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>

got a second-hand 486 laptop, and discovered that I could connect
that to my <span>PC</span> and give it a net connection too, using this amazing thing
called ip-masquerading (what later became <span>NAT</span>.) But when the Netscape on the
laptop would send the <span>UDP</span> <span>DNS</span> query to the <span>ISP</span>, it would get to the
desktop, where it would evaporate, and Netscape would hang (it was
single-threaded, at least in the <span>DNS</span> code) for a long time-out. I wanted
to fix that annoying behaviour. The <span>IP</span>-masquerade use is where the
DNSmasq name came&nbsp;from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you intend to release it as open source from the&nbsp;beginning?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that I intended to release it,&nbsp;yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much did you know about <span>DNS</span> and <span>DHCP</span> when you&nbsp;started?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost nothing, about the internals anyway. I started with <span>RFC</span> 1035 and
went from&nbsp;there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the most interesting bug you’ve run&nbsp;into?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not one of mine - I found a Linux kernel bug once, in the <span>API</span> to control
the <span>ARP</span> cache. The bug was long-ago fixed, but in a sense, the
work-around still persists in dnsmasq. It was difficult to find because
it was intermittent and hard to reproduce, and it took a long time to
consider that the problem may not have been mine, but in the&nbsp;Kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related: when fixing a bug (found by you or reported), what has been your
most “What was I thinking when I wrote that”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of those. I once found a “&amp;” versus “&amp;&amp;” confusion which nobody
had spotted as a functional error, by code&nbsp;inspection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever found bugs in other <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> products/libraries as a
result of your testing? What was the most interesting one? Feel free to share
others, if you&nbsp;wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are lots of <span>DHCP</span> clients in things like printers and scanners and
general IoT devices which behave badly and need workarounds. Intel
produced some awful bugs in <span>PXE</span> implementations which went into netboot
<span>ROMS</span> and never got&nbsp;updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your most “you’ve got to be kidding me” moment when learning new
corners of <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> and/or your biggest “I wish I had known that when I
started”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always amused me that the format of a <span>DNS</span> packet - which is very
size constrained to fit into <span>UDP</span> packets, wastes 16 bits for a count of
the number of questions in a query. This has been constrained to be
exactly one for all of the life of <span>DNS</span>, so the 16 bits are completely
wasted. <span>DNS</span> in general is an amazingly under-specified and obscure area.
It’s been around forever, and is developed by people who have been
around for a long time and grown up with it. They tend to vastly
underestimate how much implied knowledge they are assuming when writing
RFCs. As for what I wished I’d known: I wished I’d found the <span>RFC</span> which
is an errata  to the original three <span>DNSSEC</span> RFCs earlier; I found several
of the bugs the hard&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your reaction when you found out dnsmasq was used as the default
forwarder/<span>DHCP</span> server for OpenStack? What is it like having your project used
in one the most well known open source projects in the&nbsp;world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That happened after dnsmasq was incorporated into Android, so it was
sort of an anti-climax after getting into the majority of smart phones on
the&nbsp;planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: point&nbsp;taken]</p>
<p>Besides OpenStack, what are some of the most interesting use cases you’ve
heard about for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took some patches from someone who was providing satellite Internet to
trans-oceanic sailors. Bandwidth costs were high enough that it made
sense to audit almost every byte sent and received, including for <span>DNS</span>&nbsp;resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever gotten contributions (code or otherwise) back from router
manufacturers that have used&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably, but I don’t remember anything significant in terms of code.
Comcast paid for a year of my time to implement <span>DNSSEC</span>, which was pretty
good of&nbsp;them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What kind of contributions have you turned&nbsp;down?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s people who make a patch to solve their particular problem and
don’t give any thought to making it general, or generally&nbsp;useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you talk about one significant or difficult contribution you turned down
and why? - From my co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/eduncan911">Eric Duncan&nbsp;@eduncan911</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one that’s happened over and over again is to change the behaviour
on receiving a “no-such-domain” reply from an upstream nameserver.
People want to implement local <span>DNS</span> hacks by getting dnsmasq to keep
trying another upstream server when the first returns <span>NXDOMAIN</span>, but
that’s always seemed to me to be a really bad thing to do: <span>NXDOMAIN</span> is a
valid answer, and not a failure&nbsp;return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a group of steady contributors, or is it pretty much just you
(and occasional&nbsp;contributions)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are steady contributors, but long-term, it’s just&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are pretty active on the mailing list. For the second quarter of 2017,
nearly 80 messages of the 229 are from you. How much time do you spend on the
project (code and helping&nbsp;users)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very variable, and less than I used to. I used to have a job with a very
<span>FOSS</span>-friendly employer. I was sitting in front of computer most days,
and my boss was happy for me to spend time on dnsmasq. Nowadays, I’m
semi-retired, and I spend my days doing other stuff, so I have to make
time to sit down and work on&nbsp;dnsmasq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your motivation for self-hosting, vs. moving to something like
Github or&nbsp;Bitbucket?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The self-hosting setup existed before Github etc, or at least before
they were visible and known to be reliable. It works, so I’ve never had
the activation energy to move it. I’m a sysadmin and I like having a
host to do my stuff, my&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your <span>FAQ</span> says it will run on Linux, *<span>BSD</span>, and embedded systems. What is the
most interesting platform you’ve heard of using&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somebody ran it on <span>QNX</span> once, I&nbsp;believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commit 1 in the dnsmasq git repository happened on January 22, 2004, and
says it is an “import of dnsmasq-2.0.tar.gz.”  When was your first public
release (version 0.4)? How long had you been working on it before&nbsp;then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 2000. There were quite a few releases in the 1.x series, which
were before the <span>DHCP</span> server was added. It didn’t seem worth adding those
when I moved into&nbsp;git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your future plans, dreams, and hopes for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like all code that’s 15 years old, there are deep design decisions and
trade-off that are hard to change but which don’t necessarily make sense
any more. I’d like to do a version 3.0 which addresses those, but I’m
not sure I have the commitment left in me to do&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html">recent security fixes contributed by Google</a> did
you know they were working on dnsmasq, or did the fixes come as a&nbsp;suprise?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They didn’t tell me they were working on dnsmasq before they started,
but once they’d found holes, they let me know well before the public
disclosure. There’s a whole raft of stuff which happens in case like
this, and the Google security people were really good at helping to work
through it.  A lot is helping distributions to get patched packages ready in
advance: I spend a lot of effort helping people backport the fixes to
the older&nbsp;versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have any steps been taken to do a full audit, or is that what Google&nbsp;did?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been quite a few audits over the years, before Google did its
stuff. <span>SUSE</span> did one, and the Mozilla foundation sponsored one. The
Google people used fuzzing to find the holes that had been missed by the
audits - it’s very&nbsp;impressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has the  recent security news changed the development process&nbsp;any?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I plan to use Google’s service to do ongoing fuzzing of new&nbsp;releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything significant on the dnsmasq road map? Are there additions that could
be done, or do you cover all of the <span>DNS</span>/<span>DHCP</span> spec&nbsp;now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t cover the whole spec - the <span>USP</span> [ed. note: Unique Selling Point] is to cover the bits that my
users need, without carrying the bloat of everything else. I guess that
new stuff is still likely in the area of IPv6 address/name management.
IPv6 will take over the world one day, won’t&nbsp;it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: We&nbsp;hope.]</p>
<p>Do you have a Patreon, Flattr, or other funding source to which people could&nbsp;contribute?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a PayPal account at simon@thekelleys.org.uk. Contributions
happily&nbsp;accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks again! I hope our paths will cross some&nbsp;day!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope that’s useful. Please feel free to come back with more questions,
or for clarifications on the&nbsp;answers.</p>

    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Lately, I’ve been playing around with inventing a visual writing system for lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a> (λ-calculus) is a sort of proto-functional-programming, originally invented by Alonzo Church while he was trying to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem">the same problem</a> that led Turing to invent Turing machines. It’s another way of reasoning about computation.</p>

<p>Python’s lambda is an idea that was borrowed from λ-calculus. In Python, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions">lambda expression</a> like the following in order to define a function that returns the square of a number:</p>



<p>In λ-calculus, the idea is the same: we create a function by using <code>λ</code> to specify which arguments a function takes in, then we give an expression for the function’s return value. Pure lambda calculus doesn’t include operators of any sort –&nbsp;just functions being applied to other functions –&nbsp;so if we try to write a <code>square</code> function, we have to suppose that <code>multiply</code> is a function of two variables that has already been defined:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square = λx. multiply x x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>square</code> function, once defined, can be applied to arguments and evaluated into something simpler.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square 4 = (λx. multiply x x) 4
         = multiply 4 4
         = 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the cool things about lambda calculus is that we can represent most common programming abstractions using λ-calculus, even though it’s nothing but functions: numbers, arithmetic, booleans, lists, if statements, loops, recursion… the list goes on. Before I introduce the visual writing system I’ve been using, let’s take a detour and discuss how we can represent numbers and arithmetic using lambda calculus.</p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-calculus">Church numerals, in lambda calculus</h2>
<p>Alonzo Church figured out how to represent numbers as lambda functions; these numbers are referred to as Church numerals.</p>

<p>We can represent any nonnegative integer as long as we have two things: (1) a value for <strong>zero</strong>, and (2) a <strong>successor</strong> function, which returns <code>n + 1</code> for any number <code>n</code>. To represent numbers as functions, then, we require that <code>z</code> (zero) and <code>s</code> (successor) be passed in as arguments, and go from there. Each number is actually secretly a function of those two inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>zero = λs. λz. z
one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)
three = λs. λz. s (s (s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual details of how to implement zero and successor should be implemented as are left as someone else’s problem — we can survive without them. All we care about is that our numbers do the right thing, given whatever zero and successor someone may provide.</p>

<p>What about <strong>addition</strong>? Addition is a function that takes in two numbers (let’s call them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), and produces a number representing their sum. To sum them together, we’ll want to produce a number that applies <code>s</code>, the successor function, a total of <code>x + y</code> times. For example, we could first apply it <code>y</code> times to the zero, then apply it <code>x</code> more times to that result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try proving that one plus one equals two. In λ-calculus, this proof looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)

plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))

plus one one = (λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))) one one
             = λs. λz. one s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s ((λs. λz. s z) s z)
             = λs. λz. s (s z)
             = two
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Long, but at least conciser than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Bertrand Russell’s</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="lambda-circuitry">Lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>There are a lot of lambdas, parentheses, and arguments being pushed around in that proof. Mentally matching up parentheses is annoying. Scope is especially annoying: which <code>s</code> am I looking at again in <code>λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)</code>, the inner one or the outer one?</p>

<p>A linear string of lambdas and parentheses is an ineffective way to provide intuition for the computations that are taking place. This problem isn’t unique to lambda calculus, either; consider trying to represent a binary tree using a linear string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Node(2, Node(7, Leaf(2), Node(6, Leaf(5), Leaf(11))), Node(5, None, Node(9, Leaf(4), None)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unambiguous, but not very intuitive. Contrast that representation with the diagram we use when we’re trying to explain that same binary tree at a chalkboard, a more visual notation:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/288px-Binary_tree.svg.png" alt="Binary tree diagram, from Wikipedia"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_tree.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>I remember programming constructs better when I can reason about them visually like this: when I imagine cutting an array in half for binary search, when I imagine pointers in a linked list being shuffled around to insert a new element, and when I imagine traversing up and down the branches of a binary tree.</p>

<p>Why can’t lambda calculus get some visual intuitions, in the same way? Lambda calculus is a dance of variables flowing through and being manipulated by functions, and I want a writing system for lambda calculus that will visually display this dance. It shouldn’t look like strings of parentheses and symbols: it should create visual intuition.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, here is the system I came up with. I aimed for something that would resemble circuitry.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong> flow along wires, where they may be passed in as arguments to functions or applied as functions themselves. Some are inputs, some are outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong> are represented as boxes which are applied to their inputs on one side and produce a single output on the other. The notation must indicate which function is applied; this may either be drawn within the box itself, or wired in to the middle of the box from some other value.</p>

<p><strong>Arguments</strong> are represented as inputs, coming in from the right side of the diagram; these arguments might pass through functions, or they might be functions-to-apply themselves. If an argument has not been passed in yet, it’s an empty arrow beginning a wire; if an argument has been passed in, its value is attached to the wire. Arguments are always passed in from top to bottom, in order.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s a function which takes in two functions, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, then a value <code>x</code>, and returns <code>f (g x)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f-g-x.png" alt="lambda f. lambda g. lambda x. f (g x)"></p>

<p>As another example, here’s the M combinator <code>M = λx. x x</code> (the “mockingbird” in <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1P096Y"><em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em></a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/m-combinator.png" alt="lambda x. x x"></p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-circuitry">Church numerals, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>Here’s the Church numeral <code>four = λs. λz. s (s (s (s z)))</code>, drawn out in lambda circuitry:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-four.png" alt="Four, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Let’s take that proof from earlier that one plus one is two. What does it look like to draw that proof in lambda circuitry, instead?</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-oneplusoneistwo.png" alt="Proof that one plus one is two, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also consider <strong>multiplication</strong>. A multiply function would take in two numbers, m and n, and computes a new number which is their product. In lambda calculus, we’d write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>multiply = λm. λn. λs. λz. m (n s) z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the notation of lambda circuitry, this looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply.png" alt="Multiplication function, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Using this function, we can check that <code>multiply 2 3</code> evaluates to <code>6</code>:</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-de-bruijn-indices">Sidenote: De Bruijn indices</h2>
<p>One of the nice things about lambda circuitry is that it completely removes the need for variable names.</p>

<p>There’s another notation for lambda calculus that does this too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index"><em>De Bruijn indices</em></a>. A lambda expression written with De Bruijn indices indicates which variables are used where with a positive integer; the smaller the integer, the more recently the argument it refers to was passed in.</p>

<p>For example, the identity function <code>λx. x</code> may be written with De Bruijn indices like so:</p>



<p>The Church numeral for two, <code>λs. λz. s (s z)</code>, may be written like so:</p>



<p>The addition function, <code>λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))</code>, may be written like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An evaluation of <code>plus one one</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus one one = (λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1) (λ λ 2 1)
             = (λ (λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 ((λ λ 2 1) 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (2 1)
             = λ λ 2 (2 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the tricky things about writing a lambda calculus interpreter is getting the renaming rules right; De Bruijn indices are convenient because they remove the need for this. Lambda circuitry is similar in spirit to De Bruijn indices in that it doesn’t require variable names at all, but instead indicates which variables are passed where by connecting values directly to an arrow indicating when they were passed in.</p>

<h2 id="argument-switching-function-in-lambda-circuitry">Argument-switching function, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>I’ll provide more examples just to further demonstrate how the notation works in different situations. Let’s consider the “argument-switching” function <code>C</code>, where <code>C f x y</code> returns <code>f y x</code>. (This is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system">C combinator</a>.)</p>



<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator.png" alt="C combinator"></p>

<p>Suppose we try applying this to a silly function <code>f</code> where <code>f x y</code> discards <code>y</code> and just returns <code>x</code>. Then, <code>C f</code> should switch around <code>f</code>‘s arguments and create a function which returns <code>y</code> instead. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>f = λx. λy. x

C f = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) f
    = λx. λy. f y x
    = λx. λy. (λx. λy. x) y x
    = λx. λy. y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f.png" alt="f = lambda x. lambda y. x"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-1.png" alt="C(f), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-2.png" alt="C(f), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-3.png" alt="C(f), step 3"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also try a function <code>g</code> where <code>g x y</code> returns <code>x y</code>. Then <code>C g x y</code> should return <code>y x</code>. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g = λx. λy. x y

C g x y = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) g x y
        = g y x
        = (λx. λy. x y) y x
        = y x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-g.png" alt="g = lambda x. lambda y. x(y)"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-1.png" alt="C(g), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-2.png" alt="C(g), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-3.png" alt="C(g), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-4.png" alt="C(g), step 4"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p><em>Exercise</em>: Show that applying <code>C</code> twice reverses it. That is, show that <code>C (C f)</code> returns <code>f</code>, for any <code>f</code>.
(Note that <code>C f</code> is a function which takes in two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>f y x</code>. Applying <code>C</code> only to <code>f</code> like this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2>
<p>There are some other systems that give visual intuition to lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/"><em>To Dissect a Mockingbird</em></a> describes a notation that is actually very similar to the one I’ve described, and demonstrates it on various problems from <em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>. I like the way this looks, especially how every function is enclosed by two halves of a circle which make it obvious how that function might be applied. My notation doesn’t have this feature, but requires drawing fewer enclosing boxes as a result.</p>

<p>Visual Lambda (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/visual-lambda/">code</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/visual_lambda_bubble_notation.gif">basics</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">paper</a>) represents lambda expressions as colored bubbles, and provides an interface for manipulating them.</p>

<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/">Alligator Eggs</a> is a description of a puzzle game based on lambda calculus, which also happens to provide a visual way of working with and evaluating lambda expressions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
  Everybody loves remote work until it’s time to get promoted.
  </p>
  <p>
  In 2015, Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom conducted a <a href="https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf">work from home experiment</a> in China with Ctrip, a 16,000-employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency.
  </p>
  <p>
  The study found that remote workers had a 13 percent performance increase over onsite employees as well as better work satisfaction and lower turnover. 
  </p>
  <p>
  But the study also found that remote workers were still about <em>50 percent less likely</em> to get a performance-based promotion than the onsite employees. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Focus group interviews reveal how supervisors did not notice home-based employees’ performance as much and were less likely to promote them. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Another reason behind reduced promotion rates might be that WFH employees lack opportunities to develop the interpersonal skills to succeed in managerial jobs. 
  </p>
  <p>
  If you’re not taking the opportunity to communicate <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork">your progress</a>, then people may equate your lack of presence with a lack of skill. 
  </p>
  <p>
  A substantial amount of the remote workers in the study returned to the office once given the choice. This was done to avoid what they perceived as a WFH promotion ‘discrimination’ penalty. 
  </p>
  <h2>Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind</h2>
  
  
  <p>
  The above highlights the important difference between <em>remote first </em>companies and <em>remote friendly </em>companies. 
  </p>
  <p>
  At remote first companies like Gitlab and Buffer, everyone works remotely. These companies have specific communication protocols in place and the appropriate documentation needed to succeed in such an environment. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The promotion worries, though, tend to arise when you work at a remote friendly company. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Remote friendly companies treat remote as a <em>perk</em>. It’s not the status quo and is still treated as a privilege. 
  </p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_promotionremote/friendly_first.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  Sure, moving home to Florida to be closer to your aging parents sounds wonderful, but what happens when your coworkers don’t decide to relocate and continue going into the office?
  </p>
  <p>
  Turns out there’s some more research that looks at exactly this. 
  </p>
  <h2>Passive Face Time</h2>
  
  
  <p>
  A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726709353139">study</a> by researchers at UC Davis from 10 years ago coins the term <em>passive face time</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The term doesn’t refer to active interactions with coworkers, but rather to just being seen in the workplace.
  </p>
  <p>
  As long as you’re observed at work, you accumulate passive face time. No one actually needs to know what you’re working on or how well of a job you’re doing. It’s entirely independent of actual performance.
  </p>
  <p>
  The study notes that even when onsite and remote employees are equally productive, supervisors might evaluate them differently because of differences in their passive face time.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of the more interesting findings of the study is that managers seem to interpret passive face time as an indicator of specific traits. So individuals that are credited with more passive face time may be viewed as more responsible, dependable, and committed. Traits that you’d directly correlate with promotion. 
  </p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_promotionremote/graph.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  The context of passive face time (i.e during regular hours versus outside-of-normal work hours) also appears important to the particular traits that managers assigned to those displaying passive face time. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, coming in early to work and leaving 30min before most people leave may help you beat traffic, but from your manager’s perspective that passive face time may be discounted. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, these trait inferences appear to be made subconsciously, without intent or knowledge of the process by the managers. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In an ideal world, yes, you’d be judged purely on performance. But the real world is messy and subject to biases like the above. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The ongoing transition to remote work is still in the honeymoon stage. It’s easy to only look at the tremendous freedom it offers. And also most likely a mistake.  
  </p>
  <h2>Credit</h2>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

<p><strong>AWS KMS</strong> is a <strong>K</strong>ey <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>S</strong>ervice that let you create Cryptographic keys that you can use to encrypt and decrypt data and also other keys. You can read more about it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="important-points-about-keys">Important points about Keys</h3>
<p>Please note that the CMK generated can only be used to encrypt small amount of data like passwords, RSA key. You can use AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) to generate, encrypt, and decrypt data keys. However, AWS KMS does not store, manage, or track your data keys, or perform cryptographic operations with data keys. You must use and manage data keys outside of AWS KMS. KMS API uses AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) in the encryption operations and they cannot accept more than 4 KB (4096 bytes) of data. To encrypt application data, use the server-side encryption features of an AWS service, or a client-side encryption library, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or the Amazon S3 encryption client.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>We want to create signup and login forms for a website.Passwords should be encrypted and stored in dynamobDB database. </p>
<h3 id="what-do-we-need-">What do we need?</h3>
<ol>
<li>KMS key to encrypt and decrypt data</li>
<li>DynamoDB table to store password.</li>
<li>Lamdba functions &amp; APIs to process Login and Sign up forms.

</ol>
<h3 id="lets-implement-it-as-serverless-appication-model-sam-">Lets Implement it as Serverless Appication Model (SAM)!</h3>
<p>Lets first create the Key that we will use to encrypt and decrypt password.</p>
<pre><code>KmsKey:
    Type: AWS::KMS::Key
    Properties: 
      Description: CMK for encrypting and decrypting
      KeyPolicy:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Id: key-default-1
        Statement:

<p>The important thing in above snippet is the KeyPolicy. KMS requires a Key Administrator and Key User. As a best practice your Key Administrator and Key User should be 2 separate user in your Organisation. We are allowing all permissions to the root users.  So if your key Administrator leaves the organisation, the root user will be able to delete this key. As you can see KeyAdmin can manage the key but not use it and KeyUser can only use the key. <em>${KeyAdmin}</em> and <em>${KeyUser}</em> are parameters in the SAM template. You would be asked to provide values for these parameters during SAM Deploy. </p>
<pre><code>Parameters:
  KeyAdmin:
    Type: String
  KeyUser:
    Type: String
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/kms/parameters.jpg" alt="SAM parameters">
Next, we will create DynamoDB table. The partition key will be user id. This is enough. You can additional attributes as required.</p>
<pre><code>myDynamoDBTable: 
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties: 
      BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST 
      AttributeDefinitions: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "userid"
          AttributeType: "S"

      KeySchema: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "userid"
          KeyType: "HASH"
</code></pre>
<p>Now, lets create the API and Lamdba handler that will process the Signup and Login requests.</p>
<pre><code>ApiGatewaySignupApi:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Api
    Properties:
      StageName: Prod
    Auth:
     UsagePlan:
      CreateUsagePlan: PER_API
      Description: Usage plan for this API

          keyid: !Ref KmsKey
      CodeUri: Lambda/
      Handler: signup.lambda_handler
      Runtime: python3.8
      Policies:

      Events:
        getCounter:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /login
            Method: POST
            RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayLoginApi
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we are creating 2 Lamdba handlers, one that handles singup and other handles the login. We are limiting the usage of API under <em>Auth</em> property. This is to prevent abuse of our API. We are setting two environment variables, one for database table name and another for KMS key name. We are not hard-coding the table/key names instead we let cloud formation to name it and we set it as environment variables with auto generated values. This will prevent name conflicts of resources and you can run multiple versions of your whole cloud environment. Then we set policy that allow Lamdba to access dynamoDB and the key.  You can find 'out of box' SAM policy templates <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-templates.html">here</a>.With <em>Events</em>, we create the API Gateway resources.
The final part of SAM template is Output section.</p>
<pre><code>Outputs:
  ApiGatewaySignupApi:
    Description: "API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage for Hello World function"
    Value: !Sub "https://${ApiGatewaySignupApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/signup/"
  SignupFunction:
    Description: "Sign Up Lambda Function ARN"
    Value: !GetAtt SignupFunction.Arn
  ApiGatewayLoginApi:
    Description: "API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage for Hello World function"
    Value: !Sub "https://${ApiGatewayLoginApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/login/"
  LoginFunction:
    Description: "Login Lambda Function ARN"
    Value: !GetAtt LoginFunction.Arn
</code></pre>
<p>We output 2 important urls in above section, <em>ApiGatewayLoginApi</em> and <em>ApiGatewaySignupApi</em>,  We use these Urls in the frontend HTML form's <em>action</em> attribute. See below:</p>

<p>The first two statements are logging statements, this is useful in debugging and the log statements will be logged in CloudWatch logs. The <em>parse_qs</em> module is used to read the form data from <em>event</em> object. Data are returned as a dictionary. The dictionary keys are the unique query variable names and the values are lists of values for each name. …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Despite the “death of the mainframe” being a headline for many years, IBM is still making new generations of mainframes. Large customers running mission-critical workloads still want this level of technology, and pay top dollar for it. The latest IBM Z15 mainframe shows just how awesome the design of these systems gets. We get to cover this at Hot Chips 32 (2020.) We are going to update this piece as new details emerge over the talk. <span id="more-46268"></span></p>
<h2>IBM Z15 Mainframe Overview</h2>
<p>A mainframe is designed differently than we see typical commodity x86 servers in many aspects. One of them is simply the way the processor complexes are constructed and delivered. A great example of this is how there is a system control chip shared between processors with a massive L4 cache. Abstracting this a bit, it is somewhat analogous to how AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” is constructed with a chip that has a shared last-level cache. Then again, IBM z15 is bigger.</p>

<p>One of the cooler features here is that the processor chip runs at 5.2GHz on 14nm process. These are not like mainstream processors so IBM has a lot more leeway in terms of higher TDP levels and cooling methodology. The IBM z15 is the company’s second 14nm part like the z14. As one can see, IBM is following Intel in sticking on 14nm longer than other nodes.</p>

<p>We are going to note, that we covered <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-power10-searching-for-the-holy-grail-of-compute/">IBM POWER10</a> earlier today.</p>
<h2>IBM z15 Drawer Level Design Overview</h2>
<p>Within the IBM Z15, processors are not designed to operate alone. Instead, there are up to four processor chips per drawer. Each drawer also has a system control chip with the L4 last level cache and to handle an interconnect. One can get up to five drawers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46271"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-drawer-and-system-topology/" rel="attachment wp-att-46271"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Drawer And System Topology" width="940" height="591" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology.jpg 940w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-400x251.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-800x503.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-696x438.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-668x420.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46271">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Drawer And System Topology</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a view of what the chipset and drawer look like:</p>

<p>On the top we have I/O above that system controller chip. Overall, this allows for up to 240 cores, 40TB of memory, and 60x PCIe x16 cards in the complete system.</p>
<h2>IBM z15 Processor Design Overview</h2>
<p>Each IBM z15 processor chip can have up to 12 cores. These cores have 4MB L2 cache and 256MB of shared L3 cache. IBM increasing a lot of the microarchitectural features versus the previous 14nm z14 design.</p>

<p>As one may imagine, IBM has a deep pipeline that is designed to operate at very high frequencies. Compared to Intel that is using much lower frequencies on its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-ice-lake-sp-next-gen-xeon-architecture-at-hc32/">Intel Ice Lake-SP Next-Gen Xeon Architecture</a>, IBM is using fewer cores that run at higher frequencies yet that still do a lot of work per core.</p>

<p>Another feature of the design is the new accelerators. One is the integrated deflate accelerator:</p>
<figure id="attachment_46275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46275"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-integrated-deflate-accelerator/" rel="attachment wp-att-46275"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Integrated Deflate Accelerator" width="1487" height="902" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator.jpg 1487w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-400x243.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-800x485.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-696x422.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-1068x648.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-692x420.jpg 692w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46275">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Integrated Deflate Accelerator</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a hybrid LZ encoder and compressor. Compressing data helps the systems various memory and storage hierarchies be used more efficiently. With hardware-acceleration, these features can be added with less overhead. That hardware accelerator was previously a FPGA. That means the clock speed has gone from a few hundred megahertz to 5GHz+.</p>

<p>Since many of these systems are used at banks and other financial institutions, cryptography is another key feature of the z15.</p>

<p>IBM z15 has modulo arithmetic (ECC) acceleration built-in. This increases performance which means that this encryption can be used with minimal overhead.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46277"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-processor-modulo-arithmetic-ecc-acceleration-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-46277"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Processor Modulo Arithmetic ECC Acceleration 2" width="1498" height="956" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2.jpg 1498w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-400x255.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-800x511.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-696x444.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-1068x682.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-658x420.jpg 658w" sizes="(max-width: 1498px) 100vw, 1498px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46277">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Processor Modulo Arithmetic ECC Acceleration 2</figcaption></figure>
<p>Something we wanted to highlight on this slide is that the 11.4x-21.8x speedup is for the on-chip z15 accelerator versus the “z14 using a Crypto Express6 PCI accelerator.” That frees up expansion slots for other uses while also increasing performance.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>We are unlikely to review a z15 at STH. Still, seeing this awesome hardware is always interesting. Hopefully, our readers will enjoy the quick look at the IBM z15.</p>

Although lay audiences like to <em>guess</em> at methods (more on that later), magicians <em>analyse</em> tricks to reverse engineer them, and this is part of the fun magicians experience.</li></ol><p>A magician to magician trick therefore succeeds best when it is a “magician fooler”.  It does so in two ways.</p><p>First, the audience magicians enjoy exhausting their magical knowledge.  They feel smart, but challenged applying their expertise to reverse engineer another’s efforts at creating something new and cutting edge.  The fact they failed, can be invigorating, affirming that there is more to learn!</p><p>Second, because the audience magicians understand method they are no longer able to experience <em>effect</em>; doing something that allows them to be fooled again creates a very rare experience, and huge value.  It satiates a need.</p><p>Tech is no different.  Engineer to engineer presentations / applications of technology are designed to wow on the basis of their technical complexity and ingenuity’ to create a FOMO that one engineer has mastered or discovered something another has not, and sometimes push debate and enquiry.</p><h4>Magician to muggle tricks</h4><p>For lay audience tricks, everything is effect. But wait, don’t audiences love guessing the methods of a magician’s tricks?</p><p>Of course they do, but don’t confuse audience enjoyment <em>guessing</em> secrets vs. having them revealed.</p><blockquote><p>Audiences <em>want</em> the secret, but <em>need</em> the effect.  <br></p><p>If you give them the secret, there is <em>no</em> effect.</p></blockquote><figure><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="603" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-secret.jpg" alt="The Prestige - They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for the secret - Alfred Borden

The greatest magicians seek out, voraciously study and obsessively practice methods.  They also test, test, test them on audiences, improving them or changing them over time.</p><p>But they do so, guided by effect.</p><p>They are seeking the best method, or combination of methods, that produce the best effect.  In many cases, this will be the method or methods that allow most room for <em>presentation</em> and <em>execution</em>.</p><p>These two factors – presentation and execution – are what separate dull from good and good from incredible, even if the underlying trick, plot or method is identical between two magicians.</p><p>In other words, attention on the audience’s needs and experience.

But not easy</h4><p>In the 2006 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a>, chronicling two rival magicians there is a central magic trick.  Not only is this a real trick, but it also doubles up as the central plot twist.</p><p>Without spoiling the film, this conceit is – as the magician Borden puts it – incredibly simple, but not easy.</p><p>Indeed, a central plot point is the failure of the rival magician to comprehend that the first magician’s effect (i.e. product) could be achieved so simply, instead obsessing over unnecesary, dangerous and overly complex technological innovations to achieve the same effect.</p><p>And this is a key lesson.</p><p>Too often, magicians and technologists obsess over the complex, and disregard simpler alternatives.  The allure of the complex is also a risk for users and innovators in their organisations.  If you’ve ever heard someone say “we should get an AI” or “can we use some AI” when what they need is a simple Word macro you know what we mean.</p><p>But this isn’t to say simple is easy.</p><p>Often simple done well is just as hard as clever, but for different reasons.</p><p>Simple enables thinking space to focus on execution against needs.</p><p>In magic this is mostly presentation. In technology this is the product-market fit, UX, whether or not your solution solves a real and significant problem for your users and so on.</p><h4>Check your geek</h4><p>As a result, the best technologists and start-ups keep abreast of new ideas, experiment with them but importantly <strong>check their geek</strong>.  They weigh up, often with others (product specialists, users and so on), what <em>best</em> solves the user’s problem.</p><p>In most cases, best isn’t cleverest or the most cutting edge shiny new thing.  It might be, but it often isn’t or if it is, it is one variable in a much larger equation that must not distract from solving the problem.</p><p>Which leads nicely into…</p><h4>Don’t forget what you have / know</h4><p>Magicians are famously greedy, gobbling up new tricks as they launch.  The best magicians keep this in check, often preferring to perfect existing techniques rather than chase the latest shiny object.</p><p>Technology is no different.</p><p>During the Space Race, Nasa invested millions designing an over engineered pen that could write in zero gravity where, it was assumed, ink would not flow toward the nib.  Russia simply gave its Cosmonauts standard pencils, which work on earth as they do in zero G.  Same result: hugely different costs.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="863" height="1024" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg 863w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-253x300.jpg 253w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-768x911.jpg 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-585x694.jpg 585w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>© <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/saga-writing-space">Smithsonian National Air &amp; Space Museum</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s a great story, but it’s <strong>not</strong> true (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_in_space">here</a> for the real story, or the link under the above photo).</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s an instructive parable.</p><p>Don’t rush to the most cutting edge solution if all the user needs is something simple, and in the above example, something you might already have but not think to use.</p><h4>Shiny objects are often sharp</h4><p>Not all magic tricks are harmless card tricks.  For instance, the infamous Russian Roulette trick.</p><p>The plot goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>The magician presents a sharp nail on a wooden base, which is placed point up under a polystyrene cup.</p><p>Next, the magician introduces additional upside down polystyrene cups and then asks a spectator to shuffle the cups until it is no longer possible for anyone to identify which cup conceals the nail.</p><p>Afterwards, the magician then has the spectator eliminate cups one by one, often reshuffling the cups after each selection to increase the “randomness” and make it even harder to identify the dangerous cup from the safe one(s).</p><p>Eventually, two cups remain. The magician asks the spectator to choose one of the remaining cups.</p><p>This time the magician does not remove the chosen cup.</p><p>Instead, the magician slams either their palm, or the spectator’s, onto the final remaining cup.</p></blockquote><p>There is either a shared outtake of breath from the audience followed by a cheer… or gasps of horror.</p><p>The former is when this trick goes well… the magician magically avoids the nail, knowing all along via “psychic” skills where the dangerous nail hid.</p><p>The latter is what happens when the trick goes wrong, i.e. nail through hand = hospital visit.  No more show bookings.  Potential lawsuits.  And so on!</p><p>This trick has, and continues, to go wrong from time to time, injuring magicians and spectators, including on live TV.   See below if you aren’t squeamish.  The UK”s most famous magician, Derren Brown, has even gotten this badly wrong during rehearsals (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqzfsfpMv0">here</a>).</p><figure><div><div data-mode="normal" data-provider="youtube" id="arve-RIqzfsfpMv0" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><p><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIqzfsfpMv0?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" name="" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" scrolling="no" width="480" height="270" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIqzfsfpMv0?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p></div></div></figure><p>So what’s this got to do with technology?</p><p>Well this is a reminder of why mastery of method is critical, even if the focus is on its relationship to effect.</p><p>If the method isn’t clear, safe, and bug-free, for end-users to rely upon in different settings it can harm.</p><p>The same is true of technology.</p><p>It is often more true for new and “high tech” solutions that aren’t yet well understood by end-users… and sometimes by the technologists themselves, who’ve simply copied and pasted some code, or installed a code library.</p><p>AI is a good example.</p><p>Today’s AI relies heavily on data, statistics, probability, linear algebra and calculus.  Most of these components are poorly understood by users in isolation, let alone in combination when used to deliver AI solutions.  Some software engineers building such systems don’t really understand the underlying math, and in some scenarios this doesn’t matter in order to build good products, but in others it absolutely does.</p><p>For instance, simple misunderstandings regarding the <a href="https://lawtomated.com/accuracy-precision-recall-and-f1-scores-for-lawyers/">accuracy …</a></p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html">jsonb</a> is, undeniably, <em>king</em>. It is a very flexible data
type, that allows for unstructured/schema-less storage. It has very powerful
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING">indexing mechanisms</a>, and its internal
representation is reasonably compact and efficient. It comes with advanced operators and expressions to query/extract
parts of it, and has
<a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/talks/jsonb-roadmap-pgcon-2020.pdf">recently seen the addition of SQL/JSON path</a>
functionality to extend that to comply with the SQL Standard.</p>
<p>There are countless posts and resources explaining the virtues of this data type and what you can accomplish with it. So
nothing else to add, except to reiterate my appreciation for all those who have worked on creating and contributing to
it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch. <code>jsonb</code> supports… just JSON! That’s great, but is it enough?</p>
<h2 id="json-data-types">JSON data types</h2>
<p>JSON is a container data type, which means it can store other data types contained within. And which data types it does
support? From the <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON Spec</a>, it supports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number, which is a quite flexible “numeric” data type.</li>
<li>String.</li>
<li>Boolean.</li>
<li>Null.</li>
<li>Array, or probably better called a “bag” or “container”, a sequence of elements of, possibly, mixed types.</li>
<li>Object, a collection of key-value pairs, where the value may be any other JSON data type.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>jsonb</code> maps these JSON data types, internally, to Postgres types. It is easy to see the resolved (JSON) data types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>select</span> <span>key</span>, value, jsonb_typeof(value) <span>from</span> jsonb_each(
<span>'{"a": 42, "b": true, "c": "hi", "d": null, "e": [42, "hi"], "f": {"a": 1}}'</span>
);
<span>┌─────┬────────────┬──────────────┐</span>
<span>│</span> <span>key</span> <span>│</span>   value    <span>│</span> jsonb_typeof <span>│</span>
<span>├─────┼────────────┼──────────────┤</span>
<span>│</span> a   <span>│</span> <span>42</span>         <span>│</span> <span>number</span>       <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> b   <span>│</span> <span>true</span>       <span>│</span> <span>boolean</span>      <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> <span>c</span>   <span>│</span> <span>"hi"</span>       <span>│</span> string       <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> d   <span>│</span> <span>null</span>       <span>│</span> <span>null</span>         <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> e   <span>│</span> [<span>42</span>, <span>"hi"</span>] <span>│</span> <span>array</span>        <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> f   <span>│</span> <span>{</span><span>"a"</span>: <span>1</span><span>}</span>   <span>│</span> <span>object</span>       <span>│</span>
<span>└─────┴────────────┴──────────────┘</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Scalar types are mapped to boolean, text and numeric. Essentially, three different data types. Now check
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html">all the data types available in Postgres</a>. There are dozens. And
obviously you can extend with your own. Isn’t it a bit limiting that, in essence, you need to conflate any existing data
type to either a <code>numeric</code> or a <code>text</code>? What if you want to represent a timestamp? Convert it to text (well, Postgres
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/3ed2005ff595d349276e5b2edeca1a8100b08c87/src/backend/utils/adt/jsonb.c#L45">does it for
you</a>,
but you get the point). What about a <code>inet</code>, or a <code>point</code>? What about my <code>custom-amazing-data-type</code>?</p>
<p>According to the JSON spec, this is correct and there’s nothing else to do. So the question is not about whether <code>jsonb</code>
has any implementation flaws, but if Postgres users are enough with “just JSON”.</p>
<p>I find it particularly frustrating having to store binary data (<code>bytea</code>) in a JSON. Since there’s no <code>bytea</code> data type in
JSON (nor <code>jsonb</code>, consequently) you need to convert it to a text representation. There are several solutions, none of
them a good enough one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Convert it to a string, byte by byte. Probably a very bad option, as it suffers two main problems: one is that
Postgres strings, not being strictly UTF-8 comformant (and this is a topic for another blog post…), cannot store the
UTF-8 null (<code>\0</code>) character. As such, if one of those bytes had the 0 value (likely), it could not be stored. Second,
a sequence of bytes interpreted as a string does not have the same ordering as the original byte sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <code>base64</code>. Other than the extra space, ordering is not preserved (i.e., an index on the original byte
sequence would yield a different order than an index on the base64-encoded text). The solution is to use expression
indexes on the decoded value, if order needs to be preserved. This adds overhead anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#base32hex">base32hex</a>, an even more verbose encoding but that
preserves order. There are no functions in Postgres for this encoding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-beyond-json">Looking beyond JSON</h2>
<p>So how would you store other specific, more compact, or benefit from existing functions from additional datatypes, with
current JSON and <code>jsonb</code>? The only option to avoid data type information erasure is to encode the data type as part of
the JSON string. Something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
	<span>"key1"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"inet"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"10.0.0.0/8"</span>},
	<span>"array"</span>: [<span>3</span>, {<span>"key2"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"point"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"(42, -42)"</span>}<span>]</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>It is easy to see the several drawbacks of this approach: much more verbose and storage needs; need to continuously
cast; and need to do conditional casts depending on the data type.</p>
<p>I’m not alone in the pursue of a more generic, supporting more data type JSON-like language, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/">MongoDB’s BSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(serialization_format)">Amazon’s ION</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBJSON">Universal Binary JSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.LowLevelAPI.html">DynamoDB’s Item HTTP
API</a>.
This is a very interesting case, as it is a JSON-compliant input/output interface, with type definition following an
approach similar to the one outlined above (where the value is an object which includes both the type and the value
itself), but which is claimed to be stored internally in an optimized form (not as-is). It has interesting composite
types like “homogeneus arrays”, where are elements must be of the same time or sets, which forbid duplicated values.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.ongres.com/img/blog/post_jsonb.jpg" alt="Beyond jsonb: a generalized jsonb supertype for Postgres?"></p>
<p>So how would such a generalized unstructured data type work in Postgres? I’d say it could leverage all the existing
jsonb infrastructure. After all, jsonb already knows each element’s data type, so this just needs to be extended to
many, potentially arbitrary data types (to support custom data types too). As such, new data types should be easy to
add. Other features (like ensuring homogeneus-ness across array elements for supporting sets; or ensuring uniqueness
within an element) may require some differentiation. Being a superset, I’d expect the same codebase could accommodate
well both data types (a similar retrofit was performed in the past from <code>hstore</code> to use <code>jsonb</code>'s codebase).</p>
<p>One of the main requisites is that this generalized unstructured data type would be a super set of the actual JSON, so
that any JSON string (and consequently <code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code> values) can be converted to it implicitly. I envision the
hardest parts, or at least the ones that may trigger more discussion, to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze existing JSON-superset data types and deciding on the set of features to implement.</li>
<li>Selecting the data types to support, if not <em>all</em>.</li>
<li>Input syntax? Some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Use different value enclosing depending on the data type. E.g. <code>key: {{ dmFsdWU= }}</code> (Amazon Ion).</li>
<li>Wrap the value in constructor-like syntax, like MongoDB shell: <code>key: NumberLong(42)</code>.</li>
<li>Turn values into a nested JSON object with type (document’s key) and value, similar to DynamoDB’s HTTP API:
<code>"key": { "N": "42" }</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the hardest one: pick the name of the new datatype!</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you think? <strong>Should Postgres get a JSON-superset data type, a generalized unstructured data type</strong>?  Leave

<p><em>Personal note</em>: I find it hard to understand why Oleg Bartunov, one of the most significant contributors to JSON in
Postgres, among many other features,

Not only I believe major contributions cannot be taken back; but in this particular case it feels even harder to understand. Let

              <p>Navigating in the ocean of Haskell possibilities is challenging even though Haskell is a powerful language that helps to implement robust and maintainable programs. The language supplies you with tons of awesome approaches, but it is not always trivial to see how and where to use them properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like any other mainstream programming language, Haskell also has its best-practices and recommended ways for producing high-quality code. Knowing Haskell programming patterns helps you create better libraries and applications and make their users more pleased. And, yes, Haskell actually has FP-oriented programming patterns in addition to the best-practices shared with other languages.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the best ways to solve common problems, you can become a better Haskell developer by using more efficient programming techniques specific to the language. Likewise, you can apply Haskell-specific patterns successfully outside of Haskell.</p>
<p>This blog post contains a structured collection of some programming mini-patterns in Haskell with the detailed description and examples, some small “quality of life” improvements that would help everyone on their developer journey.</p>
<p>📚 In this article, each pattern contains at least one task with the hidden solution, so you can test your understanding of a pattern by solving the proposed task.</p>

<p>Newtype</p>

<p>Lightweight data wrapper.</p>

</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Additional wrapping and unwrapping.</li>
<li>Deriving boilerplate is required to duplicate existing behaviour of the underlying type.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most common and useful Haskell features is <code>newtype</code>. <code>newtype</code> is an ordinary data type with the name and a constructor. However, you can define a data type as <code>newtype</code> instead of <code>data</code> only if it has <strong>exactly</strong> one constructor with <strong>exactly</strong> one field.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to define a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell as no extra effort is required from the user compared to the data type declaration. For example, the following are the valid <code>newtype</code> definitions:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- + Valid definition of a wrapper around Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>-- + Also valid newtype definition with the record field</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=</span> <span>Size</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    {<span> unSize ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But you can’t declare the following data types as a <code>newtype</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- - Invalid newtype definition: more than 1 field</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    {<span> pointX ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    ,<span> pointY ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    }</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- - Ivalid newtype definition: more than 1 constructor</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>newtype</span> <span>Shape</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">    <span>=</span> <span>Circle</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">    <span>|</span> <span>Square</span> <span>Double</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>newtype</code>s have a lot of great benefits but I’m going to focus only on the <em>code maintainability</em> in this section.</p>
<p>You can think of a <code>newtype</code> as a lightweight data type. Newtype has the same representation in memory as the wrapped type. Wrapping and unwrapping are also free operations in runtime. So, <code>newtype</code> is a <strong>zero-cost</strong> abstraction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding from the compiler point of view, different <code>newtype</code>s are different data types. And since they don’t have any runtime overhead compared to the ordinary data types, you can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Shall we look at the example now. Consider, that you have a function which takes a password, a hash and verifies whether the given hash is the hash of the given password. Since both password and hash are merely textual data, we could write the following function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this function is that you can easily pass arguments in a different order and get faulty results. And you need to think about proper order of arguments each time you are calling this function. Should it be <code>validateHash password hash</code> or <code>validateHash hash password</code>? This approach is error-prone.</p>
<p>But if you define the following <code>newtype</code>s instead:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    {<span> unPassword ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    }</span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>PasswordHash</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">    {<span> unPasswordHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can implement a more type-safe version of the <code>validateHash</code> function, and additionally this improves the code readability:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>Password</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, <code>validateHash hash password</code> is a compile-time error, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias (which is simply another name for a data type) by using the <code>type</code> keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution since it helps only a developer, not the compiler as the compiler doesn’t see the difference between type alias and type itself. And if you don’t help your compiler, the compiler won’t be there for you when you need it.</p>
<p>For example, the following code is flawed:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Attack</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>type</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>calculateDamage ::</span> <span>Attack</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Attack</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the above type signature is better than <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, but the compiler sees it exactly like this. So, you still can write <code>calculateDamage monsterDefense playerAttack</code> and get a runtime bug.</p>
<p>The approach of using <code>type</code>s instead of <code>newtype</code> can bring even more damage when you have a lot of similar data types. The more types you have the harder to maintain them without external help. Below you can see a code sample from one of the Haskell libraries:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The library safety can be improved by replacing all these type aliases with <code>newtype</code>s, and it can even help to discover some bugs that happen due to passing arguments in the wrong order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <code>newtype</code> approach is more flexible since you can provide your custom instances or restrict some instances allowing you to create values in an unsafe way.</p>
<p>The cost of using <code>newtype</code> is small — you only need to wrap and unwrap it when necessary. But the benefits hugely outweigh this small price.</p>

<p>Smart constructor</p>

<p>Providing idiomatic ways for constructing values.</p>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a data type restricts some values (e.g.&nbsp;not every <code>ByteString</code> is a valid <code>Password</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to make construction of big data types easier.</li>
<li>To avoid runtime errors.</li>
<li>To make illegal states unrepresentable.</li>

<li>Some extra code.</li>
<li>Decide on the approach details.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have a <code>newtype</code>, first you need to create its value to work with it. And sometimes you want to validate a value before proceeding with it. Usually you would create a value of a data type by using its constructor. However, when programming in a modular way, you want to have boundaries in your interface and avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.</p>
<p>This programming pattern in Haskell is called <strong>smart constructor</strong>. It can be understood better by looking at the implementation of such approach based on the <code>Password</code> data type:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>module</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">    ( <span>Password</span> (unPassword)</span>

<p>When a user posts a new comment or reviews a PR, the action is triggered. If there is a high probability that the content would be classified as toxic, the bot creates a comment tagging the author and advising to update the content.</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo:</p>
<p><img src="https://charliegerard.dev/demo.gif"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/charliegerard/safe-space">repo</a></p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the code, it is probably important to note that this is a <strong>JavaScript action</strong>. I read that actions could also be in Docker containers but for simplicity, I stuck with JS.</p>
<p>First, I created a action.yml file at the root of my project folder.</p>
<p>Inside this file, I wrote the following code:</p>
<pre><code>name: "Safe space"
description: "Detect the potential toxicity of PR comments"
inputs:
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    required: true
  message:
    required: false
  toxicity_threshold:
    required: false
runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: "dist/index.js"
</code></pre>
<p>The first couple of lines are self-explanatory. Then, the <code>inputs</code> property contains 3 different elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> is a secret token required to authenticate in your workflow run and is automatically generated.</li>
<li>The <code>message</code> property is optional and can be used by people if they want to customise the content of the comment posted by the bot if the action detects toxic comments.</li>
<li>The <code>toxicity_threshold</code> property is also optional and allows people to set a custom threshold that will be used by the machine learning model when making predictions about a comment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the settings under <code>runs</code> indicate the version of Node.js we want our action to run with, as well as the file the action code lives in.</p>
<h2>Action code</h2>
<p>To create a JavaScript action, you need to install and require at least 2 Node.js modules: <code>@actions/core</code> and <code>@actions/github</code>. As this particular action uses a TensorFlow.js model, I also installed and required <code>@tensorflow-models/toxicity</code> and <code>@tensorflow/tfjs</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in my <code>dist/index.js</code> file, I started writing my action code.</p>
<p>The core setup could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>async function run() {
  const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs");
  const toxicity = require("@tensorflow-models/toxicity");
  await tf.setBackend("cpu");

  try {
    const githubToken = core.getInput("GITHUB_TOKEN");
    const customMessage = core.getInput("message");
    const toxicityThreshold = core.getInput("toxicity_threshold");
    const { context } = github;
  } catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p>There is a main <code>run</code> function that requires the packages needed and sets the backend for TensorFlow.js. Then in a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> statement, the code gets the 3 parameters mentioned a bit earlier that we'll be using soon.
Finally, we get the context of the event when the action is triggered.</p>
<h3>Creating a bot comment when a user posts a comment on an issue or PR</h3>
<p>A few different events can trigger a Github action. As this action is interested in getting the comments posted on an issue or PR, we need to start by looking at the payload of the event and see if the property <code>comment</code> is defined. Then we can also look at the type of action (here <code>created</code> and <code>edited</code>), to run the predictions only when a new comment is added or one is edited, but not deleted for example.</p>
<p>More details are available on the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">official Github documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I then access a few parameters needed to request the comments for the right issue or PR, load the machine learning model, and if the property <code>match</code> is true on one of the results coming back from the predictions, it means the comment has been classified as toxic and I generate a new comment with the warning message.</p>
<pre><code>if (context.payload.comment) {
  if (
    context.payload.action === "created" ||
    context.payoad.action === "edited"
  ) {
    const issueNumber = context.payload.issue.number;
    const repository = context.payload.repository;
    const octokit = new github.GitHub(githubToken);
    const threshold = toxicityThreshold ? toxicityThreshold : 0.9;
    const model = await toxicity.load(threshold);
    const comments = [];
    const commentsObjects = [];
    const latestComment = [context.payload.comment.body];
    const latestCommentObject = context.payload.comment;
    let toxicComment = undefined;

    model.classify(latestComment).then((predictions) =&gt; {
      predictions.forEach((prediction) =&gt; {
        if (toxicComment) {
          return;
        }
        prediction.results.forEach((result, index) =&gt; {
          if (toxicComment) {
            return;
          }
          if (result.match) {
            const commentAuthor = latestCommentObject.user.login;
            toxicComment = latestComment;
            const message = customMessage
              ? customMessage
              : `&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdQ1IynzclJldUQ/giphy.gif" width="400"/&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
                                      Hey @${commentAuthor}! 👋 &lt;br/&gt; PRs and issues should be safe environments but your comment: &lt;strong&gt;"${toxicComment}"&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as potentially toxic! 😔&lt;/br&gt;
                                      Please consider spending a few seconds editing it and feel free to delete me afterwards! 🙂`;

            return octokit.issues.createComment({
              owner: repository.owner.login,
              repo: repository.name,
              issue_number: issueNumber,
              body: message,
            });
          }
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Creating a bot comment when a user submits a PR review</h3>
<p>The code to run checks on PR reviews is very similar, the main difference is in the first couple of lines. Instead of looking for the <code>comment</code> property on the payload, we look for <code>review</code>, and the action I am interested in is <code>submitted</code>.</p>
<pre><code>if (context.payload.review) {
  if (context.payload.action === "submitted") {
    const issueNumber = context.payload.pull_request.number;
    const repository = context.payload.repository;
    const octokit = new github.GitHub(githubToken);
    const threshold = toxicityThreshold ? toxicityThreshold : 0.9;
    const model = await toxicity.load(threshold);
    const reviewComment = [context.payload.review.body];
    const reviewObject = context.payload.review;
    let toxicComment = undefined;
    model.classify(reviewComment).then((predictions) =&gt; {
      predictions.forEach((prediction) =&gt; {
        if (toxicComment) {
          return;
        }
        prediction.results.forEach((result, index) =&gt; {
          if (toxicComment) {
            return;
          }
          if (result.match) {
            const commentAuthor = reviewObject.user.login;
            toxicComment = reviewComment[0];
            const message = customMessage
              ? customMessage
              : `&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdQ1IynzclJldUQ/giphy.gif" width="400"/&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
                                      Hey @${commentAuthor}! 👋 &lt;br/&gt; PRs and issues should be safe environments but your comment: &lt;strong&gt;"${toxicComment}"&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as potentially toxic! 😔&lt;/br&gt;
                                      Please consider spending a few seconds editing it and feel free to delete me afterwards! 🙂`;

            return octokit.issues.createComment({
              owner: repository.owner.login,
              repo: repository.name,
              issue_number: issueNumber,
              body: message,
            });
          }
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Using the action</h2>
<p>To use an action in a repository, we need to create a workflow file.</p>
<p>First, the repository needs to have a <code>.github</code> folder with a <code>workflows</code> folder inside. Then, we can add a new <code>.yml</code> file with the details for the action we want to run.</p>
<pre><code>on: [issue_comment, pull_request_review]

jobs:
  toxic_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Safe space
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Safe space - action step
        uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
</code></pre>
<p>In this code sample, we indicate that we want to trigger this action when events happen around comments in an issue and when a pull request review event happens.
Then, we add that we need to start by using the default <code>actions/checkout@v2</code> action and finally, add this toxicity classification action, with some additional parameters, including the required <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> one.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use the optional properties <code>message</code> and <code>toxicity_threshold</code>, you could do so like this:</p>
<pre><code>on: [issue_comment, pull_request_review]

jobs:
  toxic_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Safe space
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Safe space - action step
        uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          message: "Hello"
          toxicity_threshold: 0.7
</code></pre>
<p>If you are developing your own action, you can test it by changing the line</p>
<pre><code>uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>uses: ./
</code></pre>
<p>One important thing to note, if you want to build your own Github action, is that when using the action type <code>issue_comment</code> and <code>pull_request_review</code>, you need to push your code to your main (often called "master") branch before being able to test that your code is working in another branch. If you develop everything in a separate branch, the action will not be triggered when writing a comment or reviewing a PR.</p>
<p>And that's it! 🎉</p>
<h2>Potential improvements</h2>
<p>At the moment, I invite the user to delete manually the note from the bot once they've updated the content of their toxic comment, however, I think this could be done automatically on edit. When the user edits a comment, I could run the check again and if it is predicted as safe, remove automatically the bot comment so users don't have to do it.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>by Jonathan Latham, PhD and Allison Wilson, PhD</p>
<p>In all the discussions of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, enormous scientific attention has been paid to the molecular character of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including its novel genome sequence in comparison with its near relatives. In stark contrast, virtually no attention has been paid to the physical provenance of those nearest genetic relatives, its presumptive ancestors, which are two viral sequences named BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13.<span id="more-4485"></span></p>
<p>This neglect is surprising because their provenance is more than interesting. BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13 were collected from a mineshaft in Yunnan province, China, in 2012/2013 by researchers from the lab of Zheng-li Shi at the <a href="http://english.whiov.cas.cn/">Wuhan Institute of Virology</a> (WIV). Very shortly before, in the spring of 2012, six miners working in the mine had contracted a mysterious illness and three of them had died (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036791/">Wu et al., 2014</a>). The specifics of this mystery disease have been virtually forgotten; however, they are described in a Chinese Master’s thesis written in 2013 by a doctor who supervised their treatment.</p>
<p>We arranged to have this Master’s thesis translated into English. The evidence it contains has led us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also led us to theorise a plausible route by which an apparently isolated disease outbreak in a mine in 2012 led to a global pandemic in 2019.</p>
<p>The origin of SARS-CoV-2 that we propose below is based on the case histories of these miners and their hospital treatment. This simple theory accounts for all the key features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, including ones that have puzzled virologists since the outbreak began.</p>
<p>The theory can account for the origin of the polybasic furin cleavage site, which is a region of the viral spike protein that makes it susceptible to cleavage by the host enzyme furin and which greatly enhances viral spread in the body. This furin site is novel to SARS-CoV-2 compared to its near relatives (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114094/">Coutard, et al., 2020</a>). The theory also explains the exceptional affinity of the virus spike protein for human receptors, which has also surprised virologists (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0688-y?report=reader">Letko et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199.pdf">Piplani et al, 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2507">Wrapp et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.956581">Walls et al., 2020</a>). The theory further explains why the virus has barely evolved since the pandemic began, which is also a deeply puzzling aspect of a virus supposedly new to humans (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1">Zhan et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/22/2020.05.21.108506.full.pdf">van Dorp et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-020-00665-8">Chaw et al., 2020</a>). Lastly, the theory neatly explains why SARS-CoV-2 targets the lungs, which is unusual for a coronavirus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159299/">Huang et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>We do not propose a specifically genetically engineered or biowarfare origin for the virus but the theory does propose an essential causative role in the pandemic for scientific research carried out by the laboratory of Zheng-li Shi at the WIV; thus also explaining Wuhan as the location of the epicentre.</p>
<h4>Why has the provenance of RaTG13 and BtCoV/4991 been ignored?</h4>
<p>The apparent origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Wuhan is also home to the world’s leading research centre for bat coronaviruses. There are two virology labs in the city, <a href="https://project-evidence.github.io/">both have either collected bat coronaviruses or researched them</a> in the recent past. The Shi lab, which collected BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13, <a href="https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-AI110964-06">recently received grants</a> to evaluate <em>by experiment</em> the potential for pandemic pathogenicity of the novel bat coronaviruses they collected from the wild.</p>
<p>To add to these suggestive data points, there is a long history of accidents, disease outbreaks, and even pandemics resulting from lab accidents with viruses (<a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>; <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/26137650">Weiss et al., 2015</a>). For these and other reasons, summarised in our article <a href="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/"><em>The Case is Building that COVID-19 Had a Lab Origin</em></a>, we (a virologist and a geneticist) <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/06/did-the-sars-cov-2-virus-arise-from-a-bat-coronavirus-research-program-in-a-chinese-laboratory-very-possibly/">and others</a> have concluded that a lab outbreak is a credible thesis. Certainly, a lab origin has at least as much circumstantial evidence to support it as does any natural zoonotic origin theory (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199.pdf">Piplani et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rossana_Segreto/publication/340924249_Is_considering_a_genetic-manipulation_origin_for_SARS-CoV-2_a_conspiracy_theory_that_must_be_censored/links/5ed7c17992851c9c5e74f7dc/Is-considering-a-genetic-manipulation-origin-for-SARS-CoV-2-a-conspiracy-theory-that-must-be-censored.pdf">Segreto and Deigin, 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1">Zhan et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>The media, normally so enamoured of controversy, has largely declined even to debate the possibility of a laboratory escape. Many news sites have simply labelled it a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The principal reason for media dismissals of the lab origin possibility is a review paper in <em>Nature Medicine</em> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/S41591-020-0820-9">Andersen et al., 2020</a>). Although by Jun 29 2020 this review had almost 700 citations it also has major scientific shortcomings. These flaws are worth understanding in their own right but they are also useful background for understanding the implications of the Master’s thesis.</p>
<h4>Andersen et al., a critique</h4>
<p>The question of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is, in outline, simple. There are two incontrovertible facts. One, the disease is caused by a human viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 and whose RNA genome sequence is known. Second, all of its nearest known relatives come from bats. Beyond any reasonable doubt SARS-CoV-2 evolved from an ancestral bat virus. The task the <em>Nature Medicine</em> authors set for themselves was to establish the relative merits of each of the various possible routes (lab vs natural) by which a bat coronavirus might have jumped to humans and in the same process have acquired an unusual furin site and a spike protein having very high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>When Andersen et al. outline a natural zoonotic pathway they speculate extensively about how the leap might have occurred. In particular they elaborate on a proposed residence in intermediate animals, likely pangolins. For example, “The presence in pangolins of an RBD [Receptor Binding Domain] very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 means that we can infer that this was probably in the virus that jumped to humans. This leaves the insertion of [a] polybasic cleavage site to occur during human-to-human transmission.” This viral evolution occurred in “Malayan pangolins illegally imported into Guangdong province”. Even with these speculations there are major gaps in this theory. For example, why is the virus so well adapted to humans? Why Wuhan, which is 1,000 Km from Guangdong? (See map).</p>
<figure id="attachment_3105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3105"><img src="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/china-province-guide-600x503.jpg" alt="china province guide" width="600" height="503"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3105">china province guide</figcaption></figure>
<p>The authors provide no such speculations in favour of the lab accident thesis, only speculation <em>against</em> it:</p>
<p>“Finally, the generation of the <em>predicted</em> O-linked glycans is also <em>unlikely</em> to have occurred due to cell-culture passage, as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system.” (italics added).</p>
<p>[Passaging is the deliberate placing of live viruses into cells or organisms to which they are NOT adapted for the purpose of making them adapted, i.e. speeding up their evolution.]</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that the Andersen authors set a higher hurdle for the lab thesis than the zoonotic thesis. In their account, the lab thesis is required to explain <em>all </em>of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from its presumed bat viral ancestor, whereas under their telling of the zoonotic thesis the key step of the addition of the furin site is allowed to happen in humans and is thus effectively unexplained.</p>
<p>A further imbalance is that key information needed to judge the merits of a lab origin theory is missing from their account. As we detailed in our previous article, in their search for SARS-like viruses with zoonotic spillover potential, researchers at the WIV have passaged live bat viruses in monkey and human cells (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/4/379/htm">Wang et al., 2019</a>). They have also performed many recombinant experiments with diverse bat coronaviruses (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12711">Ge et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797993/">Menachery et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698">Hu et al., 2017</a>). Such experiments have generated international concern over the possible creation of potential pandemic viruses (<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_29">Lipsitch, 2018</a>). As we showed too, the Shi lab had also won a grant to extend that work to whole live animals. They planned “virus infection experiments across a range of cell cultures from different species and humanized mice” with recombinant bat coronaviruses. Yet Andersen et al did not discuss this research at all, except to say:</p>
<p>“Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the world”</p>
<p>This statement is fundamentally misleading about the kind of research performed at the Shi lab.</p>
<p>A further important oversight by the Andersen authors concerns the history of lab outbreaks of viral pathogens. They write: “there are documented instances of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV”. This is a rather matter-of-fact allusion to the fact that since 2003 there have been six documented outbreaks of SARS from labs, not all in China, with some leading to fatalities (<a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Andersen et al might have also have noted that two major human pandemics are widely accepted to have been caused by lab outbreaks of viral pathogens, H1N1 in 1977 and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (summarised in <a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>). Andersen could even have noted that literally hundreds of lab accidents with viruses have resulted in near-misses or very localised outbreaks (<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/02/human-error-in-high-biocontainment-labs-a-likely-pandemic-threat/">summarised by Lynn Klotz</a> and <a href="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-long-history-of-accidental-laboratory-releases-of-potential-pandemic-pathogens/">Sam Husseini</a> and also <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/26137650">Weiss et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p>Also unmentioned were instances where a lab outbreak of an experimental or engineered virus has been plausibly theorised but remains uninvestigated. For example, the most coherent explanation for the H1N1 variant ‘swine flu’ pandemic of 2009/10 that resulted in a death toll estimated by some as high as 200,000 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4865181/">Duggal et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001558">Simonsen et al. 2013</a>), is that a vaccine was improperly inactivated by its maker (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1743-422X-6-207">Gibbs et al., 2009</a>).

<p>I'm a science fiction writer, so I quite enjoy thinking about self-driving cars. They make for really interesting analogies about data, liability, self-determination, information security and openness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write fiction about this! Deakin University commissioned "Car Wars," a short story about the sociotechnological issues raised by autonomous vehicle thought-experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>(they also got a faculty member to write a quiz for it whose correct answers take a 180' different view to my own!)</p>
<p>And without any spoilers here, I'll say that subverted, lethal autonomous vehicles are a key plot point in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book, coming out in Oct.</p>
<p><a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/">https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/</a></p>
<p>But I'm a science fiction writer and that means I can tell the difference between "thought experiments" and "real things." Alas, the same cannot be said of corporate America.</p>
<p>For example, according to its own IPO filings, Uber can only be profitable if it invents fully autonomous vehicles and replaces every public transit ride in the world with them.</p>
<p>Elon Musk – a man whose "green electric car company" is only profitable thanks to the carbon credits it sells to manufacturers of the dirtiest SUVs in America, without which those planet-killing SUVs would not exist – makes the same mistake.</p>
<p>Musk wants to abolish public transit and replace it with EVs (he says that public transit makes you sit next to strangers who might be serial killers, which tells you a lot about his view of humanity).</p>
<p>Now, both Uber and Musk are both wrong as a matter of simple geometry. Multiply the space occupied by all those AVs by the journeys people in cities need to make by the additional distances of those journeys if we need road for all those cars, and you run out of space.</p>
<p>It's a trivially modelable Red Queen's Race, in which the more cars you add, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need…</p>
<p>Indeed, these fairy tales require so much credulity to be taken seriously that they strain even the car-addled imaginations of American automotive culture, and also rely on the irrational exuberance inspired by imaginary self-driving cars to propagate and persist.</p>
<p>But that exuberance is sorely misplaced. Machine learning systems have brittle and unpredictable failure modes that can be triggered by accident or deliberately. The unconstrained problem of navigating busy cities with unquantifiable human activities is insoluble with ML.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it's insoluble if you care about whether cars kill even more people in even less predictable ways than they do now.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Ford CEO Jim Hackett just learned the hard way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html">https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html</a></p>
<p>After investing heavily in the technology and boasting about how Ford's future was a bet on the imminent arrival of AVs, Hackett has had to admit that "We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The company has sunk $4b into the technology. But there's gotta be a pony under there somewhere:</p>
<p>"When we bring this thing to market, it's going to be really powerful." -Hackett</p>

<p>Genomist Adam Rutherford is a gifted science communicator; the podcast he co-hosts, "The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry" is one of the best popular science programs I've ever heard: charming and informative at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads</a></p>
<p>His 2017 book "A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived" used a survey of the state of the art in genomics to present an account of what we knew about human relatedness.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html</a></p>
<p>The most compelling part of "Brief History" was Rutherford's skewering of junk DNA sciecne, especially the home ancestry/genetic testing industry, with its claims of being able to tell you if you're 32% viking and if so, which red wine you're genetically programmed to enjoy.</p>
<p>These sections are written with Rutherford's characteristic empathy – as someone who'd dedicated his life to genomics, he understands the impulse to connect your DNA with your life story – but they also warn about the harms arising from these false beliefs.</p>
<p>These harms are the subject of his new book, HOW TO ARGUE WITH A RACIST, a bestseller in the UK, just published in the US with new forematter updated in light of both the pandemic and the BLM uprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/">https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/</a></p>
<p>Superficially, the "race science" promulgated by white supremacists – often repeated by people who should know better, sometimes internalized by racialized people who are harmed by this pseudoscience – has the ring of plausibility.</p>
<p>Whether that's the fairy tales about "race" and ability ("Jews are smart because of medieval money-lending laws" or "Black people perform well in sports because of the slave trade's selective breeding") or the studies grouping humanity into races based on genetic divergence.</p>
<p>Chances are you've encountered this stuff and not known what to make of it but thought it benign or at least neutral. But sociologists have scraped white nationalist message-boards to document the centrality of this stuff to the rise of a new movement of would-be genociders.</p>
<p>"How to Argue" is a point-by-point rebuttal to these race realists. Despite the title, Rutherford doesn't really expect that you'll convince someone who's obsessed with whether they have "Jewish genes" or who worships their ability to break down lactose with his arguments.</p>
<p>Those people, after all, are motivated reasoners. They've started from the end-point – "appearances and life circumstances notwithstanding, I am superior and deserve better" – and worked their way backwards to justify that story to themselves.</p>
<p>As Jonathan Swift wrote (and as Rutherford quotes): "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."</p>
<p>But it's not just motivated reasoners who absorb this garbage. There's a whole business model built on selling people junk DNA science that makes "race science" regrettably spreadable.</p>
<p>That's where Rutherford is aiming: people who've assumed that 23andme and its rivals wouldn't be able to make millions selling you diagnoses of the precise quantity of viking DNA in your blood if there wasn't something to it.</p>
<p>And here Rutherford shines. He is, after all, a gifted science communicator. This is one seriously <em>charming</em> book, funny and witty and just flat-out fascinating.</p>
<p>Rutherford doesn't merely want to disabuse you of the fantastical claims of Junk DNA Science – he wants to excite you about the incredible NEW things we're learning thanks to the rapid advances in genomics.</p>
<p>Like the fact that Africa is the most genetically diverse place on Earth, with two members of the Sen tribe from different regions being more genetically divergent than a Swede and an Australian Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>And the fact that you only need to go back 11 generations before you reach an ancestor whose DNA is likely completely missing from your own genome. Or the small number of centuries you have to look back before you find the first common ancestor of every European.</p>
<p>And the amount of genetic outflow and backflow between seemingly isolated places – Bronze Age Africa and Europe, say – and the waves of migration we can trace through genomes that eliminate any claim to national genetic commonality in any land.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what role genomics plays in the dominance of people from east Africa in footraces, or the number of Jewish Nobelists, Rutherford's here for you, unpicking what we know about the role of genes in these attainments (spoiler: they're not that important).</p>
<p>All leavened with gentle and devastating dunks on "race science" believers and the wit of Douglas Adams in his prime.</p>
<p>It may not help you win arguments with racists – they cannot be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into.</p>
<p>But it a powerful innoculant against the ideas drifting out of their foetid pits and into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The Heroes Without Limits project was created by disability advocate Sara Thompson, "producing and streaming real play tabletop games with an all-disabled/chronically ill/neurodivergent cast and crew."</p>
<p>Thompson's work also includes creating homebrew RPG add-ons "roleplay and address disability" in your own games.</p>
<p>A recent addition is the Combat Wheelchair, rules for integrating wheelchair using adventurers into your Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition games:</p>

<p>The chair comes with its own attacks and added capabilities – like being able to fix a weapon in place on it and ramming/tyre striking your adversaries, or high-speed descents on sloped terrain.</p>
<p>The docs also come with a new character class, "The Paralympian."</p>

<p>Combat Wheelchairs' obvious, manifest coolness has not prevented gatekeeping yum-yukkers from raising spurious objections to them, and these are addressed in the homebrew rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>But far more interesting than Combat Wheelchairs' detractors are its boosters, who have unleashed a torrent of delightful and creative new media building on Thompson's work.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927202.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927202.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

</p>
<p><em> <strong>Content warning:</strong> Discussion of social justice, discussion of violence, spoilers for Jacqueline Carey books.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p><em> <strong>Edit 10/25:</strong> This post was inspired by a debate with a friend of a friend on Facebook who has since become somewhat famous. I’ve renamed him here to “Andrew Cord” to protect his identity.</em>
</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Andrew Cord <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/02/on-some-criticism-of-lesswrong/" rel="nofollow">criticizes me</a> for my bold and controversial suggestion that maybe people should try to tell slightly fewer blatant hurtful lies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just find it kind of darkly amusing and sad that the “rationalist community” loves “rationality is winning” so much as a tagline and yet are clearly not winning. And then complain about losing rather than changing their tactics to match those of people who are winning.
</p>
<p>Which is probably because if you *really* want to be the kind of person who wins you have to actually care about winning something, which means you have to have politics, which means you have to embrace “politics the mindkiller” and “politics is war and arguments are soldiers”, and Scott would clearly rather spend the rest of his life losing than do this.
</p>
<p>That post [ <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/17/lies-damned-lies-and-social-media-part-5-of-%e2%88%9e/" rel="nofollow">the one debunking false rape statistics</a> ] is exactly my problem with Scott. He seems to honestly think that it’s a worthwhile use of his time, energy and mental effort to download evil people’s evil worldviews into his mind and try to analytically debate them with statistics and cost-benefit analyses.
</p>
<p>He gets *mad* at people whom he detachedly intellectually agrees with but who are willing to back up their beliefs with war and fire rather than pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense.
</p>
<p>It honestly makes me kind of sick. It is exactly the kind of thing that “social justice” activists like me *intend* to attack and “trigger” when we use “triggery” catchphrases about the mewling pusillanimity of privileged white allies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a fight is important to you, fight nasty. If that means lying, lie. If that means insults, insult. If that means silencing people, silence.
</p>
<p>It always makes me happy when my ideological opponents come out and say eloquently and openly what I’ve always secretly suspected them of believing.
</p>
<p>My natural instinct is to give some of the reasons why I think Andrew is wrong, starting with the history of the “noble lie” concept and moving on to some examples of why it didn’t work very well, and why it might not be expected to work so well in the future.
</p>
<p>But in a way, that would be assuming the conclusion. I wouldn’t be showing respect for Andrew’s arguments. I wouldn’t be going halfway to meet them on their own terms.
</p>
<p>The respectful way to rebut Andrew’s argument would be to spread malicious lies about Andrew to a couple of media outlets, fan the flames, and wait for them to destroy his reputation. Then if the stress ends up bursting an aneurysm in his brain, I can dance on his grave, singing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>♪ ♬ I won this debate in a very effective manner. Now you can’t argue in favor of nasty debate tactics any more ♬ ♪
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to do that, but if I <em>did</em> it’s unclear to me how Andrew could object. I mean, he thinks that sexism is detrimental to society, so spreading lies and destroying people is justified in order to stop it. I think that discourse based on mud-slinging and falsehoods is detrimental to society. Therefore…
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But really, all this talk of lying and spreading rumors about people is – what was Andrew’s terminology – “pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense”. You know who got things done? The IRA. They didn’t agree with the British occupation of Northern Ireland and they weren’t afraid to let people know in that very special way only a nail-bomb shoved through your window at night can.
</p>
<p>Why not assassinate prominent racist and sexist politicians and intellectuals? I won’t name names since that would be crossing a line, but I’m sure you can generate several of them who are sufficiently successful and charismatic that, if knocked off, there would not be an equally competent racist or sexist immediately available to replace them, and it would thus be a serious setback for the racism/sexism movement.
</p>
<p>Other people can appeal to “the social contract” or “the general civilizational rule not to use violence”, but not Andrew:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And don’t give me that nonsense about the police. I’m sure a smart person like you can think of clever exciting new ways to commit the perfect murder. Unless you do not believe there will <em>ever</em> be an opportunity to defect unpunished, you need this sort of social contract to take you at least some of the way.
</p>
<p>He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Scott calls rhetorical tactics he dislikes “bullets” and denigrates them it actually hilariously plays right into this point…to be “pro-bullet” or “anti-bullet” is ridiculous. Bullets, as you say, are neutral. I am in favor of my side using bullets as best they can to destroy the enemy’s ability to use bullets.
</p>
<p>In a war, a real war, a war for survival, you use all the weapons in your arsenal because you assume the enemy will use all the weapons in theirs. Because you understand that it IS a war.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things I am tempted to say to this.
</p>
<p>Like “And that is why the United States immediately nukes every country it goes to war with.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why the Geneva Convention was so obviously impossible that no one even bothered to attend the conference”.
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/apart-from-better-sanitation-and-medicine-and-education-and-irrigation-and-public-health-and-roads-and-public-order-what-has-modernity-done-for-us/" rel="nofollow">to this very day</a>, we solve every international disagreement through total war.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why Martin Luther King was immediately reduced to a nonentity, and we remember the Weathermen as the sole people responsible for the success of the civil rights movement”
</p>
<p>But I think what I am <em>actually</em> going to say is that, for the love of God, if you like bullets so much, stop using them as a metaphor for ‘spreading false statistics’ and go buy a gun.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>So let’s derive why violence is not in fact The One True Best Way To Solve All Our Problems. You can get most of this from <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1619491702/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1619491702&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slastacod-20&amp;linkId=AYGYZKSORVSJ52VW" rel="nofollow">Hobbes</a>, but this blog post will be shorter.
</p>
<p>Suppose I am a radical Catholic who believes all Protestants deserve to die, and therefore go around killing Protestants. So far, so good.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there might be some radical Protestants around who believe all Catholics deserve to die. If there weren’t before, there probably are now. So they go around killing Catholics, we’re both unhappy and/or dead, our economy tanks, hundreds of innocent people end up as collateral damage, and our country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So we make an agreement: I won’t kill any more Catholics, you don’t kill any more Protestants. The specific Irish example was called the Good Friday Agreement and the general case is called “civilization”.
</p>
<p>So then I try to destroy the hated Protestants using the government. I go around trying to pass laws banning Protestant worship and preventing people from condemning Catholicism.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, maybe the next government in power is a Protestant government, and they pass laws banning Catholic worship and preventing people from condemning Protestantism. No one can securely practice their own religion, no one can learn about other religions, people are constantly plotting civil war, academic freedom is severely curtailed, and once again the country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So again we make an agreement. I won’t use the apparatus of government against Protestantism, you don’t use the apparatus of government against Catholicism. The specific American example is the First Amendment and the general case is called “liberalism”, or to be dramatic about it, “civilization 2.0”.
</p>
<p>Every case in which both sides agree to lay down their weapons and be nice to each other has corresponded to spectacular gains by both sides and a new era of human flourishing.
</p>
<p>“Wait a second, no!” someone yells. “I see where you’re going with this. You’re going to say that agreeing not to spread malicious lies about each other would also be a civilized and beneficial system. Like maybe the Protestants could stop saying that the Catholics worshipped the Devil, and the Catholics could stop saying the Protestants hate the Virgin Mary, and they could both relax the whole thing about the Jews baking the blood of Christian children into their matzah.
</p>
<p>“But your two examples were about contracts written on paper and enforced by the government. So maybe a ‘no malicious lies’ amendment to the Constitution would work if it were enforceable, <em>which it isn’t</em>, but just <em>asking</em> people to stop spreading malicious lies is doomed from the start. The Jews will no doubt spread lies against <em>us</em>, so if we stop spreading lies about them, all we’re doing is abandoning an effective weapon against a religion I personally know to be heathenish! Rationalists should win, so put the blood libel on the front page of every newspaper!”
</p>
<p>Or, as Andrew puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s talk about how beneficial game-theoretic equilibria can come to exist even in the absence of centralized enforcers. I know of two main ways: reciprocal communitarianism, and divine grace.
</p>
<p>Reciprocal communitarianism is probably how altruism evolved. Some mammal started running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat" rel="nofollow">TIT-FOR-TAT</a>, the program where you cooperate with anyone whom you expect to cooperate with you. Gradually you form a successful community of cooperators. The defectors either join your community and agree to play by your rules or get outcompeted.
</p>
<p>Divine grace is more complicated. I was tempted to call it “spontaneous …</p></div></div>

August 17, 2020 | https://www.embly.run/star/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.embly.run/star/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><em><strong>tl:dr</strong> <a href="https://github.com/embly/star"><strong>star</strong></a> is a python(ish) programming environment that lets you call Go library functions. <a href="https://www.embly.run/star/#repl">click down to the repl</a> if you'd just like to play around</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a> is Google's custom subset of Python that it uses as a configuration language with Bazel. I started looking into it a little because it has some interesting characteristics. It's not turing complete (no unbounded loops), it doesn't have classes or higher level abstractions, it's also deterministic and is somewhat safe to run untrusted user input.</p>
<p>Although somewhat limited it felt like it might make a good candidate for a serverless function runtime that could be added to <a href="https://embly.run/">embly</a>. Easier to sandbox, could mock out pieces of the python standard library, maybe provide just enough functionality for it to be useful. I also thought you might be able to identify the deterministic blocks of code and replace them with the static result on subsequent runs. Potentially exciting stuff!</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/google/starlark-go">starlark-go</a> to get started and pretty quickly had this demo up and running:</p>
<pre><span>def </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>, </span><span>req</span><span>):
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>(req.content_type)
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>(req.path)
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>("</span><span>\n</span><span>Hello World</span><span>\n</span><span>" + </span><span>str</span><span>([x </span><span>for </span><span>x </span><span>in </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)]) + "</span><span>\n</span><span>")

    </span><span>return
</span></pre>
<p>The server parses the file, starts a web server, takes the <code>hello</code> function and passes the <code>http.ResponseWriter</code> and <code>http.Request</code> over to the <strike>python</strike> starlark side of things on every http request. From there I could add attributes to pass over things like the <code>path</code> and <code>content_type</code>.</p>
<p>Starlark doesn't have exception handling, so I add a Go error type and passed that over as well. This ends up being almost as verbose as Go, but without typed functions it does allow for a little more flexibility:</p>
<pre><span>def </span><span>handle_err</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>):
    </span><span>for </span><span>a </span><span>in </span><span>args:
        </span><span>if </span><span>type</span><span>(a) == "</span><span>error</span><span>" and a:
            </span><span>print</span><span>(a, a.</span><span>stacktrace</span><span>())
    </span><span>return </span><span>args

foo, err = </span><span>handle_err</span><span>(</span><span>function_call</span><span>())
</span></pre>
<p>At this point I got a little more interested in continuing to cram Go functionality into this scripting language. The <a href="https://github.com/google/starlark-go">starlark-go</a> implementation is really wonderful and it was quite easy to extend.</p>
<p>In talking to my coworker I wondered if you could pull in lots of Go functionality, we sketched up something like this:</p>
<pre><span>import </span><span>time
</span><span>from </span><span>net </span><span>import </span><span>http
</span><span>from </span><span>star </span><span>import </span><span>chan, go

</span><span>def </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>):
    time.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)
    c.</span><span>push</span><span>("</span><span>hello</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>main</span><span>():
    resp, err = http.</span><span>get</span><span>("</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>")
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)

    c = </span><span>chan</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)
    </span><span>go</span><span>(foo, c)
    c.</span><span>next</span><span>()
</span></pre>
<p>From a syntax standpoint it seems like this would be possible. Starlark also has first-class support for running separate chunks of code in parallel (globals are immutable, which helps), so leveraging Go's concurrency model didn't seem too difficult either.</p>
<p>After a little more messing around, most of that sketch has been implemented: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star">https://github.com/embly/star</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/embly/star"><strong>star</strong></a> is a python(ish) programming environment that lets you call Go library functions. It is very fragile and shouldn't be taken seriously, but it's very fun to play with.</p>
<p>Here's what that sketch ended up looking like:</p>
<pre><span>http = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>net/http</span><span>")
ioutil = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>io/ioutil</span><span>")
sync = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>sync</span><span>")
star = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>star</span><span>")
time = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>time</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>get_url</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>, </span><span>wg</span><span>):
    resp, err = http.</span><span>Get</span><span>(url)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    b, err = ioutil.</span><span>ReadAll</span><span>(resp.Body)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    body, err = star.</span><span>bytes_to_string</span><span>(b)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    time.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(time.Second * </span><span>2</span><span>)
    wg.</span><span>Done</span><span>()


</span><span>def </span><span>main</span><span>():
    wg = sync.</span><span>WaitGroup</span><span>()
    wg.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)
    urls = [
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
    ]
    </span><span>for </span><span>url </span><span>in </span><span>urls:
        star.</span><span>go</span><span>(get_url, url, wg)
    wg.</span><span>Wait</span><span>()
</span></pre>
<p>Really trippy to look at if you've written python and Go. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>starlark doesn't support python's import syntax, so I went with a <code>require</code> function</li>
<li><code>star.go</code> spawns a goroutine and it works! adding channels wouldn't be too hard either</li>
<li><code>star.bytes_to_string</code> shows some of the cracks, I wasn't too sure how to add type conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>I've only converted a small subset of the Go stdlib, you can see the list of available components here: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/master/src/packages.go">https://github.com/embly/star/blob/master/src/packages.go</a></p>
<p>I also got a callback function working so that go/python servers work as well:</p>
<pre><span>http = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>net/http</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>, </span><span>req</span><span>):
    w.</span><span>WriteHeader</span><span>(</span><span>201</span><span>)
    w.</span><span>Write</span><span>("</span><span>hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>")

http.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>("</span><span>/hello</span><span>", hello)

http.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>("</span><span>:8080</span><span>", http.Handler)
</span></pre>
<p>The coolest part is that this is all pure Go, so we can also run all of it in webassembly. Here's <a href="https://embly.github.io/star/">a repl</a>, script away:</p>

<p>Or install with <code>go get github.com/embly/star/cmd/star</code></p>
<h4 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h4>
<p>I originally though I could generate wrappers for the entire standard library. There has been a <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/tree/master/cmd/nebula">very small amount of work</a> made toward this effort and the wrapper functions have been written with generation in mind. In an <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/io/lib.go">optimistic case</a> you can see how you could crawl the stdlib AST and generate the necessary code. From there you just populate <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/packages.go">the mappings</a> and you're off. I thought it would be cool if you could chose what libraries and functions to include with star and generate your own binary so that you don't have to compile things you don't need.</p>
<p>Sadly, the current implementation is <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/net/http/lib.go#L85-L105">full of edge cases</a>, so either the wrappers need a rewrite (probably true), or the generation code would need to be quite complex (maybe also true).</p>
<p>I've also left out a lot of important things, the idea of a pointer isn't really tracked, some values are pointers and some are not, this would need to be surfaced in star on some level.</p>
<p>No work has been done to soften the edge cases of passing things into Go, but conceivably this could be very nice. Star could make the best effort to convert any starlark/python type into the correct input type for a function. For the moment it will just crash.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts, please open an issue: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/issues">https://github.com/embly/star/issues</a></p>

        <blockquote><p>Just because your state or city allows you to bring staff back to the office doesn’t mean that the facilities are ready for them to work safely. Here’s what you need to consider before employees return – assuming you can convince them to do so. Don’t count on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a now-common tale: The developers and the rest of the company staff have been working at home since March. For the most part, things have gone well enough. After <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-qa-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">some initial glitches</a>, the team is productive, reasonably happy (given the additional stress), and their goals are met.</p>
<p>However, the day is coming when you no longer have to keep everyone out of the office. You can bring them back. Or can you?</p>
<h3>Decorating the petri dish</h3>
<p>Before you bring staff back to a shared space, you have to comply with a new bunch of rules about office work to meet post-covid-19 guidelines. While the specific details may differ where you are, all of the new workplace rules include social distancing requirements. Almost certainly, your pre-covid-19 workplace doesn’t allow for six feet of space between workers.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t trivial. You need <a href="https://theconversation.com/goodbye-to-the-crowded-office-how-coronavirus-will-change-the-way-we-work-together-137382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical reconfiguration of work areas</a>. Desks need to be farther apart, possibly with barriers between work stations. (So much for <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/sgc-research-when-moving-to-an-open-office-plan-pay-attention-to-how-your-employees-feel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the alleged benefits of collaboration</a> in an open office.) Because you probably don’t have space to move everyone apart, you need to decide whether you need everyone in the office at the same time – which means cultural impacts that are as important to think about as building airflow.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for the moment that you <em>do</em> want to bring people back into the corporate headquarters – or that you need to, for reasons of security. Here are the adjustments to make now, before people return to their commutes.</p>
<h3>Beyond office space</h3>
<p>According to Marina Vaamonde, CEO of real estate investment firm <a href="https://propertycashin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PropertyCashin.com</a>, companies have to arrange for more parking than they had pre-Covid. The reason, she explains, is that <a href="https://time.com/5869375/public-transit-coronavirus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer workers are willing to share space on public transportation</a>. “People want to drive their own cars into work, so you need more parking,” she points out.</p>
<p>The office itself needs <a href="https://vicuspartners.com/articles/6-office-design-trends-post-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant redesign</a>. “You need to have airflow and outdoor space,” Vaamonde explains. “Now that all of the communal indoor spaces are closed or used for offices, people want to have an outdoor area where they can meet and breathe fresh air.”</p>
<p>In fact, says Giridhara Raam M, product evangelist at <a href="https://www.zohocorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoho Corporation</a>, protecting employees requires a complete rethinking of the office itself. “Considering most of the work spaces operate with a centralized air conditioning system, it is better to avoid it. Work spaces need to be redefined; cubicle systems and socially distanced seating spots with free air flow should be adopted at least for a year. Open offices are even more satisfying than closed spaces, due to droplets.”</p>
<p>The physical configuration of the office has to change. “Cubicles are coming to an end,” Vaamonde says, because they don’t allow for social distancing.</p>
<p>But while barriers can be built around the cubicles, Vaamonde believes they won’t be necessary. The employees won’t be there to use them.</p>
<p>Expect big central offices, such as the ones in downtown Houston where Vaamonde works, to remain mostly empty. Employers may move to smaller offices in the suburbs, she predicts. “They will be more like coworking spaces where you have spaces for a day.” The newly-envisioned office will have more open space, providing larger areas where social distancing can be maintained.</p>
<p>All that assumes your employees are ready to come into the office, however. Don’t count on that.</p>
<h3>You might <em>want</em> employees to return to the office. Good luck with that plan</h3>
<p>Your staff has been <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-human-backup-establishing-the-teams-unlikely-successors/">working at home for nearly six months</a>. Many of those people are disinterested in coming back to an office for work. Others may feel that they only need to come into the physical plant occasionally, when they need access to services that are only available in the office, such as a specific test platform that can’t be reached via a cloud connection. And with so many cloud services nowadays, those are rare.</p>
<p>Sarah Riegelhuth, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.growmyteam.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grow My Team</a>, which specializes in hiring and engaging remote professionals, thinks that the ultimate resolution is for workforces to be mostly remote. “This allows people to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/5/15/21258793/bay-area-exodus-silicon-valley-san-francisco-facebook-google-apple-twitter-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live where they want to be</a>,” she says. It also permits flexible schedules, and other practices that enable staff to be more productive. (One reason: less time lost in social interactions.)</p>
<h3>Still: Some jobs do require on-site participation</h3>
<p>Businesses were forced to accept telework due to the pandemic. But that doesn’t mean everyone in every company can work from home in the long term. Manufacturing jobs, field support, and many service jobs must be done where the work actually is. Employees who deal with intellectual property and personally identifiable information may need to schedule their work so they address sensitive data on their few days in the office.</p>
<p>And there are other factors. This includes choosing which job functions should return to work first.</p>
<p>“Only the data critical roles should return back to corporate premises first, due to security concerns,” says Raam. “Others can stay back and facilitate remote work.” The critical resources can work in shifts assuring there are limited people inside a defined area.</p>
<p>In many cases, the end result is likely to be a mix of in-office workers and people continuing to work from their couches.</p>
<p>Ready or not, you have to change operations to deal with employees who will work at home permanently. Your management, HR, and IT systems need to adjust to a higher percentage of full-time telecommuters, for whom working from home is a better option. It’s your job to find a way to make that work.</p>
<p>That has a significant impact on office IT systems. For example, redefined work spaces mean that workstation locations will change, which affects how office computers connect to the network even if everything is wireless.</p>
<p>Likewise, the business needs to bring communication and security requirements for remote workers up to corporate standards. This may mean providing dedicated lines for employees who don’t have home internet service. Or the company may need to pay for a level of service beyond what the employee might otherwise need. Or a better chair.</p>
<p>Once you admit that the work-at-home phase isn’t temporary, the company may need to provide computers and software if employees are currently using personal computers or laptops. One reason is physical security. When employees use their own computers for work, it’s hard to prevent them from using the same devices for everything from their family’s homework to grocery shopping. The business computer needs client security and communications security products, such as corporate-grade VPNs, firewalls, or network security equipment.</p>
<h3>Split culture</h3>
<p>Finally, there’s the question about how corporate culture affects workers when they’re at home. Office politics will change, if only because it’s hard to get people involved in back-stabbing when their backs are back at home. “The reality is that there’s still a culture,” Riegelhuth says. “In my experience, the culture evolves.”</p>
<p>In many cases, some parts of the corporate culture, notably office politics, are diminished, which helps productivity. In others, such as the informal back channels that help decision making, the impact on the culture may be problematic. But Riegelhuth notes that there are ways to keep back channels and brain storming alive.</p>
<p>“We have a vision, we have a purpose and we have our values. We have a weekly team meeting where everybody comes on to Zoom,” Riegelhuth says. “We get an hour of face time every week.”</p>
<p>“One of the advantages that we’ve seen is looking at our health and wellbeing,” Riegelhuth adds. “Taking sick days used to be frowned on. It used to be a badge of honor not to take sick days.” Now, she says, the company culture has changed to make health and wellbeing important parts of her company’s culture.</p>
<p>There’s a general agreement among both managers and experts that remote working is here to stay. While some employees will always need to be in the building, most won’t. And in many cases, the company will organize itself so that it functions solely online. Some employees need to come to the office occasionally, some on a regular basis and a few most of the time.</p>
<p>But for office workers, the daily 9 – 5 in the building is a thing of the past. It may take some organizations a while to figure that out, but home will be where the heart, and the job, is.</p>
<blockquote><p>While you’re making changes, contemplate the who-does-what questions. For example, have you considered creating a Chief Quality Officer? <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Our white paper</a> goes into the details.</p></blockquote>

In this series, I will be going through a step-by-step tutorial on how you can plan, design and build your very own REST API using Node.js!</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-">Before we start...</h3>
<p>Some prerequisites you need to follow along:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginner to intermediate knowledge in JavaScript</li>
<li>Basic understanding of what REST APIs are</li>
<li>Basic understanding of back-end programming and Node.js</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="heads-up-some-tools-we-will-use-">Heads up! Some tools we will use:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code or any text editor</li>
<li>POSTman</li>
<li>Node.js and express</li>
<li>MongoDB Atlas</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, you<strong> just need to have a text editor installed</strong> in your computer. I'll explain how to install the rest in this series.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-planning-our-t-api">Step 1: Planning our T-API</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we will be making a simple API for tea (so random I know). I call it <strong>T-API</strong> because it sounds like "Tea API".</p>
<p>To plan an API, we must first understand what we want it to do. We can write down <strong>user stories</strong> to help us determine what we need in our API design.</p>
<h3 id="our-t-api-user-stories">Our T-API User Stories</h3>
<ol>
<li>I can create a new tea object and add it to the database</li>
<li>I can get all the tea from the database</li>
<li>I can delete all the tea in the database</li>
<li>I can get a single tea by querying its name</li>
<li>I can post a comment to a single tea</li>
<li>I can delete a single tea from the database</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="our-tea-object">Our Tea Object</h3>
<p>Based on our user stories and how we want to use the API, we can draft a sample tea object that the API can return. This helps us to decide what properties to include in the object early in the stage of making this API. So, for T-API, a tea object might look like:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "<span>name</span>": <span>"Jasmine Tea"</span>,
    "<span>image</span>": <span>"an image file url"</span>,
    "<span>description</span>": <span>"Jasmine tea (茉莉花茶) is tea scented with the aroma of jasmine blossoms."</span>,
    "<span>keywords</span>": <span>"aromatic, china, sweet"</span>,
    "<span>origin</span>":<span>"China"</span>,
    "<span>brew time</span>": <span>2</span>,
    "<span>temperature</span>": <span>80</span>,
    "<span>comments</span>": []
}
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2-designing-structure-for-t-api">Step 2: Designing Structure for T-API</h2>
<p>The way to design an API is to visualize its <strong>routes</strong> and <strong>request methods</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood what we want T-API to do for us, we can come up with a design like so:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Routes</td><td>HTTP Methods</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>GET</td><td>Displays all tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>POST</td><td>Creates a new tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes all tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>GET</td><td>Displays a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>POST</td><td>Adds a comment to a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Okay, we have planned and designed our T-API, let's get started with setting up the project!</p>
<h2 id="step-3-install-node-js-and-npm">Step 3: Install Node.js and npm</h2>
<p>Download Node.js (with npm) at: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">nodejs.org/en/download</a></p>
<p>After it is installed, to check if it is there, go to your command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>node -v
<span>npm</span> -v
</code></pre><h2 id="step-4-initialize-project">Step 4: Initialize project</h2>
<p>Create a new project file and in the root directory, initialize npm by running the following code in the command line:</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span>
</code></pre><p>Answer the questions that follow and a <code>package.json</code> file will be created.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-install-express">Step 5: Install express</h2>
<p>Let's install <strong>express</strong> and save it to our <code>package.json</code> by running:</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>install</span> 
</code></pre><h2 id="step-6-create-server">Step 6: Create server</h2>
<p>Now, we create a <code>server.js</code> file in our project's root directory to take care of the back-end. First, we have to create an Express app with:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> express = <span>require</span>(<span>"express"</span>);
<span>const</span> app = express();
</code></pre><p>Now we can add the code after:</p>
<pre><code>app.<span>use</span>(express.json()); 
</code></pre><p>Then, below it, our listener to ask our server to listen for a request. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> listener = app.listen(process.env.PORT || <span>3000</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'App is listening on port '</span> + listener.address().port)
})
</code></pre><p>By default, we want to listen on port 3000. However, in cases where the port number is designated from an environment variable, the app will listen on <code>process.env.PORT</code>.</p>
<h2 id="try-a-test-run-">Try a test run!</h2>
<p>So now that we have our server.js set up, let's try running the server by entering </p>
<pre><code><span>node</span> <span>server</span><span>.js</span>
</code></pre><p>into the command line. If it works, you should see the console outputs a message telling you which port it is listening to.</p>

<h3 id="before-we-wrap-up-i-have-a-question-">Before we wrap up, I have a question...</h3>
<p>In order to make this series as beginner-friendly as possible, I added a "Glossary" right below a potentially unfamiliar word to explain it (i.e. express, middleware, etc). Do you like this structure or do you prefer all Glossary terms to be at the end of an article? Please let me know in the comments. Thanks!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: A kind reader told me to put all the glossary at the end, so please find it at the end of this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="that-s-all-for-now-">That's all for now!</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading the first article of the series. Technically, I can write about building a REST API into 1 article but it will be too long and I will have to leave out a lot of important details which may confuse code newbies. </p>
<p>I hope this has been a helpful read for you. Be sure to <strong>like, share this article and stay tuned</strong> for the next part where we will start creating our routes and setting up our database in Mongo Atlas! In the meantime, please <strong>ask any questions</strong> in the comments below and read up on the frameworks/concepts/technologies in this article to accelerate your learning. Till next time, cheers!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<p>Here are some potentially unfamiliar words I have used in this article. Feel free to read slowly and read the suggested articles for further details.</p>
<h3 id="user-stories">user stories</h3>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">Wikipedia</a>, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system.</p>
<h3 id="routes">routes</h3>
<p>Routes are represented as URIs in REST APIs. For example, the index route for an API is '/'. Other routes will be built on it such as '/names' for a route that returns all names or '/pages' for one that returns all pages. 
Read up on basic routing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="request-methods">request methods</h3>
<p>Request methods refer to the HTTP methods which specifies the desired action the browser wants to do with the server. Read my article on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lo-victoria.com/the-basics-of-http-request-methods-ckb1noib903iel6s1582lccg9">Basics of HTTP Requests</a> for more details. </p>
<h3 id="express">express</h3>
<p>Express is web framework for Node.js to allow easy and robust routing for back-end development. It will be used to create our routes and handle our HTTP requests and any <strong>middleware</strong> for our API. You can read more in its documentation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://expressjs.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="middleware">middleware</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594942772687/f1tkx-LGQ.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="middleware.png"></p>
<p>A middleware essentially refers to the software that sits between the client-side requests and the server-side resource. It handles data, provide API management, messaging services as well as authentication. For more information, read up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">here</a>.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why an increasing number of programs are configured by placing small files in <code>.d</code> directories instead of by just editing a single file?</p>

<p>… while a fresh installation of the more traditional NetBSD barely shows any:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">netbsd:/etc&gt; ls -ld *.d */*.d
drwxr-xr-x  <span>2</span> root  wheel   <span>512</span> Aug  <span>9</span> <span>07</span>:43 fonts/conf.d

netbsd:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>What’s up with that? The reason is simple:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supporting configuration updates as part of first-class package management.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why do <code>.d</code> directories help? Let’s first look at a couple of examples to understand how these directories work and then we’ll get into the why.</p>



<p>To understand how configuration directories work, let’s look at a particular example that exists across the two systems we are looking at. That is the mechanism to apply <code>sysctl</code> configuration changes.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with it, <code>sysctl</code> is a tool <em>and</em> an interface to tune kernel-level settings. On Linux, the <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sysctl+8"><code>sysctl(8)</code> tool</a> is a simple wrapper over the contents of <code>/proc/sys/</code>, but on NetBSD it’s a direct client to the kernel’s <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sysctl+3"><code>sysctl(3)</code> API</a>. For a sneak peek of what these kernel settings involve, type <code>sysctl -a</code> to get a list of all available knobs and their current values.</p>

<p>Because <code>sysctl</code> offers access to tuning kernel-level knobs for the whole system, it seems natural to have a mechanism to configure those at system boot time. After all, if you want to modify how e.g. the virtual memory subsystem works, you will want do that during the early stages of the system’s boot process.</p>

<p>Looking at a NetBSD system, here is what we have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">netbsd:/etc&gt; ls -l sysctl*
-rw-r--r--  <span>1</span> root  wheel  <span>797</span> Oct <span>12</span>  <span>2018</span> sysctl.conf
netbsd:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In this scenario, all kernel settings must be put in the single <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> text file, which is then trivially read at boot time by the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/etc/rc.d/sysctl?rev=1.13&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&amp;only_with_tag=MAIN"><code>/etc/rc.d/sysctl</code> script</a>. Both human administrators and automated processes have to update this single file if they want to effect change on <code>sysctl</code> settings at boot time.</p>

<p>Let’s compare this to a what Debian system has:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">debian:/etc&gt; ls -l sysctl*
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>2351</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> sysctl.conf

sysctl.d:
total 4K
lrwxrwxrwx <span>1</span> root root  <span>14</span> Apr <span>27</span> <span>13</span>:02 <span>99</span>-sysctl.conf -&gt; ../sysctl.conf
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>639</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> README.sysctl
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>324</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> protect-links.conf
debian:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>We still have the traditional <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file but we <em>also</em> have an <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> subdirectory. In this case, the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-sysctl.service.html"><code>systemd-sysctl</code> boot service</a>—because it <em>had</em> to be systemd, of course—iterates over all files under <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> <em>in lexicographical order</em> and applies their settings.</p>

<p>Note that I did <em>not</em> mention <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and that’s because <code>systemd-sysctl</code> couldn’t care less about it. That file location exists for the administrator’s convenience as the traditional place to perform manual edits. But the way <code>systemd-sysctl</code> finds this file is thanks to its <code>/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf</code> symlink. The <code>99</code> prefix is important, as this causes the administrator-controlled file to sort after all others. In this way, its contents override any other settings that might have been put under the <code>sysctl.d</code> directory by automated tools.</p>

<p>But that’s not the only way configuration directories interact with their corresponding legacy file.</p>



<p>In our previous example, we saw that the <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file on a Debian system exists purely for the convenience of the administrator. The system does not care about this file directly so its existence in this specific location might as well be removed.</p>

<p>The alternative is to go the complete opposite route: keep the configuration file as the primary location for the configuration, but then make this file explicitly include all contents of a subdirectory.</p>

<p>An obvious example of this behavior is the configuration for the dynamic linker: the <code>ldconfig</code> tool reads the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file to discover which directories contain dynamic libraries, but is otherwise unaware of the existence of the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> directory. So how is the latter read then? Easy:</p>

<pre><code>debian:/etc&gt; cat ld.so.conf
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
debian:/etc&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> continues to be the primary file, but it then includes all individual files from the configuration directory. This requires native support in the tool to allow file inclusions and also makes the semantics of glob expansion tool-specific (are they in lexicographic order?).</p>

<p>Note that, in this case, the administrator has the freedom to append custom configuration directly to <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> or to create a new <em>unmanaged</em> file under <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> (say, <code>99-zzz.conf</code>).</p>



<p>Once you start looking, as we did in the first listing, you’ll notice that this pattern repeats everywhere: for any given configuration that <em>needs edits from multiple independent sources</em>, you will likely find a traditional configuration file accompanied by a configuration subdirectory.</p>

<p>So now that we have all necessary knowledge, we are ready to tackle the questions: What are configuration directories for? Why have these configuration directories proliferated? What benefit do they bring? And the answer to them all is the same: <strong>they make automated edits straightforward</strong>, which is important when you want a package manager to perform and <em>own</em> such edits.</p>

<p>You see: if you have a plain text file and you want to edit it programmatically, you have two options. You can have a parser that understands the format of the file and is able to modify it, but then preserving comments and formatting (both of which are important for configuration!) is difficult. Or you can add comment-like markers to the file and perform unstructured edits, but then those edits break if the user happens to modify the file in an unexpected manner.</p>

<p>Contrariwise, if you have a directory where you can put individual files in, and the whole configuration is determined to be the logical concatenation of all these files, all of a sudden automated edits become trivial. A package wanting to add new settings to the system will only need to add a new file in that directory, and the package manager will be able to track the provenance of that file. And if you uninstall the package, the package manager will be able to remove its configuration without issues (possibly leaving behind the files if they were manually modified).</p>



<p>So, are configuration directories better than files?</p>

<p>Well… they are <em>different</em>. With directories, we trade the ability to read and modify a single plain text file <em>by hand</em> with a scheme that is maybe-trickier to hand-tune but that is amenable to …</p></article></div></div></div>

    <h3>Impersonating web browsers with fake error pages</h3>
    <p>December 22, 2019</p>
    <p>If you’ve read my last post on <a href="https://zainamro.com/hacks/analytics-injection-phishing/">client-side injection</a> via an analytics javascript snippet, you probably already know that lately I’ve been thinking about simple methods of deception via unique and unexpected framing. After all, social engineering and other forms of deception usually begin by carefully staging a convincing scene. The perfect scene leaves the potential victim with very little doubt about its authenticity (or at least curious). It’s for this reason that attackers are constantly trying to come up with unique ideas for email phishing. If an attacker can impersonate a credible entity when the person least expects it, they can profit greatly.</p>

    <p>About 9 months ago, I came up with an idea — impersonating a web browser by posing as a fake “native” browser error page (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/1/">see example</a>). I created a simple prototype that looks at your user agent and displays the right error page for your browser. For demonstration purposes, only the top 3 desktop browsers are supported: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. While the idea is quite simple in practice, I believe it has some interesting qualities, namely that there is no obvious way to distinguish it from a real browser error page. With phishing emails, for example, there are often rudimentary methods which can expose an attacker like looking closely at the email address, domain, or language of the email itself. With a fake browser error page, there is nothing that is visibly obvious — the url address bar and the contents of the page are as you’d expect.</p>

    <p>Once you’ve established an anchor of authenticity via a browser error, you’ve now opened up the door to more interesting possibilities. One idea would be to show a popup upon leaving the page and ask for the person’s information as a means of browser error reporting in the same way that operating systems sometimes ask you to report an unexpected crash (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/2/">see example</a>). Using a prompt with the native browser GUI, this could potentially trick less sophisticated users. An even scarier and less obvious strategy would be to subtly notify the person that their browser is outdated and prompt them to download a newer version, thereby tricking them to install your malware (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/3/">see example</a>). Because browsers don’t show any indication of error in their native GUI when a website error occurs, this gives fake browser error pages the ability to speak on the behalf of the browser to some extent. I believe with the right audience, these types of attacks can be frighteningly effective.</p>

Automating deployment, scaling, and management of his containerized applications.</li></ol><h3 id="some-other-things-chuka-thinks-about-in-regards-to-lean-devops-and-selecting-new-tools-while-refining-his-strengths-are-">Some other things Chuka thinks about in regards to Lean DevOps and selecting new tools while refining his strengths are:</h3><ol><li><a href="https://helm.sh/"><strong>Helm</strong></a> — Dead simple package manager for Kubernetes.</li><li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/"><strong>Terraform</strong></a> — Safely and predictably create, change, and improve your infrastructure.</li><li><strong>CICD</strong> — “You don’t need the full CI/CD pipeline using the same provider (for example, CircleCI) if you have a VM that can run Skaffold which can create and package a Docker container,” says Chuka, “In 15 minutes you can be up and running.”</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/953638870888849408"><strong>GitOps</strong></a> — “With the new GitOps paradigm, engineers don’t need to know what the Ops are doing. You can have a single person Ops team.”</li></ol><p>We hope you learned something new that will increase your productivity in your daily dev workflows.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine the worst cafe rush-hour line you’ve ever had to wade through to get your latte. Now, instead of coffee, imagine that at the end of this hellish line was the data you needed about your products, pipeline, or customer behavior. Each time you need your data fix, you have to get up from your desk, walk down the hall, out of your house or office, and then wait in a queue behind hundreds of other people.</p><p>At the end of that line, instead of baristas, sit your data analysts, handing out the data that each individual person asks for. If anyone ends up needing more context, they have to get back in line and wait all over again.</p><p>If this sounds like a nightmare, that’s because it is. But it reflects a real constraint for many companies who haven’t democratized their data.</p><p>The future isn’t a data dictatorship—it’s self-service data democracy. One where, instead of waiting in line at a cafe for coffee, you can walk up to your own kitted-out setup in your office and get exactly what you need yourself.</p><p>Amplitude is the perfect example of this data-like-home-cafe approach to modern business. So I sat down with Justin Bauer, Amplitude executive vice president of product, to get some insight into how the company created a self-service data democracy that bridges the art and science of product development.</p><p><em>“Just like anything, [building a self-service data democracy is about] people, processes, and tools—in that order.” — Amplitude Executive Vice President of Product Justin Bauer</em></p><p>Sounds simple enough. But, below, we’ll take a closer look at what went into building the self-service data democracy that underpins one of the best data products around.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>1. Amplitude’s culture is built around a North Star.</strong></h2><p>A<a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2018/03/21/product-north-star-metric"> North Star metric</a> is a single bar that everyone on every team at your company can use to measure whether or not your product is living up to the hype. It's the main support pillar that holds up your self-service data democracy.</p><p>The idea isn’t new, but it’s one that Amplitude has taken to heart and made their own.</p><p>For Bauer and the Amplitude team, their North Star is<a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2018/03/21/product-north-star-metric"> weekly learning users</a> (WLUs). A WLU is an active Amplitude user who shares a resource they created with at least two other people within a week. Basically, it measures both initial user engagement, and whether or not users find the product worth sharing.</p><p>“It really ended up being the perfect metric for us to really reflect on what we were working on,” Bauer said.</p><p>But setting their sights on this guiding light wasn’t enough to align with it. Amplitude needed to create a culture and a system of habits that chased WLUs at every level of the company. To do this, Bauer and his team did three things:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Put into words the most basic promise of their product</strong> to understand what all other work should be in service to.</li><li><strong>Identified what <em>one </em>metric most signifies whether or not their product is useful to users.</strong> The performance of this metric was a binary tell of whether or not they’re following through on their promise to customers.</li><li><strong>Created a constellation of metrics that surrounded their North Star</strong> to build out the net of a self-service data democracy and give each team a way to make progress toward their North Star.</li></ol><p>Anyone who has heard of Amplitude knows that their main promise is to make it easier to build good products through data and collaboration. This mission clearly pointed in the direction of the company’s North Star, but the Amplitude team needed to come up with a constellation of metrics that would align work at every level with this guiding goal.</p><p>These supporting metrics were in direct service to boosting WLUs and gave each contributor a way to measure their performance and impact, without the need for data analysts or engineers. No more waiting in a long line to find out how products and features were performing.</p><p>“We really think of it not just as necessarily a single metric but also a constellation of metrics that all help guide you towards your product strategy,” Bauer said.</p><p>By filling their proverbial skies with metrics that all supported the one common goal of driving up WLUs—and, therefore, improving how worthwhile users found the platform—they built a culture that was wholly aligned with their main promise.</p><p>As a result, each team’s daily work furthers their progress toward their North Star metric and fits the transparent data-driven product strategy that supports it.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>2. They make sure everyone understands the data.</strong></h2><p>It’s all well and good if your employees have access to the data they—and others—produce, but they can’t make strong business decisions if they don’t understand what that data means. Without informed citizens, your self-service data democracy will shrivel up.</p><p>Back before the days of companies like Amplitude, the only people who understood data were the ones who created it, mainly the aforementioned engineers and data analysts. This created our nightmarish cafe scenario from the beginning.</p><p>Thankfully, Bauer and his team, like many industry leaders, took the secondhand gold of why data dictatorships suck and did the opposite. They intentionally and consistently educated their teams to ensure that they knew where to go for data, how to read its insights, and how to integrate those insights into practice.</p><p>The way that Amplitude began to foster this understanding is the same process for how they maintain the knowledge today:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Give each team and contributor a micro metric</strong> <strong>to focus on</strong> that lines up with daily work and supports the overall North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Educate team members on the tools</strong> available to them to pull and read data insights.</li><li><strong>Encourage team members to look closely at data</strong> to answer everyday tasks and experiment with new ideas.</li><li><strong>Anchor all product decisions to data</strong>, and clearly communicate how the work of each team affects higher-level goals.</li></ul><p>By making sure everyone from sales to engineering understands the data they’re creating—and knows how to create high-quality data through data governance (as we’ll discuss below)—Bauer and the Amplitude team empowered their democratic citizens to make the best decisions possible.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>3. Amplitude empowers engineers to use data themselves.</strong></h2><p>The truth is, while engineers are an integral part of building a great product, they’re traditionally seen as the last part of the implementation waterfall. This cuts off at the knees the decision-making power and insights of developers, and it’s time that changed.</p><p>In a self-service data democracy, Bauer said, engineers need to be empowered to use data themselves. Doing so lets them see the direct impact of their work and helps them make better cases for features they think would make the product stronger.</p><p>“Engineers can actually even use metrics to try to fight for the areas they want to invest behind,” Bauer said. “It's a great way to actually democratize who's even making product decisions.”</p><p>So, to make both engineers better and the product stronger, Amplitude handed engineers the key to their data democracy. This not only made their engineers happier but also helped them be more engaged in the work they were doing, Bauer said.</p><p><em>“Now they are highly incentivized to actually do the instrumentation because they want to see if the work they're doing is actually helping improve those metrics and helping the business grow.”</em></p><p>But this wasn’t simply a matter of granting engineers access to data tools. The process, like that of educating the company as a whole about data, had to be done intentionally through the following steps:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Bring engineers into the strategy and goal setting</strong> early on so everyone is on the same page.</li><li><strong>Educate engineers on how Amplitude measured success</strong> so they can measure their work in relation to the North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Develop a</strong><a href="https://www.avo.app/blog/our-definitive-guide-to-tracking-plans"><strong> well-thought-out tracking plan</strong></a> to ensure analytics implementation is done consistently from the beginning.</li><li><strong>Empower engineers to use data tools</strong> to see how their product decisions affect performance and experiment with new features.</li></ul><p>When Amplitude’s engineers were given a seat at the table and empowered to make the case for new features and improvements through data, the whole organization was able better fulfill its promise to customers.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>4. They focus on creating great governance.</strong></h2><p>Good governance is at the heart of all successful democracies and ensures that people have access to high-quality data and that processes are in place to continue this in the future.</p><p>“Leading companies are starting to realize that, in a world of data democracy, governance is important,” Bauer said. “If you invest behind that, then you get the dividends of self-service data democracy ... [But] it actually takes a lot of work to govern data well, to ensure that the people have the right levels of access and what they’re accessing is high quality.”</p><p>Rather than restrict contributors and only give them access to the data directly related to their jobs via analysts, Amplitude created a detailed governance strategy that ensured the free flow of consistent, correct information.</p><p>But this didn’t happen overnight. Good data takes hard work and<a href="https://www.avo.app/blog/data-governance-maturity-model-how-mature-is-your-approach-to-data"> mature governance</a>.</p><p><em>“You can’t just get democracy for free.”</em></p><p>Amplitude “paid” for good governance by investing in and enforcing data best practices, standardization documents, and tracking plans. These efforts helped them create a clean, single source of data truth that evolves with the company as time goes on.</p><p>“There’s a lot more focus on data quality, and people are starting to really treat it the same way you might treat something like code quality,” Bauer said. “You actually have to have even higher data quality to ensure that people make the right decisions.”</p><p>To create governance to guide every team within the company, while granting access to data at every level, Amplitude worked through the following steps:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Audited the current state of tracking and governance</strong> to understand what was already in place.</li><li><strong>Created a map of their customer life cycle and the metrics that support it</strong> to ensure that their customer life cycle complemented their North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Assigned a point person</strong>…</li></ul></div></div>

I'm talking about <strong>researching analogous problems in other fields</strong> that have already been solved (or have failed to be solved) by companies in those markets.</p><p>In my experience, these analogies are hugely beneficial for two primary purposes: storytelling and solution design.</p><h2>Storytelling</h2><p>Analogies should always take a back seat to a clear, compelling, empathy-inducing problem statement, but as a product manager pitching or explaining the problem you're solving, analogies can be powerful frames of reference for others. This can be true in a wide variety of situations such as:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pitching your work to executives, investors, managers.</p></li><li><p>Getting buy-in from non-product groups who may be necessary to fully solve your problem statement or are impacted by the solution.</p></li><li><p>Building excitement in the product, engineering, design teams who will be working on this problem. </p></li></ul><h2>Solution Design</h2><p>Analogies have the potential to be either beneficial or detrimental to solution design. It’s important to make it clear to your product team that the analogy is not the solution but a jump-start for the solution design process. Without calling that out up front, analogies can stifle creativity and put the team in a copying mindset. When used correctly, analogies will provide the product team with a launching point for conversation and permission to think outside the box.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Today I will argue why <em>silent rules</em> are a useful feature of good build systems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Build systems <em>build stuff</em>, mainly by invoking other tools, like compilers, linkers, code generators and file system manipulation tools. Build tools were traditionally printing some indication of progress. Make displays the commands as they are executed. CMake displays a quasi progress bar, including the name of the compiled file and a counter. </p>

<p>Interestingly, it seems the more <em>vertically</em> oriented, the <em>less</em> output shows up by default. If you need to hand-craft a solution out of parts, like with make, debugging the parts is important to the program you are building. Compare the verbosity of a autotools build system with a <code>go build ./...</code> invocation, that can build many thousands of programs and libraries. The former prints walls of text, the latter prints, nothing, unless there's an error.</p>

<p>As an extreme case, this is taken from the build log of Firefox 79. This is the command used to compile a single file. Note that the command is not really verbatim, as the <code>&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;</code> parts hide long directory names used internally in the real log (this part is coming from the Debian build system). Also note that despite the length, this is a single line.</p>

<p>This particular build log is 299738 lines long. That's about 40MB of text output, for a <em>single build</em>.</p>

<p>Obvously, not all builds are alike. There is value in an overly verbose log, like this one, because when something fails the log may be all you get. It is useful to be able to repeat the exact steps taken to see the failure in order to fix it.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum you can look at incremental builds, performed locally while editing the source. There some things are notable:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The initial build is much like the one quoted above, except that the log file will not be looked at by hand. An IDE may parse it to pick up warnings or errors. Many developers don't use IDEs and just run the build and ignore the wall of text it produces, as long as it doesn't fail entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>As code is changed, the build system will re-compile the parts that became invalidated by the changes. This can be as little as one .c file or as many as all the .c files, that include a common header that was changed. Interestingly computing the number of files that need changes may take a while and it may be faster to fire start compiling even before the whole set is known. Having a precise progress bar may be detrimental to the performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The output of the compiler may be more important than the invocation of the compiler. After all, it's very easy to invoke the build system again. Reading a page-long argument list to <code>gcc</code> is less relevant than the printed error or warning.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is what I want to focus on. The whole idea is to <em>hide or simplify</em> some information, in order to present other kind of information <em>more prominently</em>. We <em>attenunate</em> the build command to <em>amplify</em> the compiler output.</p>

<p>Compare those two <code>make check</code> output logs from my toy library. I'm working on a few new manual pages and I have a rule which uses <code>man</code> to verify syntax. Note that I specifically used markup that wraps long lines, as this is also something you'd see in a terminal window.</p>

<p>This is what you get out of the box:</p>

<p>Advancement in computer vision technology can not only empower self-driving cars but also assist developers in building unbiased facial recognition solutions. However, the dearth of 3D images is impeding the development of computer vision technology. Today, most of the existing image data are in 2D, but 3D data are equally essential for researchers as well as developers to understand the real-world effectively. 3D images of varied objects can allow them to create superior computer vision solutions that can revolutionize the way we live. But, gathering 3D images is not as straightforward as collecting 2D images. It is near impossible to manually collect 3D images of every object in the world. Consequently, to mitigate one of the longest standing predicaments around 3D images, researchers from the University of Oxford proposed a novel approach of creating 3D images from 2D raw single-view images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The effectiveness of the approach was recognized by one of the largest computer vision conferences —&nbsp;<a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</a>&nbsp;— as the&nbsp;<a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/node/817#best-paper-award" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best paper</a>&nbsp;of the year award.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us understand how researchers blazed a trail to accomplish this strenuous task of generating 3D images using single-view 2D images.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Creating 3D Images&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The researchers of the Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford —&nbsp;Shangzhe&nbsp;Wu, Christian Rupprecht, and Andrea&nbsp;Vedaldi&nbsp;— introduced unsupervised learning of probably symmetric deformable 3D objects from images in the wild. The idea behind the technique is to create 3D images of symmetric objects from single-view 2D images without supervising the process. The method is based on an autoencoder — a machine learning technique to encode input images and then provide output by reconstructing it with decoders. In this work, an autoencoder factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint, and illumination. While the depth is to identify the information related to the distance of surfaces of objects from a viewpoint, albedo is the reflectivity of a surface. Along with depth and albedo, viewpoint and illumination are crucial for creating 3D images as well; the variation in light and shadow is obtained from the illumination with the changing angle/viewpoint of the observer. All the aforementioned concepts play an important role in image processing to obtain 3D images. These factors will be used to generate 3D images by further processing and clubbing it back together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To create 3D images with depth, albedo, viewpoint, and illumination, the researchers leveraged the fact that numerous objects in the world have a symmetric structure. Therefore, the research was mostly limited to symmetric objects such as human faces, cat faces, and cars from single-view images.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Challenges&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Motivated to understand images more naturally for 3D image modelling, the researchers worked under two challenging conditions. Firstly, they ensured that no 2D or 3D ground truth information such as key points, segmentation, depth maps, or prior knowledge of a 3D model was utilized while training the model. Being unaware of every detail of images while generating 3D images is essential as this would eliminate the bottleneck of gathering image annotations for computer vision solutions. Secondly, the researchers had to create 3D images using only single-view images. In other words, it eliminates the need to collect multiple views of the same object. Considering these two problems was vital for the researchers because it would expedite working with fewer images while making computer vision-based applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Approach&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this work, the internal decomposition of images into albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination was carried out without supervision. Following this, the researchers used symmetry as a geometric cue to construct 3D images with the generated four factors of input images. Although objects might never be completely symmetric, neither in shape nor appearance, the researchers compensated for their consideration later in their work. For instance, one cannot always take the left part of a face to construct the other half of the face considering symmetry, as hairstyle or expression of humans may vary. Similarly, albedo can be non-symmetric since the texture of a cat’s both sides of the face may differ. And to make the matter worse, even if both shape and albedo are symmetric, the appearance may still be different due to illumination. To mitigate these challenges, the researchers devised two approaches. They explicitly modelled illumination to recover the shape of the input objects’ images. In addition, they augmented the model to reason the absence of symmetry in objects while generating 3D images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining the two methods, the researchers built an end-to-end learning formulation that delivered exceptional results compared to previous research that used an unsupervised approach for morphing 3D images. Besides, the researchers were able to outperform a recent state-of-the-art<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">method</a>&nbsp;that leveraged supervision for creating 3D images from 2D images.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Techniques Of Creating 3D Images from 2D Images</h3>



<p>The four factors — albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination — that are decomposed from the input images are supposed to regenerate the image on their combination. But, due to the asymmetric nature of objects, even for the faces of humans and cats, clubbing the albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination, might not be able to replicate the input image in 3D. To compensate<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for their earlier consideration of symmetricity of objects, even though objects were not really symmetric, the researchers devised two measures. According to researchers, asymmetries arise from shape deformation, asymmetric albedo, and illumination. Therefore, they explicitly&nbsp;modelled&nbsp;asymmetric illumination. They then ensured that the model estimates a confidence score for each pixel in the input image that explains the probability of the pixel having a symmetric counterpart in the image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technique can be explained broadly in two different steps as follows: –&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Photo-geometric autoencoder for image formation&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. How symmetries are modelled&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="419" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=640%2C419&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?w=722&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Creating 3D images from 2D images</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Photo-geometric&nbsp;autonecoder:&nbsp;</strong>After deforming the input images into albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination, the reconstruction takes place in two steps: lighting and reprojection. While the lightning function creates<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a version of the object based on the depth map, light direction, albedo, as seen from a canonical viewpoint, the reprojection function simulates the effect of a viewpoint change and generates images given the canonical depth and shaded canonical image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Probably symmetric objects:&nbsp;</strong>Creating 3D image from 2D images requires determining the object points in images that are symmetric. By combining depth and albedo, the researchers were able to get a canonical frame.&nbsp;But,&nbsp;this process was also carried out by flipping the depth and albedo along a horizontal axis. This was embraced to get another image that was reconstructed with the flipped depth and albedo. Following this, they used the reconstruction losses of both the images that were leveraged for reasoning the symmetry probabilistically while generating the 3D images. The imperfections in created images caused blurry reconstruction. However, it was addressed by adding perceptual loss — a function to compare discrepancies among images.</p>



<h3>Benchmarking&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The model created by the researchers was put to the test on three human face datasets —&nbsp;CelebA, 3DFAW, and BFM. While&nbsp;CelebA&nbsp;consists of images of real human faces in the wild annotated with bounding boxes, the 3DFAW contains 23k images with 66 3D&nbsp;keypoint&nbsp;annotations, which was used for assessing the resulting 3D images. The BFM (Basel Face Model) is a synthetic face model considered for evaluating the quality of 3D reconstructions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers implemented the protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of this paper</a>&nbsp;to obtain a dataset, sampling shapes, poses, textures, and illumination randomly. They also used SUN Database for background and saved ground truth depth maps to evaluate their generated 3D images.</p>



<p>“Since the scale of 3D reconstruction from projective cameras is inherently ambiguous, we discount it in the evaluation. Specifically, given the depth map predicted by our model in the canonical view, we wrap it to a depth map in the actual view using the predicted viewpoint and compare the latter to the ground-truth depth map using the scale-invariant depth error (SIDE),” noted the authors in the preprint paper.</p>



<p>Besides, the researchers reported the mean angle deviation (MAD), which can estimate how well the surface of generated images are captured.</p>



<p>This comparison is carried out by a function that evaluates the depth, albedo, viewpoint, lighting, and confidence maps using individual neural networks. While encoder-decoder networks generate the depth and albedo, viewpoint and lighting are regressed using simple encoder networks.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="229" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=640%2C229&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1 723w, https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=720%2C259&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>The above table compares the depth reconstruction quality achieved by leveraging photo-geometric autoencoders with other baselines: fully-supervised baseline, const. null depth, and average g.t depth (BFM dataset was used to create all the models). The unsupervised model outperforms the other models by a wider margin; a lower MAD means the deviation of generated and original images were bare minimal.</p>



<p>To understand how significant every step of the model construction was, the researchers evaluated the individual parts of the model by making several modifications.</p>



<p>Following approaches were tweaked:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Assessment by avoiding the albedo flip</p>



<p>2. Evaluation by ignoring the depth flip</p>



<p>3. Predicting shading map instead of computing it from depth and light direction</p>



<p>4. Avoiding the implementation of …</p></div></div></div>

                What's flying above us?
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm working to make it easy to find out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how:
            </p>

            
            <p>
                My <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1294002338215034880">Advisory Circular network of
                    twitter bots</a> post in real-time whenever they detect aircraft
                flying in circles over cities around the world, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, Portland, Minneapolis,
                and London. The bots often tweet about news and fire aircraft, and because they use an uncensored source
                of data they also tweet police, FBI, DHS, DEA, CBP, and military
                aircraft. They look for circles because it means an aircraft is <i>doing something</i> instead of
                <i>going somewhere</i>. If you've ever asked “what is that helicopter/plane?” there’s a good chance my
                bots can answer your question—even if it's an advanced military surveillance plane:

            <p>
                A few years ago I <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sowJrQQfgxnLCErb-CvUV8VGXdtca6SWYWWLRPZgaHI/edit?usp=sharing">discovered
                    a secret FBI aerial surveillance program</a>, involving more than 100 aircraft
                registered to front companies. I was one of the first people to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9508812">post online</a> about the program.
            </p>
            <p>From a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150605064602/http://fusion.net/story/143739/how-you-can-track-the-fbis-spy-planes/">Fusion
                    Media
                    article</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                This week, the Associated Press reported that the FBI is regularly flying “spy planes” over American
                cities.

                The report, which revealed the front companies the FBI uses to fly the planes, wasn’t a surprise to John
                Wiseman, a technologist in Los Angeles. Based on public records, he had already figured out some of the
                planes the FBI was flying and, using a
                device he programmed to intercept airplane transmissions, had identified over the last month the ones
                flying overhead in L.A. in real time.
                Wiseman wrote in a Hacker News comment in May about his findings, revealing a month ago what the AP
                reported today.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                I continue to help journalists with stories related to government aerial surveillance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1238149529469202433">Siri shortcut</a> that
                lets you ask what's overhead at any time, and it will tell you what
                the nearest aircraft is and who it's registered to. It uses the same uncensored data source as
                the Advisory Circular bots.
            </p>

                I've always funded this work myself, but now I'm in the situation of having been furloughed without pay
                since April.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve spent hundreds of hours in development work trying to bring the public this essential
                information for free. I'd like to continue this work, both supporting existing projects and implementing
                new ideas (I'd also like to replace my broken laptop).
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Oddly, I don't remember when or how I got my hands on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.toshiba-memory.com/products/toshiba-wireless-sd-cards-flashair-w-04/">Toshiba <em>FlashAir</em></a> card. These WiFi-enabled SD cards are made to transfer photos from a digital camera to a computer.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Imaginging that someone would use a 4MBps wireless connection to transfer photos when the hardware transfer is closer to 70MBps seems ridiculous.</p>
              <p>However, it could come in handy if you're in a situation where you don't have access to an SD card reader, or want to easily preview photos on a phone or tablet.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>Digging into the <em>FlashAir</em></h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>What's far more interesting about these Toshiba cards is the fact that they are essentially programmed to act as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">wireless access point (WAP)</a>. You can setup a custom SSID and password— connecting directly to the card over 2.4GHz.</p>
              <p>After peeking at the filesystem, I realized that the main photo gallery application hosted on the card is essentially a static website— served as basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>My excitement with this bit of tech was the possibility of building a totally discrete microserver that would be capable of hosting a few pages and services.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>My fourth-year undergraduate architecture studio, entitled <em>Dark Rooms</em>, was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://m-a-u-s-e-r.net/">Mona Mahall</a>. The studio was split into three exhibitions: <em>Pyramid, Server and Backstage</em>. These exhibitions were meant to explore the "spaces between visibility and invisibility".</p>
              <p>In the second exhibition, <em>Server</em>, we were asked to consider the design of an anti-human space— a dark, cold, electronic archive built exclusively for machines. In my preliminary research, I was particularly interested in artists like <a target="_target" href="https://arambartholl.com/dead-drops/">Adam Bartholl</a>.</p>
              <p>His project, a USB "<a target="_blank" href="http://deaddrops.com/">dead drop</a>", drew inspiration from an information-sharing tactic used by spies. A predetermined secret location— such as a hollowed-out rock, brick, log or other object— would be used to discreetly stash an important item.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Once the item— perhaps a slip of paper or a key— is "dropped", a second party could then retrieve it without interacting directly with the other person or being detected in the exchange.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Wireless Anonymous Repository</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>While a USB is already a much more "invisible" way of storing and exchanging information, I wanted to take this concept a step further. Using the <em>FlashAir</em> cards, I proposed a new wireless dead drop that could be just as affordable and simple as the USB, but with a myriad of superior qualities.</p>
              <p>Writing directly to the card requires an SD card slot; however, the wireless functionality can be powered without a desktop or laptop. A typical SD card takes 2.4-3.6V at about 30mA. I found that by using an SD-to-USB adapter, one could power the wireless module from a standard 5V USB outlet.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Depending on the location of the dead drop, this could be concealed within a false junction box that would be plugged in over the top of a standard 2-outlet 120V AC. If— in the spirit of the original USB dead drop— you wanted to embed the card in a brick wall, then the device could be powered from a USB powerbank.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>I named the project <em>warTOR</em> for "wireless anonymous repo" + <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a>. Though it's not connected to the Tor network in any way, I thought this title captured the spirit of anonymity (plus I wanted to use some Pokémon sprites). If someone would like to try it, the Toshiba cards <em>can</em> be setup as a wireless bridge... from a Tor gateway?</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>Something else that I'd like to try is powering the card via a small solar cell, but I haven't gotten there yet... The greatest benefit of the wireless dead drop is that one could log into the WAP from their cellphone, upload or download a file, and no one could discern that any sort of exchange was happening. However, I'm also working on a clientside chat application that could be hosted on the cards.</p>
              <p>With this implemented, then two people could sit down in a café and send messages back and forth over the private network; or, someone could login to the network and type out a message for the other person to see at a later date.</p>
            </div>

              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Here are some screenshots from the application 👆. I'll be doing a follow-up post with a GitHub link to the <em>FlashAir</em> CONFIG file that I'm using on my card. I'll also upload the source code for the original <em>warTOR</em> server with instructions on how you can deploy your own <em>warTOR</em> in the wild!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>
        <b>TLDR:</b> Create a super simple minimalist blog with little to no coding
        experience. Get <a href="https://bear.app/" target="_blank">Bear</a> (only available on
        Apple devices), export notes as HTML files, upload to GitHub, then link
        to host/domain. Profit!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I love things that are stripped down to the bare essentials, but still
        do their job well. I try to replicate this in both my personal and work
        life. Here’s why:
      </p>
      
      <p>Big chunky things = Scary</p>
      <p>Scary = Never gets done</p>
      <p>Small and super simple = Gets done</p>
      
      <p>
        To get stuff done, I break down and simplify tasks to a degree that some
        might consider excessive. This forcing function also helps me consider
        and address core issues versus symptoms. This post is about how I used
        this approach to quickly create a blog.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Having used Bear for years to keep a daily journal, I decided to start writing online. With Bear as the inspiration, I listed what I needed
        <b>now</b>, ignoring what I might one day use. The first approach leads to a simple but finished project, the momentum of a win, and the option for future
        improvements. The latter invites indecision, complexity, delays, and usually doesn’t get me very far.
      </p>
      
      <p>My ideal blog needed to be:</p>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Self hosted on a custom domain.</li>
        <li>Exceedingly easy to set up and update.</li>
        <li>Text based. Images were not an immediate priority.</li>
        <li>Styled for readability.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        By listing problems <b>before</b> looking for solutions, I can quickly
        filter results that don’t match. I’m then less likely to fall prey to
        premature optimisation, marketing or <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/" target="_blank">aesthetic usability bias</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Most solutions (including Wordpress) simply did too much. Paradox of
        choice was another issue. Having so many off-the-shelf options, each
        with a microcosm of near infinite themes and widgets, was just too overwhemling. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I took a step back and considered if my time would instead be better spent building a blog from scratch. A quick Google once again
        presented a paradox of choice; an endless number of ways or frameworks to choose from. I’m not a programmer and didn’t know where to start, so
        I took another step back. I drew up a simple plan, filled in some blanks, and decided to ask a friend about the rest.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I realised that Bear could export notes in HTML, including all the CSS styling at the bottom. This was a huge win as I could use Bear to create a simple home               
        page with a title, a paragraph, and an unordered list of links to individual posts. As for the posts themselves, I just needed to write them up in Bear 
        and export them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Enter <a href="https://kasun.io/" target="_blank">Kasun</a>, a friend, indie-hacker and
        freelance programmer (who’s currently working remotely while travelling
        across Sri Lanka). He was kind enough to teach me some basics about
        HTML, hosting, and linking domains. Here’s what we did:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Create and export notes from Bear.</li>
        <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account and paste the
          exported code into a project.
        </li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel’s</a> free tier for hosting
          and link to Github.
        </li>
        <li>Link domain to Vercel.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        That’s pretty much it really. For someone familiar with the basics, it
        would have taken under 15 mins to have a minimalist, well styled, and
        self-hosted blog, all without writing a single line of code.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the end, not only did I get my blog, but I also learned some basic
        web development! It’s a big win in my book and I wanted to share this
        post in case others (especially other Bear fans) want to do something
        similar.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="Postscript notes:">Postscript notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Considering the number of available options, it’s likely that I missed something that would have been a good fit. If so, feel free to tweet me a link.
        </li>
        <li>This blog is the first website I’ve built and has helped me realise that code isn’t as “scary” as I once thought 😊.
        </li>
        <li>Images aren’t included by default in Bear HTML exports. To include them, you have to manually upload the picture to your GitHub project and then include a link in the relevant HTML file as part of an image tag.
        </li>
        <li>Developer friends have mentioned that the formatting of the exported html file isn’t great. While not a huge problem for me, I will use it as a way to learn more about formatting best practices.
        </li>
        <li>Big thanks to the talented <a href="https://kasun.io/" target="_blank">Kasun</a> for
          the help! I can’t recommend him enough if you’re on the lookout for a
          freelance developer. If you’re a designer, be sure to check out

          to hear from you!

    <p>Over the past few years, Python has exploded in popularity for data science,
machine learning, deep learning and numerical computing. New frameworks
pushing forward the state of the art in these fields are appearing every
year. One unintended consequence of all this activity and creativity has been
fragmentation in the fundamental building blocks - multidimensional array
(tensor) and dataframe libraries - that underpin the whole Python data
ecosystem. For example, arrays are fragmented between Tensorflow, PyTorch,
NumPy, CuPy, MXNet, Xarray, Dask, and others. Dataframes are fragmented
between Pandas, PySpark, cuDF, Vaex, Modin, Dask, Ibis, Apache Arrow, and
more. This fragmentation comes with significant costs, from whole libraries
being reimplemented for a different array or dataframe library to end users
having to re-learn APIs and best practices when they move from one framework
to another.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/ecosystem_fragmentation.png" alt="Ecosystem growing up in silos"></p>
<p>Today, we are announcing the Consortium for Python Data API Standards, which
aims to tackle this fragmentation by developing API standards for arrays
(a.k.a. tensors) and dataframes. We aim to grow this Consortium into an
organization where cross-project and cross-ecosystem alignment on APIs, data
exchange mechanisms and other such topics happens. These topics require
coordination and communication to a much larger extent than they require
technical innovation. We aim to facilitate the former, while leaving the
innovating to current and future individual libraries.</p>
<p><em>Want to get started right away? Collect data on your own API usage with</em>
<em><a href="https://github.com/data-apis/python-record-api">python-record-api</a>.</em>
<em>And for array or dataframe maintainers: we want to</em>
<em>hear what you think – see the end of this post.</em></p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping-an-organization-and-involving-the-wider-community">Bootstrapping an organization and involving the wider community</h2>
<p>The goal is ambitious, and there are obvious hurdles, such as answering
questions like “what is the impact of a technical decision on each library?”.
There’s a significant amount of engineering and technical writing to do to
create overviews and data that can be used to answer such questions. This
requires dedicated time, and hence funding, in addition to bringing
maintainers of libraries together to provide input and assess those overviews
and data. These factors motivated the following approach to bootstrapping the
Consortium:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assemble a consortium of people from interested companies (who help fund
the required engineering and technical writing time) and key community
contributors.</li>
<li>Form a working group which meets weekly for an hour, sets the high-level
goals, requirements, and user stories, and makes initial decisions.</li>
<li>Several engineers with enough bandwidth will do the heavy lifting on
building the required tooling, and preparing the data and draft docs
needed by the working group. Iterate as needed based on feedback from the
working group.</li>
<li>Once drafts of an API standard have a concrete outline, request input from
a broader group of array and dataframe library maintainers.
<em><span>This is where we are today.</span></em></li>
<li>Once tooling or drafts of the API standards get mature enough for wider review,
release them as Request for Comments (RFC) and have a public review
process. Iterate again as needed.</li>
<li>Once there’s enough buy-in for the RFCs, and it’s clear projects are able
and willing to adopt the proposed APIs, publish a 1.0 version of the
standard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a gradual RFC process is a bit of an experiment. Community projects
like NumPy and Pandas aren’t used to this; however, it’s similar to successful
models in other communities (e.g. the Open Geospatial Consortium, or C++
standardization) and we think the breadth of projects involved and complexity
of the challenge makes this the most promising and likely to succeed approach.
The approach will certainly evolve over time though, based on experience and
feedback from the many stakeholders.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/API_standard_RFC_review_diagram.png" alt="API standard RFC development and community review"></p>
<p>There are other, synergistic activities happening in the ecosystem that are
relevant for this Consortium, that individual members are contributing to,
such as the work on
<a href="https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/master/other_meetings/2020-04-21-array-protocols_discussion_and_notes.md">developing NumPy array protocols</a>,
and the  <code>__dataframe__</code>
<a href="https://github.com/wesm/dataframe-protocol">data interchange protocol design</a>.
The section in the <code>__array_module__</code> NEP on <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0037-array-module.html#requesting-restricted-subsets-of-numpy-s-api">“restricted subsets of NumPy’s API”</a>
gives an outline for how the API standard we’re developing can be adopted.
The <code>__dataframe__</code> protocol attempts to solve a small, well-defined problem
that is a sub-problem of the one a full dataframe API standard would solve.</p>
<h2 id="an-api-standard---what-do-we-mean-by-that">An API standard - what do we mean by that?</h2>
<p>When we start talking about an “API standard” or a formal specification, it’s
important to start by explaining both why we need it and what “API standard”
means. “Standard” is a loaded word, and “standardization” is a process that,
when done right, can have a large impact but may also evoke past experiences
that weren’t always productive.</p>
<p>We can look at an API in multiple levels of detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which functions, classes, class methods and other objects are in it.</li>
<li>What is the signature of each object.</li>
<li>What are the semantics of each object.</li>
</ol>
<p>When talking about <em>compatibility</em> between libraries, e.g. “the Pandas, Dask
and Vaex <code>groupby</code> methods are compatible”, we imply that the respective
dataframe objects all have a <code>groupby</code> method with the same signature and the
same semantics, so they can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Currently, array and dataframe libraries all have similar APIs, but with
enough differences that using them interchangeably isn’t really possible.
Here is a concrete example for a relatively simple function, <code>mean</code>, for
arrays:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All libraries provide this functionality in a function called <code>mean</code>,
except (1) Tensorflow calls it <code>reduce_mean</code> and (2) PyData Sparse has a
<code>mean</code> method instead of a function (it does work with <code>np.mean</code> though via
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.classes.html#special-attributes-and-methods">array protocols</a>).</li>
<li>NumPy, Dask, CuPy, JAX and MXNet have compatible signatures (except the
<code>&lt;no_value&gt;</code> default for <code>keepdims</code>, which really means <code>False</code> but with
different behavior for array subclasses).</li>
<li>The semantics are harder to inspect, but will also have differences. For
example, MXNet documents: <em>This function differs from the original <code>numpy.mean</code>
in the following way(s): - only ndarray is accepted as valid input, python
iterables or scalar is not supported - default data type for integer input is
<code>float32</code></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An API standard will specify function presence with signature, and semantics, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)</code></li>
<li>Computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.</li>
<li>Meaning and detailed behavior of each keyword is explained.</li>
<li>Semantics, including for corner cases (e.g. <code>nan</code>, <code>inf</code>, empty arrays, and
more) are given by a reference test suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>The semantics of a function is a large topic, so the <em>scope</em> of what is
specified must be very clear. For example (this may be specified separately,
as it will be common between many functions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Only array input is in scope, functions may or may not accept lists, tuples
or other object.</li>
<li>Dtypes covered are <code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>float16</code>, <code>float32</code>, <code>float64</code>;
extended precision floating point and complex dtypes, datetime and custom
dtypes are out of scope.</li>
<li>Default dtype may be either <code>float32</code> or <code>float64</code>; this is a consistent
library-wide choice (rationale: for deep learning <code>float32</code> is the typical
default, for general numerical computing <code>float64</code> is the default).</li>
<li>Expected results when the input contains <code>nan</code> or <code>inf</code> is in scope,
behavior may vary slightly (e.g. warnings are produced) depending on
implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note: all the above is meant to sketch what an “API standard” means, the concrete signatures, semantics and scope may and likely will change</em>.</p>
<h2 id="approach-to-building-up-the-api-standards">Approach to building up the API standards</h2>
<p>The approach we’re taking includes a combination of design discussions,
requirements engineering and data-driven decision making.</p>
<h3 id="start-from-use-cases-and-requirements">Start from use cases and requirements</h3>
<p>Something that’s often missing when an API of a library grows organically
when many people add features and solve their own issues over a time span of
years is <em>requirements engineering</em>. Meaning: start with a well-defined scope
and use cases, derive requirements from those use cases, and then refer to
those use cases and requirements when making individual technical design
decisions. We aim to take such an approach, to end up with a consistent
design and with good, documented rationales for decisions.</p>
<p>We need to carefully define scope, including both goals and non-goals. For
example, while we aim to make array and dataframe libraries compatible so
consumers of those data structures will be able to support multiple of those
libraries, <em>runtime switching</em> without testing or any changes in the
consuming library is not a goal. A concrete example: we aim to make it
possible for scikit-learn to consume CuPy arrays and JAX and PyTorch tensors
from pure Python code (as a first goal; C/C++/Cython is a harder nut to crack),
but we expect that to require some amount of changes and possibly
special-casing in scikit-learn - because specifying every last implementation
detail scikit-learn may be relying on isn’t feasible.</p>
<h3 id="be-conservative-in-choices-made">Be conservative in choices made</h3>
<p>A standard only has value if it’s adhered to widely. So it has to be both
easy to adopt a standard and sensible/uncontroversial to do so.
This implies that we should only attempt to standardize functionality with which
there is already wide experience, and that all libraries either already have
in some form or can implement with a reasonable amount of effort. Therefore,
there …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Yubikeys are great for security, but their benefits decrease somewhat when you leave them in your computer unattended.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I unfortunately have a habit of forgetting my key when I walk away from the computer. I also have login passwords that are way too long and easy to typo.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s a way to solve both of these problems: use a Yubikey to unlock your computer when you put it in and lock your computer when you remove it!</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior art<a href="#prior-art" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The first example I remember seeing of this concept years ago was <a href="https://www.predator-usb.com/predator/en/index.php">Predator</a>, Windows software (with a delightfully retro website) that locks your computer when you remove a special USB drive. Similar examples for Linux include <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/pamusb">pamusb</a>, which allows you to login using Linux’s PAM by inserting a specially-formatted USB stick.</p>
<p>Of course, nowadays most people use Yubikeys to accomplish this, and Yubico has <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/Authentication_Using_Challenge-Response.html">convenient guides</a> on how to accomplish this very task. However, I wanted to make it <em>touchless</em> – that is, I wanted to be able to plug in my Yubikey and instantly unlock my laptop, without clicking through logins or touching the Yubikey button. Upon removal, I wanted to instantly lock my computer.</p>

<p>There are some guides on how to do this online (unlock when you plug in, lock when you remove), but unfortunately most of them fall prey to the problem described in <a href="https://medium.com/@d0znpp/how-to-sacrifice-security-using-a-public-yubikey-linux-guides-c823c4c6e2">this article</a>. A lot of them use udev to detect when the Yubikey is plugged in, but they don’t actually authenticate the key beyond checking its vendor ID, model ID, and sometimes serial number, which all can <a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/changing-creating-a-custom-serial-id-on-a-flash-drive-low-level-blocks.2099116/">easily be faked</a>.</p>
<p>To provide actual security, most official guides use either <code>pam_u2f</code> (which authenticates a Yubikey through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor">U2F protocol</a>) or <code>pam_yubico</code> (which uses either online validation through YubiCloud or offline validation through a challenge-response protocol). The U2F method requires a tap on the Yubikey, while the challenge-response process can be done without user interaction, so I went with the latter. I set up traditional Yubikey authentication using <a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/yubikey-login/">this great guide from System76</a>.</p>
<p>However, I still needed some way to test the challenge-response for success when I plugged in the key. Usually, <code>pam_yubico</code> is run when you login or unlock your computer (i.e. when pressing the enter key on the lockscreen). But I didn’t want <em>any</em> clicks, so I needed a way to run it without interaction.</p>
<p>Enter <code>udev</code> (again) and <code>pamtester</code>!</p>
<p>Here’s the udev rules I included:</p>
<pre><code>kevin@you:~ » cat /etc/udev/rules.d/yubikey.rules
ACTION=="remove", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh lock"
ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{ID_BUS}=="usb", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh unlock"
</code></pre><p>These rules effectively call a script when inserting and removing the key, so I can trigger any action from the script. Note that the script <strong>should not immediately unlock the computer</strong>, to avoid the security issues mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>To actually test the challenge-response from the Yubikey on inserting, I decided to use <a href="http://pamtester.sourceforge.net/">pamtester</a>, a simple utility that pretends to trigger a PAM authentication from the command line. Since <code>pam_yubico</code> is installed, this will naturally test the challenge-response if a Yubikey is plugged in.</p>
<p>Here’s the final script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>exec 1&gt; &gt;<span>(</span>logger -s -t <span>"</span><span>$(</span>basename <span>"</span>$0<span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
echo <span>"RUN"</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span>$1<span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"lock"</span> <span>]</span>; <span>then</span>
        pkill -USR1 swayidle
<span>else</span>
        <span># unlock</span>
        <span>if</span> echo <span>""</span> | pamtester login kevin authenticate; <span>then</span>
                <span># PAM login successful</span>
                <span># kill locker</span>
                kill -KILL <span>$(</span>pgrep swaylock<span>)</span>
                ps aux | grep swaylock
                <span># turn on displays</span>
                SWAYSOCK<span>=</span><span>$(</span>ls /run/user/1000/sway-ipc.*.sock<span>)</span> swaymsg <span>"output * dpms on"</span>
        <span>fi</span>
<span>fi</span>
exit <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>On lock, it immediately locks my desktop (by sending a SIGUSR1 to swayidle, the program that manages locking on the Sway window manager)</li>
<li>On unlock, it first sees if it can authenticate using pamtester without interaction (when no Yubikey is inserted or if the key is invalid, pamtester asks for a password). If it can, it kills the lockscreen and turns on all displays using Sway WM protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result is amazingly convenient, and has successfully made me remember to pull out my Yubikey when leaving my computer unattended more than once<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>! Mission success.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I’ve significantly downgraded this statement in severity after some excellent comments on Hacker News have pointed out that (1) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192390">stealing a Yubikey is incredibly unlikely unless you’re a person of interest</a>; (2) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192138">even if you have the Yubikey, you still can’t directly extract e.g. a private key</a>; and (3) a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190313">Yubikey protects against SSH/GPG fraud because it can require a PIN and lock out over time</a>. Case in point, Yubikeys are good. I’d argue that it’s still not good to have your key stolen (e.g. perhaps if you’re targeted by a government/<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24194081">industrial espionage</a>, or the malicious significant other attack, where they know your password and can steal your key for 2FA if unattended), but I see that it’s not as much of a risk as I originally thought. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>You might call it Yubikey: Coronavirus Edition. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Yes, yes, I know there’s not too much of a danger because we’re all stuck at home right now. But who knows – maybe this will be helpful when we <em>eventually</em> get back on campus. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

Most notably, the utility section consists of two new features — Model Encryption and Model Deployment.</p><h2 id="1dfe">Core ML Model Deployment</h2><p id="02a3">Until now, updating models in production apps has been a headache. Developers would have to either push new app updates or use on-device training, which is limited to a few neural network layer types only.</p><p id="b985">Luckily, Apple has introduced a new Deployment API that lets us update Core ML models on the fly, independent of app updates. To enable Model Deployment, we need to opt-in to Core ML model archiving (from the utility pane shown above) and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/evolving-your-apps-intelligence-with-core-ml-model-deployment-165579ba0546">perform a few steps in Apple’s model deployment dashboard.</a></p><p id="fc1f">There’s also a new class <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlmodelcollection?changes=latest_minor&amp;language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLModelCollection</a></code> that lets you access a group of models from Core ML Model Deployment. You can use this class for accessing a Core ML collection for a specific feature set in your app.</p><h2 id="7ef8">Core ML Model Encryption</h2><p id="872a">Previously, <code>.mlmodelc</code> Core ML model files embedded in our apps weren’t encrypted, meaning sensitive IP could fairly easily be extracted and exploited. To help address this issue, Apple has introduced an optional model encryption feature that lets you secure the model. It works in pretty much the same way as you’d sign applications (using your particular Apple Team ID).</p><p id="fe85">Now you can safely encrypt and bundle your model files, and Core ML will automatically decrypt and load them in your app’s memory.</p><p id="a6b8">The first time you load the model in-app, the decryption key is automatically fetched from the Apple server.</p><h2 id="bf93">A new async load function for Core ML models</h2><p id="6dd3">iOS 14 now brings a new asynchronous <code>load</code> function for initializing Core ML models. This is handy for loading models from <code>MLModelCollection</code> and for handling encrypted Core ML models.</p><pre><span id="d13e">MyStylizedModel.apply{<p>    switch result {</p><p>      case .success(let model):<br>        currentModel = model</p><p>            case .failure(let error):<br>        handleFailure(for: error)</p></span><span id="c4d6">  }<br>}</span></pre><p id="6c5a">Do note that the old <code>init()</code> function for loading Core ML models will be deprecated in the future.</p><p id="eb4f">Besides security and deployment, a bunch of new layer types have been introduced as well. <code>coremltools</code> now provides out-of-the-box support for converting trained TensorFlow and PyTorch models to Core ML while taking advantage of the CPU, GPU, or Neural Engine.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="5404">Create ML is a model-building framework that lets us train custom machine learning models on macOS with “no-code” by providing drag-and-drop and visual design tools.</p><p id="4776">It became an independent macOS app last year, and provides a variety of model types for training Image, Object, Sound, Text Classifiers, and Recommender Systems.</p><p id="fd1e">Apple announced a number of improvements to Create ML at WWDC2020. Support for <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video and image style transfer</a> model training was perhaps the biggest update this year. Coming from Apple, we can safely assume that it’s highly-optimized. Style transfer models would be extremely useful when used with ARKit to build immersive augmented reality experiences.</p><p id="6aee">Also, we now have support for training activity classification models that’ll find use cases in tracking body movements.</p><p id="ace8">Aside from new model training support, Create ML now offers more degrees of customization:</p><ul><li id="af79">You can now pause and resume training.</li><li id="e476">Create ML allows you to set checkpoints that you can leverage to build intermediate snapshot models at various stages of training. Using these snapshots, you can compare model results from various stages of training.</li></ul></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="ccfe">While Core ML is the most sought after machine learning framework by Apple today, it isn’t (and wasn’t) the only one available.</p><p id="4df6">Interestingly, there’s a low-level primitive framework <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a>, which is used to build neural networks to run on the CPU. At the same time, Apple also provides MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), designed to run on the GPU. Core ML is simply an abstraction built on top of these frameworks to run inference with an easier-to-use API.</p><p id="3ca7">Alongside the introduction of Core ML in iOS 11, a new MPS graph API (which is used underneath Core ML) was also released. The MPS graph API offered more precision during model training by letting us specify the exact layers and inputs.</p><p id="5142">Now, with iOS 14, we have another new machine learning framework: ML Compute. This one is specifically used for accelerating the training and validation of neural networks by using high-performance BNNs for the <code>Accelerate</code> framework on the CPU, and Metal Performance Shader for the GPU.</p><p id="13f1">It’s important to note that the ML Compute framework’s API isn’t used for building Core ML models and is only introduced for boosting low-level machine learning frameworks.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="5699">The Natural Language and Vision frameworks are built on top of Core ML. The Natural Language framework helps, broadly speaking, in the semantic meaning and understanding of texts.</p><p id="9217">Last year, the framework received a host of new features, such as sentiment analysis, word tagging and embedding, language identification, tokenization, and entity recognition.</p><p id="e452">iOS 14 now introduces sentence embedding. Building accurate on-device FAQs and chatbots would get a whole lot easier with this new technology.</p><p id="b0ee">Analyzing sentences through word embeddings had its own limitations. Simply put, taking the average of vectors of every word could easily lead to loss of the compositional information of the sentence. Also, word embeddings work with only a finite vocabulary set and cannot accurately process semantic meaning when the word in a sentence isn’t present in the lookup table.</p><p id="1cfb">The new Sentence Embedding API helps overcome these shortcomings by letting you analyze an entire sentence. You can encode a complete sentence’s information into a finite-dimensional vector, which can then be compared with other sentences in the vector space to determine similarities and differences.</p><p id="e980">The Natural Language framework is also closely linked with the Create ML framework. This year, Apple has introduced transfer learning for word tagging models by using dynamic embedding. You can specify model parameters in the following way:</p><pre><span id="13fd">let modelParameters = MLWordTagger.ModelParameters(algorithm: .transferLearning(.dynamicEmbedding, revision: 1))</span></pre><p id="d8cc">iOS 14 also provides a new <code>tagHypotheses</code> function that lets you find multiple possible tags for a given word or substring in the text. In doing so, you can now find the confidence threshold of each of the predicted tags.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="c4a4">Apple once again showed its computer vision ambitions during WWDC2020.

August 17, 2020 | https://nohq.co/blog/the-best-examples-of-employee-handbooks-for-remote/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nohq.co/blog/the-best-examples-of-employee-handbooks-for-remote/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Employee handbooks are a crucial part of human resources. They show new hires the information they need, can be the go-to place to store new policies in and when made public, are an excellent way to give people a glimpse into your culture. These are our top picks of public employee handbooks.</p>

<h2>GitLab's Collaborative All-Remote Handbook</h2>
<p>Obviously, we have to mention the incredible work that GitLab has been doing on making their <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">employee handbook</a> open and collaborative. With over <a href="https://nohq.co/sid-sijbrandij-people-dont-want-to-commute-they-ju/">3,000</a> pages and growing, it's the most extensive remote work handbook in the world. The investment into the handbook didn't only pay off in terms of transparency in the human resources department – it's also a marketing feat that promotes GitLab and its work ethic on millions of Google search terms related to remote working. The handbook alone nets the GitLab domain <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks">millions of backlinks</a>, impressive!</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_12.05.58.png" alt="GitLab Employee Handbook" width="800" height="398"></p>

<p>Marketing aside, the All-Remote Handbook by GitLab has become a remote work encyclopedia. Be it in interviews about GitLab or in any kind of coverage about the remote work movement, there's probably an article or quote in the handbook that can be used as a reference. As a prospective applicant or employee, it's calming to know that all information is stored somewhere in that big compendium.</p>
<p>Not only that, but GitLab's handbook runs on Git through GitLab. That means that any collaborator can take a page out of the handbook, edit it or add a section, open a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html">Merge Request</a> and get it approved. A big issue with handbooks is that they fall out of date often. If you give moderated access to your over 1,000 employees and keep the handbook as the primary record for information, it's much less likely for that to happen.</p>

<h2>Basecamp's straight-to-the-point handbook on GitHub</h2>
<p>Basecamp's strategy for their <a href="https://basecamp.com/handbook">employee handbook</a> is much more straight to the point. As part of their refreshed handbook experience, they have created a small slideshow that goes over 15 main chapters from their history to their travel guides and moonlighting policy.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_12.58.16.png" alt="Basecamp Employee Handbook" width="800" height="415"></p>

<p>Until a few months ago, this information has also lived primarily on a <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook">Git-powered medium through GitHub</a>. As you can see on the repository, Basecamp's handbook isn't quite as informative and extensive as GitLab's, which also leads to a lot less collaboration. That's fine though – pull requests on Basecamp's handbook usually reflect over-arching changes to a certain policy, such as changes to the profit-sharing program or a change in the requirements for a certain position.</p>
<p>Even if there is a little less content, it makes the utility of Basecamp's handbook no less. It captures the main policies and internal quirks of their culture without filling the handbook up with unnecessary clutter. Also: Basecamp's team is around 20x smaller than GitLab's, so it's no surprise that the handbook is a little lighter too.</p>

<h2>Clef's handbook for inclusion and value-driven culture</h2>
<p>Clef may not exist in its current form anymore, but their universally useful and available <a href="https://github.com/clef/handbook">handbook</a> has sparked interest either way. It reads like a blueprint for future value-driven and people-first companies and therefore is a great starting point for remote companies as well.</p>
<p>The handbook repository of Clef is fully packed with goodies. From their bias-aware compensation structure to and end-to-end onboarding example, it includes countless files that have lived through hundreds of iterations by over 30 contributors, amazing!</p>
<p>Today, almost 3,000 people have marked this repository with a Github star and as companies realize that being "value-driven" is more than just smart marketing, it's probably growing to grow a lot further.</p>
<p>Especially for small companies that may not have too much power to stand out from the crowd, a handbook like this can be your number one funnel to receive interesting and diverse applications.</p>

<h2>Glitch's interactive handbook</h2>
<p>Glitch has a long history and has built their own little nook on the internet since they started in 2000. It's very on-brand therefore that <a href="https://handbook.glitch.me/">their handbook</a> is built entirely on Glitch as well. With that, they are the only handbook in this list that does not rely on the Git protocol. Instead, changes are done through the Glitch editor directly. The handbook can be "remixed" in order to be used for your own company and just like we've seen before, there are multiple chapters that make up the handbook.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_14.27.02.png" alt="Glitch Employee Handbook" width="800" height="418"></p>
<p>Content-wise, the Glitch handbook is similar to the Basecamp one. Policies are strict and to the point and there is not much content to be read about the ins-and-outs of their working structure. That's not a bad thing. A new hire could get through the handbook on their first onboarding day or during a few off-hours throughout their first week.</p>

<h2>Creating a public handbook can help you</h2>
<p>We already mentioned it, but a public employee handbook can be a great window for prospective applicants to get an initial view of how you work. It's clearer what benefits applicants can expect and whether a company will suit them.</p>
<p>With the large pool of hiring companies and the small differences that divide them, making those things available publicly can make you stand out a lot. If you require a specialized expert team, that can be a life-saver, especially if you can't compete on the budgets of FAANG &amp; co.</p>
<p>A public handbook is also a lot of work. Things become inherently easier if the public handbook is the go-to source of your information. That means being more transparent than what you would have hoped for, but also comes with a wide range of amazing benefits, as discussed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Another week, another SciML release! Yes, this has been a crazy productive summer so thanks to everyone who has been involved. Let's dive in.</p> <h2 id="neuralpdejl_physics-informed_neural_networks_for_automated_pde_solving_and_high_dimensional_pdes"><a href="#neuralpdejl_physics-informed_neural_networks_for_automated_pde_solving_and_high_dimensional_pdes">NeuralPDE.jl: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Automated PDE Solving and High Dimensional PDEs</a></h2> <p>We have officially released <a href="https://neuralpde.sciml.ai/dev/">NeuralPDE.jl</a>. This is a domain-specific library for gathering all of the neural network based PDE solver methods. Its main focus are on the two big branches of scientific machine learning:</p> <ol> <li><p>Physics-informed neural networsk (PINNs)</p> </li><li><p>Forward-Backwards Stochastic Differential Equations for high dimensional PDEs</p> </li></ol> <p>On the PINN front, the library is all about <strong>automated solution of PDEs</strong> we want users who have no experience in partial differential equations to be able to slap down a symbolic description of the partial differential equation and get a reasonable result without having to know about details like discretization. To see this in action, let's look at solving the 2-dimensional Poisson equation with this library. We start by describing the PDE:</p> <pre><code><span>@parameters</span> x y θ
<span>@variables</span> u(..)
<span>@derivatives</span> Dxx''~x
<span>@derivatives</span> Dyy''~y


eq  = Dxx(u(x,y,θ)) + Dyy(u(x,y,θ)) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*x)*sin(<span>pi</span>*y)


bcs = [u(<span>0</span>,y,θ) ~ <span>0.f0</span>, u(<span>1</span>,y,θ) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*<span>1</span>)*sin(<span>pi</span>*y),
       u(x,<span>0</span>,θ) ~ <span>0.f0</span>, u(x,<span>1</span>,θ) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*x)*sin(<span>pi</span>*<span>1</span>)]

domains = [x ∈ IntervalDomain(<span>0.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>),
           y ∈ IntervalDomain(<span>0.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>)]</code></pre> <p>Here we described the PDE by its Julia code because, why not: it's as informative and refined as mathematical notation itself! Now let's tell the system to discretize and solve this PDE with a neural network:</p> <pre><code>dx = <span>0.1</span> 
discretization = PhysicsInformedNN(dx)


opt = Flux.ADAM(<span>0.02</span>)
dim = <span>2</span> 
chain = FastChain(FastDense(dim,<span>16</span>,Flux.σ),FastDense(<span>16</span>,<span>16</span>,Flux.σ),FastDense(<span>16</span>,<span>1</span>))

pde_system = PDESystem(eq,bcs,domains,[x,y],[u])
prob = discretize(pde_system,discretization)
alg = NNDE(chain,opt,autodiff=<span>false</span>)</code></pre> <p>and then we solve it:</p> <pre><code>phi,res  = solve(prob,alg,verbose=<span>true</span>, maxiters=<span>5000</span>)</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12683885/88482882-cbc00c80-cf6c-11ea-91bb-47a477f38af6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And boom, that's the solution to the PDE. We are continuing to improve this framework, and refactor some of the pieces so that it better connects to more ML and scientific computing library ecosystems, but it's achieving its general goal today so we've decided to release it. Major thanks to @KirillZubov for these developments.</p>
<p>Along with this symbolic form, there are FBSDE methods specifically written for parabolic equations and Kolmogorov backwards equations. This means that high dimensional PDEs that show up in finance, biology, and beyond can now quickly be solved with a neural network. Here's the code to solve a 100 dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for LQG optimal control:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> NeuralPDE
<span>using</span> Flux
<span>using</span> DifferentialEquations
<span>using</span> LinearAlgebra
d = <span>100</span> 
X0 = fill(<span>0.0f0</span>, d) 
tspan = (<span>0.0f0</span>, <span>1.0f0</span>)
λ = <span>1.0f0</span>

g(X) = log(<span>0.5f0</span> + <span>0.5f0</span> * sum(X.^<span>2</span>))
f(X,u,σᵀ∇u,p,t) = -λ * sum(σᵀ∇u.^<span>2</span>)
μ_f(X,p,t) = zero(X)  
σ_f(X,p,t) = <span>Diagonal</span>(sqrt(<span>2.0f0</span>) * ones(<span>Float32</span>, d)) 
prob = TerminalPDEProblem(g, f, μ_f, σ_f, X0, tspan)
hls = <span>10</span> + d 
opt = Flux.ADAM(<span>0.01</span>)  

u0 = Flux.Chain(Dense(d, hls, relu),
                Dense(hls, hls, relu),
                Dense(hls, <span>1</span>))

σᵀ∇u = Flux.Chain(Dense(d + <span>1</span>, hls, relu),
                  Dense(hls, hls, relu),
                  Dense(hls, hls, relu),
                  Dense(hls, d))
pdealg = NNPDENS(u0, σᵀ∇u, opt=opt)
<span>@time</span> ans = solve(prob, pdealg, verbose=<span>true</span>, maxiters=<span>100</span>, trajectories=<span>100</span>,
                            alg=EM(), dt=<span>1.2</span>, pabstol=<span>1f-2</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Boom: that's all there is to it. <a href="https://neuralpde.sciml.ai/dev/">Check out the documentation for more details</a>. There's still a lot of active development here so if you're a student who's interested in this topic, please get in touch.</p>
<h2 id="lie_group_integrators_magnus_rungekuttamunthe-kaas_and_crouchgrossman_methods"><a href="#lie_group_integrators_magnus_rungekuttamunthe-kaas_and_crouchgrossman_methods">Lie Group Integrators: Magnus, Runge–Kutta–Munthe-Kaas, and Crouch–Grossman Methods</a></h2>
<p>There are many differential equations which specifically fall under the form of <code>u' = A(t)u</code>, or <code>u' = A(u)u</code>. In these cases, you have geometric properties, like Lie groups, that you can exploit in the solution of the ODE. These Lie group methods are commonly embedded in domain-specific software, usually in robotics, so they are not generally seen except by practitioners of specific scientific areas trying to get the most robust and performant methods in these cases.</p>
<p>Well, SciML wants the most robust and performant methods, so we have now included these methods as part of the standard DifferentialEquations.jl suite thanks to Biswajit Ghosh (@Biswajitghosh98) and <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking (MLH)</a>. To use these methods, you have to define your ODE via a DiffEqOperator. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> update_func(A,u,p,t)
    A[<span>1</span>,<span>1</span>] = cos(t)
    A[<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>] = sin(t)
    A[<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>] = -sin(t)
    A[<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>] = cos(t)
<span>end</span>
A = DiffEqArrayOperator(ones(<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>),update_func=update_func)
prob = ODEProblem(A, ones(<span>2</span>), (<span>1.0</span>, <span>6.0</span>))
sol = solve(prob,MagnusGL6(),dt=<span>1</span>/<span>10</span>)</code></pre>
<p>that is a quick and easy way to utilize a 6th order Magnus integrator for the <code>u' = A(t)u</code> equation. We have high order methods and adaptive methods, and these all utilize as much mutation as possible to try and be efficient. There's still some optimization that can be done, but the methods are well-tested for correctness and ready to be used where you see fit!</p>
<h2 id="stochastic_delay_differential_equations_and_stochastic_differential-algebraic_equations"><a href="#stochastic_delay_differential_equations_and_stochastic_differential-algebraic_equations">Stochastic Delay Differential Equations and Stochastic Differential-Algebraic Equations</a></h2>
<p>It's finally here! A lot of people had found <a href="http://real.mtak.hu/106039/1/ENOC_StochasticDelayDIffEq.pdf">our ENOC 2020 paper on StochasticDelayDiffEq.jl</a>, but we had to spend some time getting the library to our continuous integration testing and documentation standard before releasing. Well, now it's finally here. StochasticDelayDiffEq.jl allows for solving stochastic differential equations with delayed components and includes higher order and adaptive integrators. It's built on StochasticDiffEq.jl so the methods that you know and love have been transferred to this new domain. It uses all of the development from DelayDiffEq.jl to give robust SDDE solving. SDDEs are very difficult equations to solve, but we try to make it as efficient as possible. Thanks to everyone who was involved, including Henrik Sykora (@HTSykora), for making this possible. For the reveal, here's an SDDE solved with a Milstein method with adaptive time stepping:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> hayes_modelf(du,u,h,p,t)
    τ,a,b,c,α,β,<span>γ</span> = p
    du .= a.*u .+ b .* h(p,t-τ) .+ c
<span>end</span>
<span>function</span> hayes_modelg(du,u,h,p,t)
    τ,a,b,c,α,β,<span>γ</span> = p
    du .= α.*u .+ <span>γ</span>
<span>end</span>
h(p,t) = (ones(<span>1</span>) .+ t);
tspan = (<span>0.</span>,<span>10.</span>)

pmul = [<span>1.0</span>,-<span>4.</span>,-<span>2.</span>,<span>10.</span>,-<span>1.3</span>,-<span>1.2</span>, <span>1.1</span>]
padd = [<span>1.0</span>,-<span>4.</span>,-<span>2.</span>,<span>10.</span>,-<span>0.0</span>,-<span>0.0</span>, <span>0.1</span>]

prob = SDDEProblem(hayes_modelf, hayes_modelg, [<span>1.</span>], h, tspan, pmul; constant_lags = (pmul[<span>1</span>],));
sol = solve(prob,RKMil())</code></pre>
<p>In this same vein, SDAEs are possible via singular mass matrices. These have proper testing and now have the official release along with documentation in the latest docs.</p>
<p>With these two announcements, note that because the SciML software composes, you can solve SDDAEs. And yes, these are compatible with neural networks and DiffEqFlux. Go have fun.</p>
<h2 id="automated_ensemble_parallelism_and_multiple_gpus_in_diffeqflux"><a href="#automated_ensemble_parallelism_and_multiple_gpus_in_diffeqflux">Automated Ensemble Parallelism and Multiple GPUs in DiffEqFlux</a></h2>
<p>You can now mix ensemble parallelism, and thus multi-GPU computation, with DiffEqFlux and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. An example of the multithreaded computation of an ensemble which is then trained is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> OrdinaryDiffEq, DiffEqSensitivity, Flux, Test
pa = [<span>1.0</span>]
u0 = [<span>3.0</span>]

<span>function</span> model2()
  prob = ODEProblem((u, p, t) -&gt; <span>1.01</span>u .* p, u0, (<span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>), pa)

  <span>function</span> prob_func(prob, i, repeat)
    remake(prob, u0 = <span>0.5</span> .+ i/<span>100</span> .* prob.u0)
  <span>end</span>

  ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob, prob_func = prob_func)
  sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Tsit5(), EnsembleThreads(), saveat = <span>0.1</span>, trajectories = <span>100</span>).u
<span>end</span>
loss() = sum(abs2,[sum(abs2,<span>1.0</span>.-u) <span>for</span> u <span>in</span> model2()])

pa = [<span>1.0</span>]
u0 = [<span>3.0</span>]
opt = ADAM(<span>0.1</span>)
println(<span>"Starting to train"</span>)
l1 = loss()
Flux.<span>@epochs</span> <span>10</span> Flux.train!(loss, params([pa,u0]), data, opt; cb = cb)
l2 = loss()
<span>@test</span> <span>10</span>l2 &lt; l1</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to Utkarsh (@utkarsh530), we now have fast parallelized implicit extrapolation in OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. You'll find these <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/ode_solve/#Parallelized-Implicit-Extrapolation-Methods">in the documentation</a> as <code>ImplicitEulerExtrapolation</code>, <code>ImplicitDeuflhardExtrapolation</code>, and <code>ImplicitHairerWannerExtrapolation</code>. For those ODE-inclined, these are pure Julia implementations of SEULEX and SODEX which include automated multithreaded parallelization of the <code>f</code> calls.</p>
<h2 id="new_surrogates_gradient-enhanced_kriging"><a href="#new_surrogates_gradient-enhanced_kriging">New surrogates: Gradient-Enhanced Kriging</a></h2>
<p>Surrogates.jl continues to march forward. If you have not seen the documentation recently, do <a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/latest">check it out</a> as it has undergone many major improvements, including showing differences between surrogates on many benchmark problems. One of the latest enhancements is Gradient-Enhanced Kriging, which is an extension to Kriging that can utilize derivative information (from automatic differentiation) to improve the convergence of the surrogate with less samples. Thank Ludovico Bessi (@ludoro) for driving this surrogate project.</p>

<p>The next directions are going to be highly tied to the directions that we are going with the latest Google Summer of Code, so here are a few things to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Higher efficiency low-storage Runge-Kutta methods with a demonstration of optimality in a large-scale climate model (!!!).</p>

</li><li><p>Continued improvements to parallel and sparse automatic differentiation.</p>

</li><li><p>More SDE solvers and adjoints</p>

</li><li><p>More performance</p>

</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>“He’s perhaps one of two dozen people who knows the name of Iron.”</p><cite>Kvothe, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2Y6Te0T" target="_blank">Name of the Wind</a>, The Kingkiller Chronicles</cite></blockquote>



<p>Names have power. Patrick Rothfuss adeptly harnesses this truth in his excellent novel series The Kingkiller Chronicles. In the word of Temerant, knowing the true name of an element such an Iron or Wind gives someone supernatural control of it.</p>



<p>The power of names is demonstrated through a simple photograph of place signs. Each of the words on the wall above conjures a feeling of excitement, or curiosity, or perhaps a distant memory, fleeting and poignant.</p>



<p>What we choose to call events, concepts and people measurably changes our view of them. The names we given ourselves quietly in our hearts have enormous influence over our mental state.</p>



<p>Astonishingly, recent research has discovered that we even <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000076.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look like our given names</a>. Researchers have shown that people and computers can infer our name by looking at our face, an effect demonstrable beyond socioeconomic cues. Therefore, our facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look.</p>



<h2>The importance of naming for clean code</h2>



<p>This a significant realisation for our mental health and well-being, but how does it fit with delivering clean code faster?</p>



<p>Names communicate. They have the power to tell others what a thing is and does. That reduces friction in our development teams, and allows us to understand code faster and deliver more quickly.</p>



<p>Why should we expend so much effort to get them right? Because the name of a concept gives us insight into how it fits into the system we are designing. Conversely, if we’re not careful with naming, we’ll be producing <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/write-only-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write-only code</a> which drifts apart from the whole, lost and destined for eventual deletion.</p>



<p>Here are some principles you can use to help you choose the best names and produce clean code with less effort. We’ll start with the nuts and bolt of naming code, then move to how to determine meaningful names in conjunction with our customers.</p>



<h2>Intentionally move through the four stages of naming</h2>



<blockquote><p><em>There are two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors.”</em></p><cite><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>How should we pay attention to names as we get started with coding something new? J.B. Rainsberger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks about</a>&nbsp;names of classes, methods and variables going through four stages towards clean code:</p>



<ul><li><em>Nonsense:</em>&nbsp;For example, we might extract a method from a larger one and quickly rename it&nbsp;<code>somethingWhatever()</code>&nbsp;to get the refactor done and the tests passing.</li><li><em>Accurate:</em>&nbsp;We rename the nonsense method to what it actually does, such as&nbsp;<code>processPayroll()</code>.</li><li><em>Precise:</em>&nbsp;Once we realise what the method really does, we might refine the accurate name and give it more precision, such as&nbsp;<code>loopThroughEmployeesAndPayThem()</code>.</li><li><em>Meaningful:</em>&nbsp;At this point, we’ve revealed the complexity of the method, and can look to split it up into two methods:&nbsp;<code>forEachEmployee()</code>&nbsp;and perhaps a&nbsp;<code>payWages()</code>&nbsp;method on a separate interface.</li></ul>



<h2>Don’t be afraid of nonsense or longer names</h2>



<p>We shouldn’t shy away from the early stages of naming. If we’re not sure what something is yet, give it a nonsense name. The name&nbsp;<code>foo()</code>&nbsp;is fine, as long as it’s only going to last fifteen minutes.</p>



<p>It doesn’t belong in a commit, and it’s not clean code, but it’s a start. It gets our code moving so we can begin to see how our concepts fit together.</p>



<p>As you progress, some concepts or ideas will outgrow your abstractions. They become ripe for future refactoring. If in doubt as to what or where something fits, use a long name: the longer and more precise the better. I will call a variable something like <code>computed_unsorted_project_task_matrix</code>&nbsp;if I don’t like it and want to refactor it at some point.</p>



<p>This is much more intention revealing than&nbsp;<code>result</code>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<code>res</code>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>r</code>). I reveal the complexity of the object through the name, which helps reveal complexity in the code.</p>



<h2>Characters are cheap</h2>



<p>Let’s not make things harder for the programmers who come after us. Remember, this is just as likely to be ourselves in a few months. Let’s avoid using a name like&nbsp;<code>p</code>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<code>project</code>&nbsp;is only a few characters more.</p>



<p>Anything that reduces reading friction in our code is a good thing.</p>



<p>This isn’t fashionable amongst developers in certain languages communities like Clojure or Haskell. They prefer brevity in variable names, relying on convention for understanding. For example, <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> often refer to <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> in a Clojure Map.</p>



<p>The important thing is to reduce friction in the team. If your team are used to these variables, it’ll be quick to understand: for them, it’ll be clean code. However, this will increase the barrier to other team members. In general I prefer longer more meaningful names to this. I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing the team’s understanding for the sake of a few characters. If names are becoming so cumbersome their length is reducing clarity, this shows the need for a refactor.</p>



<h2>Name concepts for your customer, not yourself</h2>



<p>Along the steps we take through to making names more precise and meaningful, how do we choose what words to use for the concepts we’re dealing with? We name these concepts through continual conversations with customers.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous language is an excellent concept and tool that Eric Evans introduced years ago in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3ftKZBF">Domain Driven Design</a>. Every coder would do well to read at least the first half of this book. The idea is often taught within a Behaviour Driven Development context, but it is logically independent. Any agile team can work towards a Ubiquitous Language.</p>



<p>The central idea is that there are two languages that we can use to talk about a concept: the “problem” language or the “solution” language. The problem language is the language of the customer. For example, a payroll system might use concepts like <em>wages, salary, PAYE, tax, paying.</em> The solution language is the language of developmers. For example we might use the following names for the code that runs the payroll system: <em>button, element, value, collection, style, parent-child, container, object.</em></p>



<p>The solution language is where many programmers naturally live, think and speak. It’s easy for us to operate with these kinds of concepts. The trouble is, they’re often alien for our customer. Instead of lazily reaching for <code>parent</code>–<code>child</code> (or the more problematic <code>master</code>–<code>slave</code> vernacular) when describing a concept, let’s instead collaborate with our customers on a shared language that works well for everyone. Perhaps we <em>add an employee to a tax band</em> rather than <em>insert a user into a collection</em>, both <a href="https://deliverydoubled.com/deliver-faster-boost-teamwork-a-simple-guide-to-development-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when discussing the next feature</a>, and when we’re writing the code itself.</p>



<h2>Intentional conversations reduce confusion and produce clean code</h2>



<p>It’s common for teams to have to deal with concepts and words that overlap and interact with each other. Single concepts are called different things by different people on the team. Different groups of people within an organisation use the same word for wholly different ideas.</p>



<p>It’s such a universal problem people often don’t pay attention to it. However confusion and cognitive load will build up and cause communication problems over time.</p>



<p>It’s also fairly easy to solve this problem through having quick, regular, intentional conversations.</p>



<p>Next time you’re discussing a concept with your team that’s poorly named, speak up. Ask whether there’s another name for the concept that could reduce confusion. Try a few different words or phrases out with the team until you settle on the right thing. This might mean inventing entirely new words or concepts that fit well with everyone in the team. That’s ok, as long as it makes our language more precise.</p>



<p>Once a word has been decided on, commit to using it everywhere from now on. Deliberately take the time to update the names in the code to match.</p>



<p>Perhaps you could volunteer to maintain a glossary of words so that everyone feels the benefit. Newer team members are often great people to keep an eye on these documents, and update them whenever they encounter errors.</p>



<p>There’s always going to be a barrier for incoming team members new to our code and our concepts. If we’re having these intentional conversations, we’re helping newer people by creating a smaller set of names for them to learn.</p>



<hr>



<p>Names have power. They can drive insight and influence communication. Let’s intentionally practice our naming as a team, so that everyone has a say about the language and terminology we use. Let’s build those names right into our codebases, moving through the stages towards the team’s language as the code becomes clearer. This will harmonise the team’s work, make for cleaner code, and puts the team on the right track to improving their delivery times.</p>

<p>Be honest with yourself: after your last standup ended, if you were asked to repeat back what each person did in the last 24 hours and was planning to do in the next 24 hours, how would you do? I think most people would be lucky to get a 25% on that test.</p>



<p>Standup meetings are supposed to be for the team to move the sprint forward, but they’re often just a status update for the PM or Scrum Master, because everyone else recites their status and then zones out the rest of the time. </p>



<p>If that sounds painfully familiar, then I have a suggestion. Walk the board. Instead of going person by person, go ticket by ticket. Make sure to start on the right side of the board, because the work that is closest to done should be the focus in order to limit work in progress. For each ticket, ask the current assignee what’s next, and if there are any blockers.</p>



<p>It’s that simple, but it works like magic for creating engaged, valuable standups. Here’s why:</p>



<ol><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>makes it impossible for people to just say their part and then zone out</em>, since each person has to talk multiple times because they’re involved in multiple tickets (one in progress, a couple in QA, one in code review, etc.). People are more likely to hear and understand what others are working on since they’re actually paying attention.</li><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>focuses the conversation on what will move the sprint forward</em>, which is the whole point of the daily standup. You only talk about what’s on the board. In a traditional standup, when people are saying what they worked on yesterday, they often start talking about stuff they did that isn’t related to the current sprint at all, like planning the next sprint, or going to a doctor’s appointment, or getting pulled into a different project for support. None of that stuff is relevant to the point of standup.</li><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>makes it impossible for tickets to linger in a status</em> for days or weeks. Traditional standups make that too easy, because a ticket doesn’t get brought up at all unless it got worked on yesterday or someone is already planning to work on it today. Walking the board makes it painfully obvious when a ticket isn’t moving.</li></ol>



<p>I also suggest rotating the facilitator regularly, perhaps weekly, to ensure that people aren’t just falling into to the habit of reporting to the leader instead of having a conversation.</p>



<p><em>But what about general announcements the team needs to hear?</em> After you walk the board, ask “any general things we need to discuss?” and let people speak up.</p>



<p><em>But what if the work I’m doing to move the sprint forward isn’t on the board? </em>Then either put it on the board or quit pretending that it’s moving the sprint forward.</p>

<div>
<p>In the last decade, Microsoft has introduced and subsequently scaled back a number of iterations of their Windows operating mobile phone with little success in the consumer market. Most recently they have announced the release of the Surface Duo, an Android-powered mobile device, as part of the Surface series. The phone is a hinged, foldable device with two distinct screens for the user to interface with – each 5.6 inches large. Microsoft primarily focuses on the value of the dual-screen as the ability to easily multitask and expand the field of vision within an application. Microsoft has long held that users multi-task differently when they can organize their workspace across two screens. As with all its previous models, Microsoft once again leans into the capacity of the phone to function as a productive space. The question is whether the Surface Duo and its foldable function will succeed where its predecessors have failed to provide Microsoft with meaningful reach into the consumer mobile market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two elements that primarily define our smartphone experience:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Function:</strong> Smartphones introduced <em>mobile</em> access to the internet and provided a portal for the browser-like experience on the mobile. This made the transition from the prior models of phones to the smartphone an easy leap – access to the internet enhanced connectivity, the core function of mobile phones.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Form:</strong> The form of smartphones followed the dictates of its functionality, that of a more compact portal for the browser-like experience. This meant while the screen had to be maximized (introducing touchscreens, removing bezels etc.), the phone remained compact enough to be portable.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Since the introduction of the smartphone, phone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung have been competing on improving the form and function to provide users with a better experience and capture market share. Form side developments have largely been limited to incremental changes like the removal of bezels for larger screen size or slimmer designs as a result of battery innovations. The Microsoft Surface Duo and Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold introduce a double, merge-able screen, perhaps the most dramatic shift of form (within one iteration) over the last decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a way to analyse this deviation in form, the foldable aspect, in a model comparing the motivation for consumers to adopt such a design and the convenience afforded to consumers by such a design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this context:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Motivation</strong> can be defined as the consumer’s drive to make a purchase decision based on a specific form/function feature of the mobile&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Convenience</strong> can be defined as the enhancement of the ubiquitous mobile experience, where the product taps into the already ingrained consumer habits in both function and form</li></ul>



<p>When design is motivation driven, it is better able to target smaller, more niche groups who desire a certain form or function feature. On the other hand, convenience driven design is able to effectively cater to the masses who share a mutual desire for a convenient, ubiquitous experience. Microsoft’s Surface Duo appears more motivation driven in design – the motivation here being productivity and functional two screen use. </p>



<p>The Surface Duo is a hinged, full rotation device that can be dual-screen or single screen use, depending on the user’s preference. The hurdle, however, is much like the flip phones of the past, the device needs to be “opened” in order to be accessed – with no front-facing screen for interfacing. Despite the trivial nature of an additional opening action, this step represents a greater inconvenience in the flow of the user’s experience. This is especially true when compared to the forms and functions of today, wherein the screen is immediately available and always accessible (e.g. simply lifting the phone towards yourself activates the screen). This is not to mention that the dual screens are in fact distinct screens, separated by a break line down the center – this caters more to a dual-screen experience rather than the single screen experience we are used to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, the latest Samsung foldable device – the Galaxy Z Fold 2 – maintains a single-screen experience. This applies both to its front-facing interface, as well as its fold out, seamless screen (no break line). Where the optimal form of current mobile devices is a maximised screen size that does not compromise compact portability, the Galaxy Z Fold 2’s smaller front screen and larger merged screens do not compromise the experience available in the current models. In fact, the fold out single screen enhances certain functions that might have comparatively been compromised when moving from larger devices to mobile, such as video playback or gaming. Ideally, Samsung has attempted to maintain the convenience of single screen models (the front-facing screen), with the fold out further enhancing certain functionalities.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo.jpg 680w, https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"><figcaption>The ‘form’ of the Surface Duo fold out screen experience – as a comparison to its contemporaries. Image not to scale.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So then why is Microsoft deviating from the ubiquitous form of current devices to distinct dual-screen experience? This is because Microsoft is driven by the theme of its Surface series, one that is focused on productivity and effective workspaces. Where Samsung has created an iteration of its mobile phone products, preserving the experience, simply with a larger screen, Microsoft has adapted its tablet model into a mobile phone. This is where a distinction forms in the ability of Samsung and Microsoft to service convenience, Microsoft aligning more heavily with motivation as mentioned earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In previous iterations of Microsoft’s mobile products, the point of differentiation was the Windows Mobile OS. Microsoft deployed its native operating system rather than leaning into the open source Android OS that was more accessible, familiar and convenient (Play Store) to mass consumers at the time. Surface Duo, while having switched to the Android OS, has been deliberately designed for productive functionality – dual screens being the derivative form. Here Microsoft deviates from what is the ubiquitous and most accessible form for a more general consumer base, likely leading the Surface Duo along a similar trajectory to its previous iterations – capturing a niche rather than converting the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the introduction of the foldable phone screen has had a rocky start with several models dismissed as being gimmicky or irrelevant to the mobile experience, it appears that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 may find a degree of adoption. It may not be too long before the fold-out larger screen format becomes the ubiquitous mobile experience. It then becomes likely that the ‘form’ of the larger screen could usher in an evolution of the ‘function’ of mobile phones – adapting to productivity/workspace use cases with greater ease. At that point, Microsoft’s productivity focused mobile might find success with a mass consumer base more easily.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Our addiction to our mobile phones dictates ‘form’</h3>



<p>“If you’ve ever misplaced your phone, you may have experienced a mild state of panic until it’s been found. About 73% of people claim to experience this unique flavor of anxiety, which makes sense when you consider that adults in the US spend an average of 2-4 hours per day tapping, typing, and swiping on their devices—that adds up to over 2,600 daily touches. …</p>



<p>…While there is nothing inherently addictive about smartphones themselves, the true drivers of our attachments to these devices are the hyper-social environments they provide. Thanks to the likes of Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and others, smartphones allow us to carry immense social environments in our pockets through every waking moment of our lives. “</p>



<p>Mobile phones are in a way, a method of chasing dopamine triggers if we look at what the most widely used applications are throughout the world, social media and their notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do social media apps take advantage of this dopamine-driven learning strategy? Similar to slot machines, many apps implement a reward pattern optimized to keep you engaged as much as possible.”</p>



<p>If we simplify the use of the mobile phone for the vast majority, we can simplify the function of the phone as dopamine triggers. The form then follows the function, a direct and accessible screen that is immediately available to us and a blinking light indicating awaiting notifications. In this sense, the Microsoft Surface Duo which leans into productivity for its design, neglects to address dopamine triggers as a core use case. To a user, the requirement to open the device which lacks a front-facing screen, is moments of delay to achieve a necessary task. Further, a foldable device isn’t as convenient as a flip phone, the action of a flip being far smoother a transition than having to put some level of care into the opening of the Surface Duo. Then, adding an inconvenience, whilst seconds long, would appear unbearable in comparison to alternatives available.</p>

<h3>2. Consumer behaviour in a world of limitless online and offline options</h3>



<p>A Think Google study assessed consumer behaviour and decisions in a world enabled by smartphones to better understand how consumers make choices both online and offline.</p>



<p>“By examining all of these needs, we learned how consumers choose – both online and offline – to navigate their I-want-to-know, I-want-to-go, I-want-to-do and I-want-to-buy moments.”</p>



<p>The study discovered three primary consumer behaviours across the spectrum of “I-want” needs and these results are strongly indicative of the holistic …</p></div></div></div>

			<p><a href="https://musically.com/2017/06/29/pandora-interim-ceo-primary-listening-experience-passive/">Naveen Chopra</a>, former interim CEO and CFO of Pandora as reported by MusicAlly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe that the primary listening experience is passive, for most people, meaning 90 percent of the time you just want to listen to music you like,” said Chopra. “It’s not about picking songs you like and building playlists.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://musically.com/2018/03/15/talking-points-spotify-investor-day/">Gustav Söderström</a>, Chief R&amp;D Officer of Spotify, also by MusicAlly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today we have over 200 petabytes of music data,” said Soderstrom. “We believe that with our larger user base and our higher user engagement, the distance to the competition is actually only increasing… Already today, we have more than five times the amount of music data that our nearest competitor does.”</p>
<p>He even compared music-streaming to the world of self-driving cars, where the more vehicles a company (like Google, or Uber) has out on the roads generating data, the better its chances of success in the long-term.</p>
<p>“We have by far the most cars on the road in terms of users, but importantly they’re also driving more hours a day than anyone else, so more miles. And we’re putting more cars on the road every day, because of our free tier… This is self-driving music!”</p></blockquote>
<p>For all the success that streaming services have been having in making algorithmic, editorial and algotorial recommendations, I personally believe that they are neglecting the development of tools better suited to more advanced users.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To use concrete <a href="https://streamingmachinery.com/2020/07/12/the-9000-song-long-playlist-there-must-be-a-better-way/">examples</a>, these tools could serve to allow the user to easily listen through the content of a book like “1001 Albums to Listen Before you Die”. Or to explore one or more lists of the best albums of any given year. Or<span>&nbsp; </span>offer some slightly more robust “queue” tools to plan for an upcoming party or car trip. Or a better way to collect, group and go thru all songs that are recommended to them on social networks and newsletters.</p>
<p>As I detailed in the previous link about “1001 Albums”, on a most basic level one tool could be a “bookmark” to let you know where you stopped on a playlist. Or tick marks to know which songs from it you have listened. But on a larger sense this tool is about embracing new concepts, like<span>&nbsp; </span>‘anthologies’<span>&nbsp; </span>and integrating them on the service in a practical way.</p>
<p>I sense an opportunity here. The number of “power users” who would value these kind of features maybe small, but 1% of a few hundred million people is still a few million people. They may even be more valuable than average users.</p>
<p>Platforms mature and so the users. Perhaps after a few years of using the app, perhaps an increasing number of average users will be increasingly ready to use such tools.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And then there are second order effects. Who knows how these tools will look like a few years down the R&amp;D road?<span>&nbsp; </span>What new use cases and possibilites will they allow? How much of the tools will trickle-down to new features that every grandma will depend on daily?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Finally, I suspect that the real number of active listeners are being severely undercounted. What if a majority of the very average users are in fact power users some part of the time?</p>
<p>Maybe the need for such tools of music exploration and organisation would arise only once a month or a year, but that would be a huge amount of use too.</p>
<p>Because the truth is that many people <a href="https://streamingmachinery.com/2020/06/23/the-sound-of-music/">care</a> a lot about music, even if they don’t admit so. How common are such habits as reading album reviews and popstar profiles, attending music shows, wearing band t-shirts, even watching two hour music documentaries?<span>&nbsp; </span>These are all ways of actively engaging with music. Heck, how many copies of “1001 Albums to Hear Before You Die” have been sold and read over the decades?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Maybe the demand for the tools is there, widespread but latent.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new study has found that 13% of people think of themselves as pathological liars, or say that others consider them to be pathological liars. Those 13% reported telling about 10 lies per day.</p><p>The study, published in the journal <a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#.XvDDrEQ2jzE%20">Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice</a>,&nbsp;included 623 people. The researchers recruited them in 2019 from various mental health forums, social media, and a university.</p><p>The participants spanned a range of ages, ethnicities, education levels, and income levels. The researchers asked them whether they thought of themselves as pathological liars, or if others thought of them that way. The respondents also took a lie frequency assessment and other questionnaires.</p><h2>Greater distress and impaired functioning</h2><p>The study found the pathological liars were more likely to experience distress and impaired functioning, especially in social relationships. This diminished functioning also applied to legal contexts, work, and finances. Their distress often had to do with worries about whether their lies would be be discovered.</p><p>The pathological liars in the group also reported telling lies for no specific reason, and said many of their lies grew out of an initial lie.</p><p>The majority of participants in the pathological liars group indicated that their problematic lying began during adolescence. People in this group were also more likely to say their lying was out of their control, indicating a kind of compulsiveness. Likewise, people in this group said they felt less anxious after lying.</p><h2>From <em>pseudologia phantastica</em> to pathological liars</h2><p>The phenomenon of the “pathological liar” was first recorded in 1891 by psychiatrist <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/pathologische-L%C3%BCge-psychisch-abnormen-Schwindler/dp/3226034618/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594994372&amp;refinements=p_27%3AAnton+Delbr%C3%BCck&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anton Delbr?ck</a>. He initially called it <em>pseudologia phantastica</em>, and used the term to describe people who told so many outrageous lies that their behavior could be considered pathological.</p><p>Since then, research into pathological lying has been surprisingly scant. One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05068.x">analysis</a> of prior case studies found <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_lying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pathological lying</a> equally represented among men and women, with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://psychnewsdaily.com/category/iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IQs</a> of the liars in the average to above average range.</p><h2>Formal recognition</h2><p>Pathological lying has not (yet) been classified as a diagnostic entity in either the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DSM-5</a> or the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ICD-10</a>, but the researchers behind the present study are hoping to change that. As they write, “we suggest that PL should be defined as a persistent, pervasive, and often compulsive pattern of excessive lying behavior that leads to clinically significant impairment of functioning in social, occupational, or other areas.”</p><p>Pathological lying also causes distress, they say, and poses a risk to the self or others; an example of this risk is if a pathological liar conceals the presence of suicidal thoughts.</p><p>Formal recognition of pathological lying as a disorder would bring many benefits, as researchers would then be better able to examine its features and causes. And effective treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and possibly pharmaceutical drugs, could then be more thoroughly investigated.</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> P<em>athological Lying: Theoretical and Empirical Support for a Diagnostic Entity</em><br><strong>Authors: </strong><a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#">Drew A.

<h2>The Guide to Social Media APIs</h2>



<p>Here is the scenario: you’ve been tasked with sending event-driven posts to various social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or even newer ones like Telegram, Discord, or Reddit. Developing the front-end functionality to share to these networks is easy, and there are a dozen packages/plugins for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-social-share-buttons-in-wordpress/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-share">React</a>, or <a href="http://js-socials.com/">Javascript</a>. However, if you need to dynamically share content from your back-end system, well, that means you need to register, be approved, and integrate with each social network.</p>



<p>Building <a href="https://www.ayrshare.com/">Ayrshare</a> wasn’t easy and we found it took a lot of leg-work to find details on the various social media network APIs, so we decided to share what we found. Here are the top networks, links to their API, guides, and process. The APIs can be called directly as RESTful services or search for a well-regarded wrapper for the API in the language of your choice. Most of the APIs use OAuth2 for authentication.</p>







<h2>Top 10 Social Media Network APIs</h2>



<h3>Facebook</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/video-api/overview">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>You need to register your app, and if for commercial purposes, register your business. This includes verifying your legal entity and address. A lot of the Facebook process and requirements are similar to releasing an app to the Apple store.</li><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/">Scope</a> permissions are extremely important and don’t be surprised if you get them wrong during the first few builds.</li><li>The API documentation is large and confusing at times, but if you spend the time learning it you’ll find the information you need.</li><li>We didn’t find any good packages that wrap the API calls, so we used direct RESTful calls.</li><li>You can get a permanent access token. However, it requires a few extra calls.</li><li>The Facebook approval process for scope permissions is the most rigorous of any network. You need to write up testing steps, submit a video, and detail your reasoning for needing the permissions. We were rejected once because our video missed a step in our instructions.</li></ul>



<h4>Other guides or packages</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable">https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable</a></li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-facebook-api/">https://pypi.org/project/python-facebook-api/</a></li></ul>







<hr>







<h3>Twitter</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Twitter requires registering your app as a new project (using their new Developer interface). Approval takes a few days, and although we were supposed to get an approval email we never did.</li><li>The API’s examples could be a bit more detailed. Fortunately the Twitter API is not complex. We found some great Twitter API wrappers, so we suggest using one of those. See packages below.</li><li>You can get a permanent access token. This greatly simplifies your token management.</li><li>The new Twitter developer site no longer allows localhost in their approved callback URLs, so you’ll need to use <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> or an equivalent tunnel to test locally.</li></ul>



<h4>Other guides or packages&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries</a></li><li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/getting-started">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/getting-started</a></li></ul>







<hr>







<h3>LinkedIn</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/guide/v2">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>







<h4>Other guides or packages&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-linkedin">https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-linkedin</a></li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-linkedin-v2/">https://pypi.org/project/python-linkedin-v2/</a></li></ul>







<hr>







<h3>Reddit</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes, only if for commercial use.</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Reddit’s API docs are auto-generated and a mess. The information is there, but it will take you a while to get a handle on them. We suggest checking out the subreddit on development (see other guides section).</li><li>Reddit requires you register your app to get the API keys and to complete a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api">Google form</a> for approval if your app is commercial. Don’t forget to do this.</li><li>Subreddit’s have different rules, so don’t blindly post to them or you/your user will be banned. To test your implementation post to the /test subreddit.</li><li>The other networks allow you to get long-lived or permanent access tokens. Reddit’s access token only lasts 1 hours. You can refresh the token even after expiration and some of the wrappers help manage this.</li><li>There are some really great looking wrapper packages. Go to the /redditdev subreddit and see the drop down for packages. However, we still preferred to go directly with the API calls.</li></ul>

<h3>Discord</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>You must register an app to get your client id and secret key, but the process is quick and easy.</li><li>You then need to register a Bot. Please see the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots">guide</a> for scope permissions and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#authorization-code-grant">authorization code</a>.</li><li>More to come…</li></ul>

<h3>Pinterest</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/overview/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes and new applications are slow to process.</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Pinterest has a new API and you must apply for access. If you don’t hear back after a week, write them a <a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/support/contact/">note</a> asking if you can provide more information.</li><li>More to come…</li></ul>



<h4>Other guides or packages&nbsp;</h4>

<hr>







<h3>Instagram</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes, but need to be in the Partner program (closed for new partners) to post via the API.</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Instagram has switched to the Facebook Open Graph API format, so if you’ve already built for FB you’ll be familiar with the format. You’ll need to manage scopes as you do for FB.</li><li>The API allows you to pull data, but you can not post via the API unless you’re a “Partner”. The partner program started in 2018 and isn’t open to new partners unless Instagram asks you to join.</li><li>If you want to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/sharing-to-feed">post to Instagram</a> you’ll need to have a mobile app that does the post, requiring a manual step from your users.</li></ul>

<ul><li>You must register your bot with <a href="https://t.me/botfather">BotFather</a> via Telegram. All the setup is via Telegram, such as setting your image, description, and registering.</li><li>We found the documentation and API endpoints the easiest to use of any network. It was our quickest integration.</li><li>Unlike other networks that offer an front-end user authorization workflow, such as Facebook, Telegram requires the user to authorize your bot in their group or channel. A few extra steps for the user, but with proper <a href="https://docs.ayrshare.com/web-interface/using-the-web-interface/telegram-integration">instructions</a>, very manageable.</li><li>Telegram offers a nice set of <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook">Webhooks</a> that update you whenever a new chat comes in.</li></ul>

<p>Spending on depreciating assets can wreck your finances.  Many people associate being wealthy with owning luxury cars, jewelry, designer jeans and high end watches.  This is the image of wealth portrayed in the media and popularized in movies. </p>



<p>The material goods you purchase are really depreciating assets and they are very bad for your financial health.  Every time you choose to make a purchase of a depreciating asset it comes at the opportunity cost of other assets that could be used to increase your net worth.  </p>



<p>Over time compounding interest kicks in to turn modest spending into massive opportunity loss.  This is how depreciating assets can wreck your finances.  </p>



<h2>What Are Depreciating Assets?</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/burningmoney.jpg?resize=332%2C497&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/burningmoney.jpg?resize=332%2C497&amp;ssl=1" alt="burning money" width="332" height="497" title="depreciating assets" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Depreciating Assets burn your wealth</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Depreciating assets are assets that drop in value over time.  Examples include cars, boats, motorcycles, computers. As soon as you buy a depreciating asset your net worth starts going down!</p>



<p>Assets can also appreciate or go up in value over time.  These types of assets are referred to as investments.  Investment work to increase your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> over time.</p>







<h2>What is the Opportunity Cost of Buying Depreciating Assets</h2>



<p>With every dollar you have comes the choice of what to do with it.  You can choose to invest it or to spend it.  If you choose to spend it, you exchange it for a good or service and it’s gone.  The <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a> of the consumption was the investment that you didn’t get to make.</p>



<p>You have to spend some money to get through life.  The problems arise when you spend much more than you need to for the good or service you want.  This extra money spent adds up and compounds over your lifetime reaching dramatically large amounts in the future.</p>



<h2>The Effect of Compounding Over Your Lifetime</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="408" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/growth.jpg?resize=640%2C408&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/growth.jpg?resize=640%2C408&amp;ssl=1" alt="Compounding Interest grows wealth over time if you invest rather than buy depreciating assets" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Compounding Interest Grows Wealth Over Time</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most powerful force in all of finance is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/why-einstein-considered-compound-interest-most-powerful-force-in-universe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">compounding interest</a>, or at least that is what Albert Einstein thought.  I agree with him, and you know they say that great minds think alike.  </p>



<p>So the reason Einstein was so fond of compounding interest is because it can turn small amounts of money into extremely large amounts of money over time.  This means that seemingly inconsequential decisions can have a HUGE impact on your finances over time.</p>



<h2>Examples of Opportunity Cost of Depreciating Assets</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="280" height="210" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/red-pill-blue-pill.jpg?resize=280%2C210&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/red-pill-blue-pill.jpg?resize=280%2C210&amp;ssl=1" alt="Opportunity cost means the choice to spend or invest" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Life is full of choices</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It can be difficult to really understand how much of an impact opportunity cost can have on your eventual nest egg.  It can be helpful to look at an example.  Let’s look at the impact of three choices to spend rather than invest on your long term net worth.</p>



<h3>The Choices Made to Spend</h3>



<ol><li>When you are 20 you decide that you need a new laptop.  Your dad offered you his old one for free, but you decided to buy a $3,000 Macbook Pro instead.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $3,000 at age 20</strong>.</li><li>Your finally graduate from college, and get your first real job.  You could buy a $30,000 Honda Accord, however you instead decide on a $50,000 BMW.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $20,000 at age 25.</strong></li><li>At 30 you decide to rack up $10,000 in credit card debt on designer clothes and handbags.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $10,000 at age 30.</strong></li></ol>



<h3>How Much Does All That Really Cost</h3>



<p>You might look at this and say it all costs $33,000, but this ignores the compounding interest had you invested it instead!  Let’s assume your alternative use for the money was to invest in a low cost index ETF that tracks the US stock market.  Historically you could <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expect a 10% return</a> over a long period of time when investing in stocks.   <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calculating it out</a> it looks more like:</p>

<p>So these three decisions to spend $33,000 that you made between 20 and 30 might have cost you over $1 million by the time you turn 61 years old. If you plan on working to closer to 70 these choices would have cost you over $2 million!  The <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/time-value-of-money/">time value of money</a> can really have a major impact.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>You must choose whether to invest or spend every dollar you make.  Do so wisely because the cost of your choices can compound over time to mind bogglingly large amounts of money.  </p>



<p>Learn to consider the opportunity cost of any item you want to buy today, not just it’s purchase price.  Think of all your spending decisions this way and you can learn to make better financial decisions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-c243a880=""><div data-v-c243a880=""><h2><strong>What is Flutter?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Flutter is a Google-developed framework that allows developers to share code between iOS and Android. It’s available through mobile app software development kits (SDKs) and completely open-source.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This allows developers to ensure consistent design and interactivity across operating systems, develop apps at greater speeds and share code from a single base, without having to create duplicate apps in two programming languages.</span></p>
<p><span>You can find out more about the advantages of Flutter and comparisons with other cross-platform frameworks </span><span><a href="https://netsells.co.uk/blog/is-flutter-the-future-of-cross-platform-app-development-in-2020">in our article on the future of Flutter Development in 2020</a>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Flutter for Desktop?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Having successfully created a middle ground for native Swift and Java languages, Google have focused their attention on extending functionality across multiple platforms. As of update 1.5, you are now able to build progressive web applications and desktop applications using Flutter, which can also be embedded in new smart home devices such as Google Home Hub.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up a huge range of devices to applications written using Flutter, meaning that organisations can swiftly build and deploy across an entire ecosystem using a single codebase.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This has drastic ramifications of speed of development and reducing the costs associated with delivering new features/platforms across mobile, web and embedded applications.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Can You Convert Existing Flutter Code to Desktop?</strong></h2>
<p><span>You are now able to use Flutter to create web content using W3 standard web technologies. This means that you absolutely do have the ability to compile existing Flutter applications into fully compliant web experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Preliminary support now also exists for developing standalone applications on Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS and Linux operating systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This allows you to take advantage of each respective platform's app store and build robust offline solutions for users, alongside still providing web access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This means that Flutter is an excellent solution for start-ups and scale-ups who are looking to reach a larger customer base through providing multi-platform support.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://netsells-site.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ba9ef762e968e581006a176d57c2d7fc.png" alt="Flutter Desktop Process Diagram" width="480" height="196">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Creating Smart Home Applications in Flutter</strong></h2>
<p><span>Alongside the new support for web and desktop, developers can also integrate Flutter applications with new smart home technologies such as Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Facebook Portal, giving you the ability to leverage new voice-assisted technologies ahead of the competition.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Can We Expect From Flutter in the Future?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Despite the major improvements Flutter 1.5 has provided, it isn’t going to be perfect from day one. Google Product Manager Kevin Moore detailed some of the <a href="https://medium.com/flutter/bringing-flutter-to-the-web-904de05f0df0" target="_blank">future plans for the platform in a&nbsp;2019 Medium post</a>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Support for plugins, location features, camera use and file access will be added to allow better user personalisation.</span></li>
<li><span>Support for text features such as copy and paste, allowing for better integration with existing web infrastructure.</span></li>
<li><span>Easier debugging, so apps can get to market quicker.</span></li>
<li><span>Improved performance, browser support and accessibility, boosting your user experience.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Does Flutter Mean for the Future of App Development?</strong></h2>
<p><span>With backing from internationally recognisable brands, such as eBay, Sonos and the New York times, as well as 1000s of SMEs, Flutter is quickly becoming the go-to choice of global businesses large and small.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With convenient and reliable cross-platform capabilities which are now even more powerful post the 1.5 update, the expansiveness of Flutter’s offering is growing exponentially. Google’s Flutter Development Team continues to add performance fixes in line with current infrastructure developments, meaning you are able to produce robust and valuable digital products across multiple platforms that will be supported for years to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether you’re a large organisation or an SME, creating applications in Flutter may get you top market quicker and reduce your development costs.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>In the late ’90s, when Sameer Maskey was a college student, artificial intelligence was an esoteric field. Yet Maskey, who “fell in love with computers” during his freshman year at Bates College, took an immediate interest in AI, particularly the idea of speech-to-speech translation. In 2000, after research stints at Carnegie Mellon and the California Institute of Technology, he built the first Nepali speech synthesizer and released it open source at a conference in Nepal.</p>



<p>Back then, “nobody took any interest,” says Maskey. “Not many people were talking about AI in Nepal.”</p>



<p>Today, Maskey is the founder and CEO of Fusemachines, a company that <a href="https://fusemachines.com/">creates AI tools and provides teams of engineers</a> to businesses in the US that want to build their own. Quiet and driven, he has converted his years of research and teaching — as a PhD from Columbia University, a speech-to-speech-translation research scientist at IBM Watson, and an assistant adjunct professor at Columbia —&nbsp;into the foundation for a 250-person company.</p>



<p>Fusemachines began with the aim of producing customer service products, like automated dialogue systems (the first of which Maskey developed after locking himself in a room and writing 20,000 lines of code). The New York City government was its first client. But as the shortage of AI engineers became a prominent issue in the US, where talent is swiftly snapped up by Silicon Valley giants, Fusemachines’ brand has shifted toward teaching AI in developing countries, where, as Maskey puts it, the company is “democratizing AI.”</p>



<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Why teach AI and machine learning? Why start in Nepal?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>In the past five years, the demand for AI engineers in the US has gone through the roof. They are being sought after by all the big tech companies, but there aren’t enough of them, which has created a huge gap in the market. Newspapers were talking about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html">how getting AI engineers was becoming a lot like sports hiring</a>. Companies in the US that aren’t at the scale of Google and Facebook <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-businesses-arent-rushing-into-ai-11560078000">can’t afford AI talent</a>. Colleges and universities are increasing their capacity, but they can’t keep up: the demand for engineers is in the hundreds of thousands.</p>



<p>After starting Fusemachines, I realized the market size is quite big, and that the technology would be useful for companies not just in the US. <em>We need engineers: where do I find them?</em> When I was in Nepal on one of my yearly trips, I thought, <em>Let’s see what happens when I teach students here.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a cost advantage to building a team in Nepal, of course. It gives us more runway with the same amount of money. But from an impact perspective, it was more interesting to train engineers from Nepal. A lot of the AI technology today gets built by large companies and is geared toward the US: if you put a self-driving Tesla on a road in Nepal, it’s not going to work that well. High-quality AI education in other countries means graduates will build tech adapted to their local issues and contexts.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>A lot of the AI technology gets built by large companies and is geared toward the US: if you put a self-driving Tesla on a road in Nepal, it’s not going to work that well.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4><strong>Is teaching AI abroad any different than teaching the subject in the U.S.?</strong></h4>



<p>At the beginning, I didn’t really have many expectations. But I started to see sparks of quality talent. I taught the same course as the one I taught at Columbia University. I soon realized my students in Nepal were equally good.</p>



<p>Going into it, I knew there would be some issues with rote learning, but not at the level I saw. Students have read about topics — from a syllabus perspective they have done all the math — but they don’t understand it well enough conceptually to do the coding. A lot of students weren’t ready to take the first course, so our only option was to come up with our own set of foundation courses and teach those beforehand. Our students in Rwanda and the Dominican Republic are similar. And other than the students from the top schools, it’s the same in India too.</p>



<h4><strong>How does the AI training industry compare in the U.S.?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The bootcamps are expensive — $24,000 or so for a typical course —&nbsp;but bootcamps have a lot of infrastructure costs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/15/new-yorks-programming-ed-tech-startup-general-assembly-sells-to-adecco-for-413-million/">so margins are narrower </a>than for a typical tech company. In traditional coding bootcamps, the students are not computer science students. They’re not making much money yet. In AI bootcamps, students are already software engineers; they already have good jobs. They don’t want to stop making money and enroll in a bootcamp. This might be another reason there aren’t as many AI bootcamps in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Do you think, then, that the talent shortage in the U.S. will continue?</strong></h4>



<p>There are a couple of things that might reduce it. There are the bootcamps, and also, AI tools <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/04/10/the-commoditization-of-ai-and-the-long-term-value-of-data/">are being commoditized</a> —&nbsp;you can build basic versions of a system. But if you want to make any improvement, then it’s a black box. Probably there will be some point in the future where the shortage will start to taper, but it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<h4><strong>Could online courses teaching AI — such as those offered by fast.ai or deeplearning.ai —&nbsp;help satisfy the demand?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Those are mostly taken by computer science students, but the problem with <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">purely online</a>, <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">self-paced courses</a> is that the completion rate is less than 10%. We have online classes now too, but they’re live classes, which makes a huge difference. Most students need more hand-holding, and there’s a lack of faculty. The foundation of AI, unlike programming in general, is all math. You can learn Python programming in six months, but you can’t learn all the foundations of math in the same amount of time. It just takes more time and more effort, from students and from teachers. There’s no shortcut.</p>



<p>We want to contribute to that by democratizing quality AI education, which will speed up the adoption and production of AI engineers. We are thinking of scaling up beyond our current reach by rolling out a program called Teach AI for the World. Like Teach for America, talented AI engineers would travel to different countries and teach for one or two years. We want to see thousands of teachers teaching thousands of AI programs around the world.</p>



<h4><strong>You mention </strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/04/16/heres-why-we-need-to-democratize-artificial-intelligence/#32cf4ee4f2c2"><strong>“democratizing AI”</strong></a><strong> often. What does it really mean?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>There are three core things. The first is bringing AI technology to underserved communities, such as Nepal. Our most successful product has been a platform for AI-assisted learning called <a href="https://www.fuseclassroom.com/">Fuse Classrooms</a>, which was adapted from the platform we created to teach fellows. It can inform teachers how students in their classes are doing, what material they’re struggling with, and what they should study to improve. It’s being sold in some markets for as cheap as a dollar, and it hasn’t been long, but altogether, we already have students logging half a million minutes a day.</p>



<p>The second is bringing high-quality AI-education programs as well, so that people in these communities can learn how to build AI themselves. People who live in underserved markets understand how and why AI can make a big impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third thing is enabling the skilled engineers we train to either find jobs or build their own AI technologies. When we accept fellows, our big focus is on training engineers further so they can impact their community. They will eventually become managers and create more demand for AI solutions and engineers.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>In the long run, we want to make AI education — really good AI education — available to everyone, getting to the bottom of the pyramid.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4><strong>How do you ensure your students aren’t just the elites in the developing countries where you work?</strong></h4>



<p>In Nepal, we’re already starting to partner with schools outside of Kathmandu, and we’re planning to pilot larger live online classes. In the long run, we want to make AI education — really good AI education — available to everyone, getting to the bottom of the pyramid. But we’re not there right now, because we don’t have enough resources. For example, there are students without access to a mobile device, and we can’t afford to buy them these devices. Right now, we mostly train people who studied computer science, most of whom are from Kathmandu. They’re elite in the sense that they can afford a phone and a laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re creating offline platforms, so that if students don’t have internet access but the school does, they can come to the school and download what they need for two or three weeks at a time and continue studying through the app. We also want to go downstream. In Nepal, there are 8 million students in school but only 400,000 in undergraduate programs. More than 7 million students just disappear, so we want to start teaching students in high school or earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>But you’re also a for-profit company. Where is the trade-off between that and the goal of truly democratizing AI?</strong></h4>



<p>The way we look at it is that we have two bottom lines. We have a for-profit company, so we need to make money and grow. We have investors who seek returns on their investment. But our other bottom line is democratizing AI such that it makes lives better for a lot of people. I think there are ways to achieve both; you have to find a balance. For example, our <a href="https://www.fusemachines.com/press/press-release/?id=fuse.ai-global-launch">Fusemachines fellowships</a> were open to anyone who wanted to learn, and half of the students from several cohorts were already employees at other companies. That didn’t make sense from a business perspective, but it did from a democratization perspective. We will probably seek grant funding to democratize beyond what we are able to do as a company.</p>



<h4><strong>Where do you think tomorrow’s AI talent will come from?</strong></h4>



<p>There will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737224/global-ai-talent-shortfall-tencent-report">a huge uptick in AI engineers</a> coming from developing countries, the way India became <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/india-engineering-degree/">a big center for software development</a> in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The trend will probably be similar, if not even more accelerated with AI, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>Hello everyone. I want to bring back one of my old articles. Wrote it in 2012. Long time ago. I found it while searching something on web archive site. 
I'll copy the content as it is, my thoughts on this topic haven't changed so much. This republishing is me paying tribute to that article.
</em></p>
<p>Test driven development is a very powerful thing. Although I don’t use it on every day basis, I’m a big admirer of the whole TDD concept. When I first heard of it, it made me laugh. It sounded impossible to me (especially for my poor skills). It was something like looking into the future. How the hell I can possibly know what and how will I implement something. Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>From my point of view, it’s not easy at all to cross the border and step into the TDD world. You have to think differently. And you probably won’t change your mind over night. Or maybe you will, like in my case when the TDD was the only way out of the problem.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-don-t-use-it-">Why I don’t use it?</h2>
<p>Well, let me present you one more scenario you are, I’m sure, familiar with. New requirements are there and, of course, deadline is near. If you step back and take a look at the whole picture, you’ll see that TDD can save you in general a lot of time. But when the deadline is near we are looking only the small piece of that picture. We just want to finish something before our next deployment, write some test after the implementation and forget about it (until our next meeting with Mr Debugger).</p>
<p>Another thing, I still think you need to be very experienced developer in order to perform truly test driven development all the time.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-do-use-it-">Why I do use it?</h2>
<p>As I wrote before, I didn’t “believe” in TDD until it provided me an exit from a very tricky situation with lots of conditions, loops and complicated logic. I started to write code in a usual way, finished few blocks of code, but soon it became so big I didn’t know where to change, what to change, and if I change something will it work as before. My brain was just over capacity. A colleague of mine told me I was ready for one “TDD session”. He started with really simple tests and forced me to write the rest. Of course, he helped me to finish it later, also with some refactoring. That was the point where I started to look differently at TDD.</p>
<p>I don’t always TDD… But when I do it, it’s because I’m working on something very very complicated, or it’s something I wan’t to be 300% sure it’s working as I want (some financial stuff for example). It doesn’t need to be complicated or serious all the time. I tend to do TDD when I feel I could easily make mistakes and spend more time in debug mode than in developing. Those are situations when I use TDD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</p>
<p>-- Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="short-example">Short example</h2>
<p>I hope this simple Java example will be enough to present you a basics of TDD. Imagine you have a simple ajax call and as a result you want your Java object presented as JSON. Ok, I know, you already have many ways to convert the Java object to JSON, but for this purpose lets convert it manually. As you can see in example below, there are a lot of double quotes. In Java, you have to escape them if you want to have them in your string, so there is a possibility that you will forget to escape all the double quotes. That’s one of the reasons I found this example interesting for TDD.</p>

      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"Open"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"OpenDoc()"</span>},
      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"Close"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"CloseDoc()"</span>}
    ]
  }
}}
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s say you have list of <code>User</code> objects, and you want to create JSON from it, but you don’t want to include all user fields, just few of them, for example first and last name.</p>
<p>We will start from the beginning. First we will write a test for a case when the list of users is <code>null</code>. For this case we will throw a <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>. I will use this example to show you how to properly test an exceptions.</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
<span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>testExtractUserNullAsList</span><span>()</span> </span>{
    
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>null</span>;

    <span>try</span> {
        
        ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);
    } <span>catch</span> (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        assertEquals(<span>"user list is null"</span>, e.getMessage());
        <span>throw</span> e;
    }
</code></pre><p>After that, you’ll write an implementation to make your test pass. Notice the line138, which is telling that it is OK for this test to throw the exception. Another thing, I put the method into the try-catch block. You can make this test pass without putting the method into the try-catch block. The thing is, when you have more complicated tests where you expect some method calls, only way to verify all of them is to verify them in the catch block and then re-throw the exception. So, if you omit the try-catch block, your test will pass (as you expect the exception) but many of your mocks won’t be verified. Below is simple implementation that will make the first test pass.</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>String</span> extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
   <span>if</span> (users == <span>null</span>) {
       <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
   }

   <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s make another test. This time, we will pass the empty list. We are taking care of the small things first. Later we will do the complicated things. That’s how you should write your tests. For now, we want the empty JSON object to be returned.</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>
<span>public</span> <span>void</span> testExtractUsersEmptyList() {
    
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>new</span> ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();

    
    <span>String</span> result = ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);

    
    assertEquals(<span>"{}"</span>, result);

}
</code></pre><p>After adding some code, our method now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>String</span> extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == <span>null</span>) {
        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
 }
</code></pre><p>The next thing, we want to write tests for case we have few users in that list. First, we will write a test, of course, where we will define what we want as a result of the method. That test will look something like this</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>
 <span>public</span> <span>void</span> testExtractUsers() {
    
    User john = createDummyUser(<span>1</span>, <span>"John"</span>, <span>"Doe"</span>);
    User jane = createDummyUser(<span>2</span>, <span>"Jane"</span>, <span>"Doe"</span>);
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>new</span> ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();
    users.add(john);
    users.add(jane);

    
    <span>String</span> result = ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);

    
    assertEquals(<span>"{\"users\":[{\"id\":\"1\",\"name\":\"John Doe\"},{\"id\":\"2\",\"name\":\"Jane Doe\"}]}"</span>, result);

 }
</code></pre><p>Of course, if we run this test now, it will fail. Now, we’ll extend our implementation. After finishing the implementation and successfully escaping all of the double quotes, my method now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);
        <span>for</span> (User u : users) {
            sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"id\":\""</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getId())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\","</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"name\":\""</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getFirstName())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>" "</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getLastName())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"}"</span>);
    }

    sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"]}"</span>);

    <span>return</span> sb.toString();

    }
 }
</code></pre><p>But, after running test, I realize I missed something. Test failed because I didn’t separate users by comma. This is where tests are also helpful. If I didn’t covered this with tests, I could continue to develop without noticing that I’m missing this comma and (maybe) I could have long debug time in Javascript in order to find why I can’t parse the response properly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597593139559/fRJ9Fiphv.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60"></p>
<p>Here’s my method after small modifications:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);
        <span>for</span> (User u : users) {
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"id\":\""</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getId())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\","</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"name\":\""</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getFirstName())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>" "</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getLastName())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"}"</span>);

        <span>if</span> (users.indexOf(u) &lt; users.size() - <span>1</span>) {
            sb.<span>append</span>(<span>","</span>);
        }
    }
    sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"]}"</span>);

    <span>return</span> sb.toString();

    }
}
</code></pre><p>OK, now I can continue. But, let’s say I don’t like that <code>indexOf(u)</code> mumbo jumbo magic. It doesn’t look nice. I have an idea and with all these tests, it won’t be a problem to do the refactoring. After all, refactoring is one of the steps in the TDD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fail, pass, refactor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One question for you. Imagine you have some complicated Javascript component that do a lot of work and hardly relies on your JSON response and you don’t have unit tests. Would you dare to do the refactoring if you have a deadline? Would you dare to do the refactoring at all? In this case, we have encountered with the double quotes escaping and adding commas. If we had few more things like that, every one of them will be a valid argument against the refactoring.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to the refactoring. In this example I’ll use <code>Iterator</code> because the <code>hasNext()</code> method will be perfect replacement in the <code>if</code> statement. Next step is to refactor until the tests are green again. After introducing <code>Iterator</code>, my method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();

        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);

        Iterator&lt;User&gt; userIterator = users.iterator();

        while (userIterator.hasNext()) {
            User u = userIterator.next();
           …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I hope you enjoyed reading these letters. I’ve certain enjoyed writing them. When I chat with new developers, at meetups, on slack, or via email, they let me know when letters are helpful or unclear. They suggest topics. They give me feedback, which, when you’re writing into the howling abyss of the internet, is very helpful both for calibrating your message and improving your motivation. </p>



<p>I’ve also posted these letters to <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/11/join-an-online-tech-community/">some online communities</a>. I’ve received plenty of feedback from those folks as well. Some kind, some caustic. That’s not unexpected.</p>



<p> After writing a hundred or so posts, I thought, there’s a book here. </p>



<p>And so I wrote one.</p>



<p>You can buy it from any of the usual suspects:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781484260739">Indiebound</a></li><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/letters-to-a-new-developer-what-i-wish-i-had-known-when-starting-my-development-career/9781484260739">Bookshop</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Letters-New-Developer-Starting-Development/dp/1484260732/">Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/letters-to-a-new-developer-dan-moore/1137054764">Barnes and Noble</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484260739">Apress US website</a> / <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484260739">Apress international website</a></li></ul>



<p>You can also check out a preview of the chapters on <a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484260739">the publisher’s website</a>. I’d love if you’d do so. </p>



<p>Here’s who I wrote it for:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>For new developers</strong><br>You are new to the software development job market. Perhaps you have completed a bootcamp or college degree. You may refer to yourself as an entry level or junior engineer.</p><p>While everyone’s background and skills growth happens at different speeds, new developers generally have less than five years of professional experience. Many new developers are worried about their abilities, don’t feel welcome, and have a difficult time finding that first job.</p><p>But as an industry, we need more new developers. There are so many problems with which software can help. Companies want experienced engineers, but all the senior developers I know started out as new developers. A senior engineer is just a new engineer seasoned with gaffes, education, and time.</p><p>For new developers, this book will help you avoid missteps I’ve made. It also introduces you to disciplines beyond coding critical to success. While programming is crucial for any software product or service, there is much more required to deliver an application.</p><p><strong>For anyone considering software development<br></strong>If you’re not sure if software engineering is right for you, this book offers perspectives on how to succeed.</p><p>I’ve intentionally kept the barriers to the layperson low with limited technical jargon. Only a few technologies are discussed, and those sections can be skipped. If you are thinking about becoming a developer, I’d recommend buying this book and a book about programming.</p><p>Giving a computer commands that it can execute is an important skill for any software developer. But software engineering is so much more. You must know what to build, how to work with your team, and how to maintain your systems.</p><p><strong>For mentors<br></strong>If you are mentoring a new developer, this book can serve as a discussion guide. Because each chapter has letters approaching a theme from different angles, you and your mentee will find it useful for focused mentoring sessions.</p><p>As an experienced developer, you’ll of course bring your own insights and experience to each topic, from your debugging process to the value of an online community for continuous learning.</p><p>And, of course, you may have had a different experience than what I share. Such contrasts are a jumping-off point to discuss the diversity available in a software development career.</p><cite>Introduction, “Letters To a New Developer”</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>



<p>PS If you <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/contact/">shoot me an email</a>, I’ll give you a discount code.</p>

</p>


<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<date>Published: 2020-08-15 | Categories: <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/engineering"><span>[»]</span> Engineering</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/optics"><span>[»]</span> Optics</a></b>and<b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/programming"><span>[»]</span> Programming</a></b>.</date>
<p>4 Months and 400 hours were necessary to bring life to the Spectrum Analyzer software that I am glad to announce to you today.</p>

<p>The software, which was initially modest, has grown into a fully functional program suite that covers most of the features traditionally implemented in commercial spectroscopy software. It includes single and live acquisition of spectra, loading/saving and export to clipboard, filtering, baseline removal and an automated calibration algorithm that I specially designed for the occasion. A screenshot of the software performing a calibration is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figure><img src="http://www.thepulsar.be/images/spectrum-analyzer-software-for-openraman/screenshot.png"><figcaption>Figure 1 – Spectrum Analyzer software screenshot</figcaption></figure>

<p>A <a href="http://www.open-raman.org/build/software/" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> specific page</a> was created on the companion website to host the latest version of the software for download. As the rest of the project, the software is distributed under the open-source CERN OHL-W v2 license.</p>

<p>Although the software was designed to interface to the OpenRAMAN spectrometers, it will actually work with any dispersion-based spectrometers using PointGrey camera. It may even work with different camera manufacturers or with CCD linear array as long as you provide a DLL to interface to the hardware. The source code is given with a the DLL necessary to interface to PointGrey cameras, which can be used as an example on how to implement other camera types. The program even support multiple spectrometers connected to the same computer using each a different hardware! I don’t know if that will actually be useful but I made it as flexible as possible to avoid restrictions that would later block some users.</p>

<p>The software will work with either .CSV files or with a custom file format that I implemented using an upgraded version of the technique I presented <a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/article/implementing-object-persistence-in-c--"><span>[»]</span> here</a>. One of the most challenging difficulty I had to face was to allow 32 bits version of the software to load the files saved with the 64 bits version. This seems easy at glance but the original technique I developed do not cope well with that. One advantage of the custom file format is that the files contains the data, the blank and all the program settings (filtering, calibration etc.) so that you can tweak them later.</p>

<p>As explained above, the software also features an automated calibration procedure. You simply measured the spectra of a Neon or Argon-Mercury lamp, give the number of peaks that appears on screen and click on the “calibrate!” button. The algorithm is extremely robust to missing peaks and converge to a solution within a few seconds (4 seconds on my super-old laptop). By default, the algorithm will look on a very broad range of parameters, which basically cover the whole visible region of the spectrum, but advanced user can also tune the settings when necessary.</p>

<p>The software also implements many other features like time-lapsed acquisitions to monitor reactions, automatic saving of spectra, baseline removal algorithm and Savitzky-Golay filtering. The user can also freely choose between wavelength and Raman shifts axis, save and import calibration data etc. Also, the calibration will be saved inside the camera so if you connect the spectrometer to a different computer it will remain calibrated!</p>

<p>I invite you to test the software to discover all the possibilities. You don’t have to possess a spectrometer to run the software as you can import any .CSV file where the first column represents the x-axis and the second column the y-axis.</p>

<p>During the next weeks/months, I will post detailed articles on how the major features were implemented. The first article will be about the automated calibration procedure.</p>

<p>I would like to give a big thanks to <b>James</b> who has supported this post through Patreon. I also take the occasion to invite you to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thepulsar" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> donate</a> through Patreon, even as little as $1.

Let's start with an important question...</p><p id="viewer-vcge"><span><em>How much do employees really accomplish in a 40+ hour work weeks? <strong>On avg. 15 hours... </strong></em></span></p><p id="viewer-a7ej"><strong>Wasted Time</strong></p><p id="viewer-8pnvh"><span><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fg1q7">Americans typically waste about five to ten hours each week, in their commute to work. That means they may be clocked in for 40 hours each week, but really they invest closer to 50 hours each week. </p><p id="viewer-4bphf"><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong>
While at work corporate employees must foster and nurture their relationships with their coworkers. That's at least an hour or two of water cooler talk and gossip. </p><p id="viewer-95vrl"><span><strong>-15 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-4352n">Then there are constraints of managing our existing relationships in our lives through social media and cellular devices that take two or three more hours of our time. </p><p id="viewer-fgpg6">That leaves about three hours of work that actually gets done each day, equalling on average 15 hours of productive work per week. I<span>t is next to impossible to expect employees to work productively for such long periods. You will not get their best work since science explains mental and physical fatigue will set in, no matter the amount of caffeine consumption.</span></p><p id="viewer-4nsh9"><span>Here's the tough part of the sell for the companies to digest. <strong>Pay your employee the same salary that you've paid them for the 40+ hours they currently work.</strong> Now wash that down with some cold hard facts. </span></p><p id="viewer-7kn60"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #1: </strong></p><p id="viewer-d6gkv">Most employees have been more productive since working from home.</p><p id="viewer-8lqkg"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #2:</strong></p><p id="viewer-bismg">Fatigue limits productive work.</p><p id="viewer-ep8oa"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #3:</strong></p><p id="viewer-e6bbk">Happy employees are more productive and perform significantly better.</p><p id="viewer-3k395"><strong>Monday - Work From Home 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-kf6g">Monday is work from home for six hours. This eliminates the 'Monday Blues' that most employees go through. Imagine after a relaxing Sunday, attending church and finishing errands to prepare for the week ahead, you get to work from home. Your employees become elated, generating more endorphins, which ultimately peaks productivity during this work period (and the rest of the week).</p><p id="viewer-b3cgk"><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - Work In Office 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-2g9sq">Doing this eliminates fatigue of your employees. Ultimately, maximizing peak performance periods. Less time, equals more attention to detail and more focus, which maximizes this 18 hour period. This also increases revenue for coffee in the morning, and happy hours after work because more time is available. And let's face it, going to work creates a different moral and team chemistry that is ultimately necessary to benefit the company.</p><p id="viewer-bdooq"><strong>Friday, Saturday, Sunday - Off</strong></p><p id="viewer-4sqa4">What do most people do on a three day weekend? Travel locally, travel on quick weekend trips, and ultimately spend more money. Most people are typically paid on Friday. People typically spend their money on the weekend. Increasing the time on the weekend, increases the opportunity for people to spend more money.</p><h2 id="viewer-295t5"><strong>Spending more money = Better for the economy</strong></h2><p id="viewer-fqd79"><span>And ironically, by following the weekly model listed above, your employees will get even more done in less time...</span></p><div id="viewer-8mkgr"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.sboxc.com/post/working-less-is-better-for-the-economy" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/94b87b_83356fb2e8ee482fa7c5939ad5922499~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1024,h_768,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/94b87b_83356fb2e8ee482fa7c5939ad5922499~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

	<p>I host Google fonts locally not only to load them faster but also to take advantage of font loading strategies which goes directly to the heart of creating the ultimate user experience.</p>
<p>Hosting Google fonts locally to boost speed is one thing. Knowing how to load them with an effective strategy that strikes a perfect balance between performance and user perception is another.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, browsers are not quite where we'd like them to be in terms how they handle custom fonts which leaves us to our own devices when deciding on a suitable font loading strategy.</p>
<p>While some of these strategies are still nowhere near perfect, one thing remains certain. You'll need to host Google fonts locally if you want to retain maximum control.</p>

</div>
<div data-node="5f325adb20cc1">
	<div>
		<div>
	<p>Without intervention font loading is primarily handled by the browser.</p>
<p>If your preferred font fails to load due to a slow download, the browser will mitigate this by loading a fallback (system) font.</p>
<p>A system font is a font used by your operating system to display text. Common system fonts include Arial, Times New Roman and Georgia.</p>
<p>A fallback font is basically a preferred system font that you specify.</p>
<p><picture><source data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-srcset="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="specifying preferred google font plus fallback fonts" data-src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png" data-srcset="" data-sizes="" data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-style="" data-l="" src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png"></picture></p>
<p>Here is a table illustrating the behavior adopted by some of the popular browsers.</p>
<p><picture><source data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-srcset="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="times that browsers wait before loading fallback fonts" data-src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png" data-srcset="" data-sizes="" data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-style="" data-l="" src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png"></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome, Opera and Firefox timeout after 3 seconds. At this point, text will be displayed using the fallback font. As soon as the primary font is available, the text will be re-rendered. Herein lies the problem of FOUT and reflows. Text rendered using the fallback font is referred to as a flash of unformatted text (FOUT). A reflow occurs when the primary font becomes available and the text is re-rendered. Not sure about you but I've experienced this often and found it to be disruptive.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer renders text immediately due to a zero second timeout. A fallback font is used if the primary font is unavailable and re-rendering takes place once the primary font is ready. The benefit of FOUT is that, at very least, the user is faced with text immediately. However, this comes at the expense of a perfect user experience.</li>
<li>Safari has no timeout leaving users without text until such time that the primary font is downloaded and ready for use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to the 3 second timeout with Chrome, Opera and Firefox (or no timeout in the case with Safari), a slow connection or a delay in the Google font download will likely leave users with a flash of invisible text (FOIT).</p>
<p>To add fuel to the fire, our font loading strategy is limited.</p>
<p>The relatively new <code>font-display: block | swap | fallback | optional | auto</code> descriptor allows you to control how your font renders <strong>before</strong> it is fully loaded but is by no means a perfect solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>block</strong> - FOIT + infinite swap period. The invisible fallback text is replaced as soon as the designated font is available.</li>
<li><strong>swap</strong> - FOUT + infinite swap period. The fallback font is replaced as soon as the primary font is ready for us.</li>
<li><strong>fallback</strong> - Almost imperceptible block period (&lt;= 100ms) + small swap period (FOUT + swap).</li>
<li><strong>optional</strong> - Almost imperceptible block period (&lt;= 100ms) + no swap. Great for best user experience where content is preferential to aesthetics.</li>
<li><strong>auto</strong> - based on user agent (browser) strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Prior to May 2019 the use of the font-display descriptor could only be achieved when hosting Google fonts locally due to the CSS being hosted on your own server.</p>
<p>OK, with a very basic understanding of font loading, let's forge on.</p>
</div>
	</div>

<div data-node="5f325c72c8b3c">

</div>
<div data-node="5f325c828a6c8">
	<div>
		<div>
	<p>What I've learned from experience is that FOIT is not always FOIT.</p>
<p>Sound cryptic?</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where a site uses white text over a dark image.</p>
<p>Where the internet connection is fast the text may load concurrently with, or just before, the image. No problems here.</p>
<p>But if the connection happens to slow down temporarily or even sometimes on first load of a site in a browser with a clean cache and/or where one's PC is also busy with some background process/es, it can appear as if&nbsp; the header and navigation loads before the text and image, leaving a mostly blank screen.</p>
<p>That said, the text may, in fact have loaded but in the absence of an image the white text is invisible on a white background. So what one may think is FOIT, may in fact have been white text on a white background.</p>
<p>The solution is to use a solid color overlay that will allow text to show while waiting for the image to load. The image may load after milliseconds but it's still preferable to an almost blank screen. The other option is to change the text color.</p>
</div>

<div data-node="5f325cf3cc198">

</div>
<div data-node="5f325d07e4f4a">
	<div>
		<div>
	<p>For starters, the more HTTP requests to external sites needed to render your page/s, the slower your site will load. To exacerbate this, scripts and CSS are render blocking so poor optimization coupled with a slow server and a bloated theme could prove disastrous to user experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, being called by CSS, Google fonts are no exception to the render blocking conundrum.</p>
<p>Render blocking occurs when the parsing of HTML needed to render the page is paused (blocked) temporarily until all scripts and CSS complete their processes.</p>
<p>Besides a number of granular optimizations, <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/optimization/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the most important factors affecting page speed</a> (in this order) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting</li>
<li>Theme Choice</li>
<li>Caching</li>
</ul>
</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div data-node="5f325db632936">
	<div>
		<div>
	<p>A fast site is crucial for optimal font loading and this starts with hosting.</p>
<p>No amount of optimizing can compensate for a lack of speed.</p>
<p>And because the whole objective of hosting Google fonts locally is to improve user experience, it would be counterproductive to consider unless you can outperform font delivery provided by Google's cloud servers and CDN.</p>
<p>A shared server is highly unlikely to outperform Google's servers.</p>
<p>I used to host with Siteground but because I wasn't seeing the type of speed I wanted, I switched to Cloudways. This site is served from a Digital Ocean server in New York and it's blazing fast.</p>
<p>On top of that, Siteground's renewal fees are crazy.</p>
<p>With Cloudways you can get a <a title="Cloudways" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/cloudways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hosting plan for as little as $10 per month</a> which will allow at least as many site visits as Siteground's best shared hosting plan at $35 per month.</p>
<p>And that gives you fully dedicated resources and the benefit of Pay-As-You-Go pricing, i.e. No Contracts.</p>

	<p>A lightweight, well coded and optimized theme with a good caching plugin like WP Rocket is the next most important speed factor.</p>
<p>I don't venture past anything but a <a title="Studiopress" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/studiopress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">StudioPress theme</a> (Genesis Framework) because there's just nothing that comes close in terms of optimization, i.e. clean coding, zero bloat plus the ability to create any type of site. And while you may expect a theme of such caliber to be pricey, they're actually cheaper.</p>
<p>The licence provides you with <strong>unlimited everything</strong>. So for a <strong>once off cost</strong> you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifetime updates</li>
<li>Lifetime support and ...</li>
<li>You can use the theme on as many sites as you like.</li>

	<p>Caching is absolutely crucial when it comes to font loading. While there's certainly no shortage of caching plugins, there are only two contenders in my view:</p>
<ul>
<li>WP Rocket.</li>
<li>Swift Performance Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="WPRocket" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/wprocket/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WP Rocket</a> is rock solid and has been around for way longer than Swift Performance Pro.</p>
<p>As a result, they've long since ironed out all the small bugs and it's also really simple to setup and works out of the box.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-rocket-review-plus-ideal-settings/">WP Rocket Review And Setup Guide.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Swift Performance Pro offers more granular control. However, it's better suited to those who have a bit of knowledge and experience when it comes to caching.</p>
<p>If you really want to harness it's full features you'll need to know what you're doing and be prepared to <a href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/swift-performance-review-and-settings/">experiment until you find the settings that give you the best results</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Savings accounts allow you to save money with a regulated financial institution and earn some interest. There are several types of savings accounts, but they mostly revolve around three themes - easy access, notice and fixed savings. Easy access accounts allow you to withdraw your money whenever you want. Notice accounts require you to give your provider a few days' notice before making a withdrawal. Fixed accounts allow you to save your money for a fixed period at a guaranteed interest rate. This rate is usually slightly higher than notice or easy access accounts.<br>‍<br><strong>Your money is protected up to £85,000:</strong><br>When you save money in an authorised financial institution, your savings are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means if the financial institution goes bust, you can claim your money back up to £85,000 per financial institution (£170,000 for joint accounts). So, if you have a lot of money to save, it might be wise to spread it across different financial institutions. We recommend you save at most £83,000 in one institution, leaving some room for interest.<br>‍<br>Some of these financial institutions have a shared licence, which means they share their licence with another institution. If you put your money in two institutions that share a licence and both go bust, you'll only be entitled to a maximum of £85,000 from the FSCS. Examples of financial institutions that share a licence are Halifax, Bank of Scotland and BM Savings (all three share the same licence).<br>‍<br><strong>Most people won't pay taxes on savings' income:</strong><br>Depending on your income tax band, you may not have to pay taxes on interest earned on savings. For example, basic-rate taxpayers can earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free every year. Higher-rate taxpayers can earn up to £500. Additional-rate taxpayers have no tax-free allowance. If you are interested in tax-free accounts, have a look at <a href="https://www.koody.co/saving/isa">ISAs</a>.<br>‍<br>Below, you'll find the easy access, notice and fixed-rate savings accounts which pay the highest interest at the moment. These are not recommendations. They are simply the savings accounts with highest interest rates. All financial institutions we list are regulated by the FCA, and their savings accounts are protected by the FSCS up to £85,000.<br></p><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea8e1014488c25d7742640f/5f227e4d58bbc37bc1507dec_savings-accounts-sign-500x500px.png" alt="Savings accounts are almost tax free" height="300"></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I want to show you some ways to represent puzzles with four spatial dimensions. Even though the fourth dimension is used to make the puzzles more exciting, 4D puzzles can show the simplicity of adding one dimension. Playing these puzzles helps visualizing more dimensions than the three we notice in day-to-day life.</p>
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
<p>If you don't look too closely, a grain of sand is a 0D object, a thread 1D, a piece of paper 2D, and a block of wood 3D.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTQ5NjEucG5n/original/gLK56i.png"></p>
<p>In a 1D world you can only move forward and backward, in 2D you can also move left and right. Moving diagonally is a combination of the others, so doesn't count as a new direction. In 3D you can also go up and down, and for 4D we add two more directions.</p>
<p>To check the number of dimensions of space, get as many sticks as possible perpendicular to each other (as seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KC32Vymo0Q#t=4m50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). You get to three in this universe, if your sticks aren't too fancy.</p>
<h2>Projections</h2>
<p>What's the use of talking about four dimensions in a 3D world? The same as talking about 3D games or any other seemingly 3D thing on your 2D computer screen, TV, canvas or paper. Things can feel 3D or 4D, even though the final product is 2D. Squashing an object to lower dimensions, like taking a picture or making a shadow on a wall, is called projection. You can always project, project, project, all the way down to zero dimensions. Here is a projection of a ball:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDEucG5n/original/qq3UFp.png"></p>
<p>and here's the projection from the top of that projection:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAzNDkucG5n/original/Q3XkUN.png"></p>
<h2>Slices</h2>
<p>Our human eyes use projections, but wouldn't it be nicer to be more alien and look at things like an MRI-scanner? Instead of having your vision blocked by the surface of objects, let's slice them up so you can look inside them. You have to choose how thinly you want to slice things. More slices means there is less space per slice in your field of vision, but less slices means you might miss things in between your slices. Here is the sliced up ball, which turns out to have an orange inside:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDIucG5n/original/mFaZ9u.png"></p>
<h2>Pre-chopped space</h2>
<p>Games are easier to slice up if the playing field is made of separate squares, like chess or checkers, where you jump between places. (These are technically 1D, but the 2D description is simpler.) You can then give each square a name or number:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxMjcucG5n/original/GSC5NU.png">,<br>which can be sliced up like this:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNDIucG5n/original/RrCPkZ.png">.<br>The left square in the left slice is next to the left square in the right slice, so 1 is still next to 2 and 3; 2 is still next to 1 and 4, etc. This doesn't accomplish much, but now we have room for a third dimension on our 2D screen:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNTYucG5n/original/IH8VTb.png">,<br>where 1 is now next to 2, 3 and 5. 7 is next to 5, 8 and 3. To get to 4D, we can also put slices vertically:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNzkucG5n/original/J5%2FNYB.png">.<br>Now 1 has four neighbors: 2, 3, 5 and 9, because 5 and 9 are in the same position in adjacent slices. This is like putting two cubes next to each other, and acting like the same positions inside the two cubes are adjacent. </p>
<h2>Mazes</h2>
<p>The most basic way to explore a 4D space is to just walk around. To make the walking around a little bit more interesting, people make mazes.</p>
<h2>Some examples</h2>
<p>Going on a quest to find examples of 4D mazes and puzzles leads you through some great old-school web pages like <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm</a>. There are multiple people who seemingly made it their life's work to collect information about 4D things and mazes. A handy start is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games</a>.<br>Different types of representations are in that list. First, there's the projection of higher dimensional things on a 2D screen seen in <a href="http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm</a>. </p>
<p>Then there's the option of taking a 3D slice of a 4D world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q</a>. The maker of that video, Marc ten Bosch, has done a lot of work in this field, and is now working on <a href="https://miegakure.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Miegakure</a>. Miegakure stands out because it's more polished than other 4D games, and you can smoothly walk around, instead of step by step. </p>
<p>Finally, instead of slicing just once, you can use the 2D grid of 2D slices we've seen before. This 4D crossword puzzle is a simple example: <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html</a>, and there's more to be found here: <a href="http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/</a>. Here's a 2x2x2x2 solved crossword:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUzNTgucG5n/original/%2F0qVeK.png">.<br>Notice words&nbsp;like&nbsp;ai&nbsp;(a&nbsp;type&nbsp;of&nbsp;sloth),&nbsp;ti&nbsp;and&nbsp;no.&nbsp;(aa&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=aa+lava&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" rel="nofollow noopener">rough lava</a>. <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/2-letter-words.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">This list of 2-letter words</a> was helpful.)
</p>
<h2>Triangles and big wally squares</h2>
<p>If you want to have a clear overview of a 4D maze, this 2D grid of 2D slices is often used. There are two ways these mazes are represented: Spaces with lines in between, or having walls and open squares take up the same amount of space. The first one seems more natural for drawing mazes: you take a blank piece of paper and draw walls on it using your pen lines. The second one is like using graph paper and coloring in squares for walls. <br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUwNzMucG5n/original/xdpYOa.png"></p>
<p>To walk around in 4D, the thin wall system needs to show possible moves between slices. Usually triangles point in the direction of the square to jump to (like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/mazes/comments/71syq5/10x10x10x10_4d_maze/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). In the next picture, the way from 1 to 3 is blocked, but 2 has a triangle pointing to the right, so you can reach 4 from there. The triangle to the left in 4 also allows to go back to 2 from 4. (Everybody colors these triangles, so I do too.)</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNDgucG5n/original/aBTxbK.png"></p>
<p>The thick wall maze expands more naturally to four dimensions when using 2D slices. With square walls, you can move to the same position on adjacent squares. To show a passage, you can show an absent wall on the next slice. This is the system used in <a href="https://trudieprod.itch.io/boxpusher-4d">Boxpusher 4D</a>. </p>
<p> In these examples you can follow the same route from the top left all the way through the maze:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTAucG5n/original/kMAvRk.png">.</p>
<p>Here is the route:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU0NjAucG5n/original/z6RPSJ.png">.</p>
<p>With thin walls, you need a lot of triangles for a big empty room. Thick walls are thus better for games which have more open spaces:
</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTIucG5n/original/lu7xCn.png"></p>
<p>Thick wall games also feel less like you're teleporting, although that still is an issue in getting that 4D feeling.</p>
<h2>Making it feel 4D</h2>
<p>Letting things feel 4D instead of some weird thing where you teleport around is quite challenging. One thing that helps is switching dimensions around to show that you get the same puzzle in a different view. Here is the same maze as before to the left, and on the right a version with the dimensions switched:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNTA3MTYucG5n/original/IKuKDY.png">.</p>
<p>On the right, the first six steps are still in a U-shape, but now you jump between slices. Next, where in the left maze you jump two slices to the right, in the right maze there are two little steps. The same steps in both mazes are shown in green.</p>
<p>Something else that works well is when you can't see everything on your screen at once, like with a 10x10x10x10 map on a 4x4x4x4 grid, and you scroll in different directions.</p>
<h2>6D? 20D?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can expand this approach to n dimensions. You do need enough screen space. And it probably gets confusing.</p></section></div>]]>

<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.
</p><p><span>So why is software still slow?</span>
</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud? Why does your web browser take 3, 4, 10 seconds to load a web page? Why does your phone struggle to keep more than a few apps open at a time? And why does each update somehow make the problem worse?
</p><p><span>We made it slow</span>.
</p><p>Not necessarily you, not necessarily me, not necessarily any single person in particular. But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

...

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially. This is shown in the following graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png 600w"><figcaption>Average time to create one object increases with the number of objects on the heap <a href="https://jsperf.com/cost-of-objects">(Data Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>So the question arises if CRDTs are actually suitable for shared editing on the web, or if they impose a too significant cost to be viable in practice.</p><p>In case you don't know me, I'm the author of a CRDT implementation named <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a>, that is specifically designed for building shared editing applications on the web.</p><p>In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {

Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

		<p><em><span>A</span></em><span><em><span>n Ecology of Mind</span></em></span><span> </span><span> is a film portrait of Gregory Bateson, celebrated anthropologist, philosopher, author, naturalist, systems theorist, and filmmaker, produced and directed by his daughter, Nora Bateson.</span></p>
		<p><span>T<span>he</span></span><span> film includes footage from Bateson’s own films shot in the 1930s in Bali (with Margaret Mead) and New Guinea, along with photographs, filmed lectures, and interviews.  His youngest child, Nora, depicts him as a man who studied the interrelationships of the complex systems in which we live with a depth motivated by scientific rigor and caring integrity.</span></p>
		<p><span>N<span>ora</span></span> Bateson’s rediscovery of his work documents the vast – and continuing – influence Bateson’s thinking has had on the work of an amazingly wide range of disciplines.  Through contemporary interviews, along with his own words, Bateson’s way of thinking reveals practical approaches to the enormous challenges confronting the human race and the natural world.</p>
		<p><span>G<span>regory</span></span> Bateson’s theories, such as “the double bind” and “the pattern which connects”, continue to impact the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, information science, cybernetics, urban planning, biology, and ecology, challenging people to think in new ways.   </p>
		<p><span>U</span><span>ntil now, his work has been largely inaccessible to most of us.  Through this film, Nora Bateson sets out to show that his ideas are not just fodder for academic theory, but can help instruct a way of life. She presents his thinking using a richly personal perspective, focusing on the stories Bateson used to present his ideas and how the beauty of life itself provided the framework of his life’s pursuits.</span></p>
		<p><span>T</span><span>his film hopes to inspire its audience to see our lives within a larger system - glistening with symmetry, play, and metaphor. An invitation to ask the kinds of questions that could help thread the world back together from the inside.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

8 minute read
</p>
<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>When I graduated from college, my dream was to lead a team at a startup. Over the past decade, I’ve had the opportunity to serve in a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/work/">variety of engineering and management roles</a> with funded tech startups and, most recently I joined The Graide Network as their <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/joining-the-graide-network">Chief Technology Officer</a>.</p>
<p>The Graide Network was my dream job. I got to pick the tech stack, hire the team, make important decisions, and speak and write about all of it. It was challenging, exciting, and it felt like something I’d want to do forever.</p>
<p>In 2020, when Covid-19 struck, the business hit a wall. Our customers (K-12 schools) tightened their budgets, and like many early-stage startups, we had to let a few team members go. I had been managing the engineering team for four years, and now and after Covid, the team had contracted to just one other developer and me.</p>
<p>As I reflected on my career, I realized that it was time for a change. I had grown very comfortable as an early-stage startup CTO, and I was afraid that by continuing with The Graide Network (or finding a similar startup job), I would remain safely in my comfort zone forever.</p>
<h2 id="the-comfort-zone-the-most-dangerous-place-to-be">The Comfort Zone: The Most Dangerous Place to Be</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you opt for a safe life, you will never know what it’s like to win.”
<strong>- Richard Branson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mECllQz.jpg" alt="Get out of your comfort zone"></p>
<p>Every leap forward I’ve made in my career has been followed by a visceral, gut-wrenching increase in anxiety.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember being brought into a meeting with the founders when I was at Packback and being told that our Head of Engineering was leaving and that I’d be taking over. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t stop thinking, worrying, and asking myself what the hell I was going to do.</p>
<p>The same feeling carried me through <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary">my first conference talk</a>. I had spoken in front of small audiences in meetings and informal settings, but being on stage with lights and a microphone, and a timer was sickening. I basically blacked out and, at some point, walked off stage while people clapped politely.</p>
<p>But, after leading small engineering teams for over five years at early stage startups, the job had become mundane. I had a process for everything, I knew what the most likely technical and business challenges were going to be, and I was getting great reviews from my teammates. I’m not saying I was the world’s best engineer or manager, but I had reached a level of adequacy that allowed me to be very comfortable.</p>
<p>While living in my comfort zone, I wasn’t having sleepless periods of frantic anxiety, but I also wasn’t growing.</p>
<h2 id="the-hedgehog-concept">The Hedgehog Concept</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hedgehog Concept comes from the Greek fable about the fox and the hedgehog: while the wily fox knows many things, the simple hedgehog only knows one thing, but that one knowledge bite is highly impactful in protecting itself against danger.
<strong>- Jim Collins</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing that I needed to be chasing growth, I began contemplating a more significant career pivot, and <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html">Jim Collins’ Hedgehog Concept</a> kept coming to mind. The Hedgehog Concept says that to build something <em>great</em>, you have to focus on the intersection of these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are you deeply passionate about?</li>
<li>What can you be the best in the world at?</li>
<li>What drives your economic engine?</li>
</ol>

<p>Collins was talking about building companies, but it’s true for careers as well. My job as an engineering leader had allowed me to earn good money, but I wasn’t going to be the best in the world at it, and I wouldn’t call engineering my life’s passion. When I think about what people might say at my funeral, it’s not, “Oh, Karl, he was a great engineer.”</p>
<p>As I started exploring my options, talking to friends and mentors, and weighing various business ideas, I kept wondering what I really wanted to be the “best in the world at?”</p>
<h2 id="the-best-at-one-thing-or-pretty-good-at-two-things">The Best at One Thing or Pretty Good at Two Things?</h2>
<p>Several years ago, I read <a href="https://amzn.to/2BEjOWx"><em>How To Fail at Almost Everything And Still Win Big</em></a>, by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. While I don’t agree with much of Adams’ politics, the book is full of sage advice for anyone who thinks differently from the mainstream.</p>
<p>One of my biggest takeaways was Adams’ idea about combining skills:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>Become the best at one specific thing.</li>
<li>Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility…I don’t recommend anyone even try. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.

<p>Adams goes on to talk about how he was never going to be the best cartoonist, but he was pretty good at it and had a business background that was unique in the field. He realized that he didn’t want to compete with the best cartoonists, but instead to compete with the <em>very few</em> people who were good cartoonists with a prior career in business.</p>
<p>This simple yet brilliant idea makes becoming successful an order of magnitude easier.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>As I thought about my skills, passions, and the things that people would pay me for, I started to think about <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/writing/">writing</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved writing. It’s therapeutic and allows me to help, teach, and encourage others. My final internship in college was as a technical writer, and a few companies had approached me about writing for their blogs. I figured that if I could find a few clients to pay me to write, I’d make a go of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-two-months">The First Two Months</h2>
<p>In May 2020, I <a href="https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms">found a list of freelance technical writing opportunities</a>, and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/start-freelance-blogging">I started applying</a>. By June, I had written for six different clients, and I was starting to trade out some of my lower-paying clients for higher-paying ones. I wasn’t making as much as I would as a developer, but I started to see a path forward.</p>
<p>I talked to my CEO at The Graide Network to let her know that <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-gave-my-notice-im-going-full-time-b37d46266b">I’d be transitioning out</a> by the end of the summer. I offered to ramp down slowly and stay on as a part-time advisor if she thought it would help. This eased the transition and allowed me to start thinking about how I could make a real living as a writer.</p>
<h2 id="the-fish-start-biting">The Fish Start Biting</h2>
<p>After writing a few articles and continuing to comb through my network, I had more work than I could handle.</p>
<p>I found out that companies have a really hard time finding experienced software engineers who are also good writers and started to wonder if the market might be bigger than I first thought. I was doing almost zero outbound sales and still being approached by 2-3 new clients per week. Several of my early clients had mentioned job opportunities, and people referred business to me from all over.</p>
<p>So, I did the logical thing and kept raising my rates.</p>
<p>While this priced out some of my early clients, they understood that I needed to make a living.</p>
<h2 id="so-this-is-product-market-fit">So this is Product-Market Fit?</h2>
<p>As I continued to field interest, I kept thinking about Justin Jackson’s essay, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jump"><em>What Does Product-Market Fit Feel Like?</em></a> In it, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without you having to try too hard, customers should be showing up to buy your product…Many of the problems entrepreneurs face are related to <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/niche"><strong>targeting a niche</strong></a> where there aren’t a lot of fish, or the fish aren’t biting.
<strong>- Justin Jackson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had worked with several startups where sales were <em>by far</em> the biggest challenge. Reflecting on those experiences, I realized that <strong>my past startups were trying to convince people to pay for something completely new.</strong> While this path makes sense for funded startups, I expected to spend months finding my first few clients, and instead, I had stumbled into a pond filled with hungry fish. It was exciting and a little bit scary.</p>
<p>I started to think about what it would take to scale this business up.</p>
<h2 id="productize-and-scale">Productize and Scale</h2>
<p>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://bootstrappedweb.com/">Brian Casel’s Bootstrapped Web podcast</a> for the past year. Brian runs a business called <a href="https://audienceops.com/">AudienceOps</a>, a “productized” content writing service where he’s been able to serve more clients and grow a profitable lifestyle business that runs mostly without him.</p>
<p>While I enjoy writing, I was nervous about freelancing full-time forever. What happens if I want to take a month off? If I have to keep increasing my rates, will I only be able to work with huge, boring clients? Will I get sick of writing variations on the same few technical topics for years?</p>
<p>One of my long-term career goals has always been to start a business. Freelancers may be self-employed, but they’re really just working several small jobs, so I knew I wanted to do something bigger than that.</p>
<p>In July, I stopped taking clients who wanted to hire me specifically and started redirecting them to my fledgling agency, <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft</a>. While I imagine I’ll continue doing much of the writing this year, hiring other writers allows me to continue focusing on hard (to me) problems like sales, marketing, and building processes.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-corner-store">The New “Corner Store”</h2>
<p>Compared with the ambitious, venture-funded startups I worked for in the past, Draft is so…simple. There are customers with a need, and I have a skill that helps them meet that need. If I’m smart, I’ll be able to operationalize it and get out of the day-to-day within a few years. To me, that sounds like a fascinating problem to solve, even if it’s not something worthy of outside investment.</p>
<p>I see online lifestyle businesses like mine as the “corner store” of our generation. Our grandparents could lease a storefront, and (with a little luck and hard work) ride the wave of growing prosperity in their neighborhood to make a living. I’m not going to build the next Facebook, but there’s enough growth in the technology sector to make a living in lots of little niches you might not have expected.</p>
<p>So that’s why I left my career as a startup CTO to become a writer. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Find me on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups">sign up for my newsletter</a> if you want to follow along.</p>
