November 22, 2020 | https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I have mentioned that applications duplicate operating system's functionality.
How severe issue is it and what kind of consequences there are?</p>
<p><a href="https://gottcode.org/kapow/">Kapow punch clock</a> tracks hours and constructs reports.
Its author has done well in maintaining complexity.
The whole program is only 4171 lines (+594 lines of copyright headers),
with total 146kB of source code.
This post presents a program for Plan 9 that serves the same purpose.
Finally lets do some comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="kapow screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/kapow.png"></p>
<p>The source code presented is attached: <a href="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.zip">task.zip</a></p>
<h2>task entries</h2>
<p>The clock has this kind of a nice directory -tab.
I have seen this tool being used.
The tabs were used to track customer_project_day instead of projects.
The dialog looks like a file browser.</p>
<p>The 'task' program treats each task as a file.
For instance here's the '0.kapow.task'.</p>
<pre><code>Punch clock port experiment
</code><code>start: Sat Nov 21 11:00:06 GMT 2020</code></pre>
<p>This is a running task.
When I'm done, I append in the stop: -line.</p>
<p>The time stamps aren't using Finnish abbreviations for weekdays or months
and it is bit inconvenient for me.
Though they are slightly more convenient than unix timestamps
because I can type the hour there if I forget to mark it.</p>
<p>The system benefits from not needing a locale to parse dates.
If you don't like english dates, you can use ISO-8601 timestamps,
those should work as well and look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-11-21T20:16:49+00:00</code></pre>
<h2>task/start and task/stop</h2>
<p>To start a task you write a timestamp into a file and mark it to start the task.
Although it'd be easy to do it manually,
I add few convenience scripts so you don't lose an entry
just because you write &gt; instead of &gt;&gt;.
Here's task/start and task/stop.
They are used to mark a task completed or start a task.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo start: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }
</code><code>
</code><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo stop: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }</code></pre>
<p>You can consider these are up to you to configure,
they're for your convenience.</p>
<h2>task/span</h2>
<p>Next you need a tool to know task status. Here's the 'task/span':</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>if (~ $#* 1) {
</code><code>  if (test -f $1) {
</code><code>    rfork e
</code><code>    taskname=$1
</code><code>    start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    if (~ $stop '') stop=`{date | xargs seconds}
</code><code>
</code><code>    dt=`{echo print $stop(1) - $start(1) | bc}
</code><code>    s=`{echo print $dt % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    m=`{echo print $dt / 60 % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    h=`{echo print $dt / 3600 | bc}
</code><code>    echo span: $h hours $m minutes $s seconds
</code><code>    }
</code><code>  if not { echo not a file: $1&gt;[1=2]; exit usage }
</code><code>  }
</code><code>if not { echo usage: $0 taskfile &gt;[1=2]; exit usage }</code></pre>
<p>It presents how many hours, minutes, seconds have been spent in the task.
If the task is still running, it uses the current time as range.</p>
<h2>task/report</h2>
<p>The 'task/report' sorts the tasks and builds a report out of them.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>tasks=`{for (t in $*) {
</code><code>  p=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' $t | xargs seconds}
</code><code>  echo $p $t } | sort -n | awk '{ print $2 }'}
</code><code>
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  span=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5 }'}
</code><code>  start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  if (~ $stop '') { echo $span $start '*' }
</code><code>  if not { echo $span $start }
</code><code>  sed '/^start:|^stop:/d' $taskname | sed 's/^/  /g'
</code><code>  }
</code><code>
</code><code>total=0
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  d=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$4 }'}
</code><code>  total=`{echo print $total + ($d(1) '*' 60) + $d(2) | bc}
</code><code>}
</code><code>echo total: `{echo print $total / 60 | bc} hours `{echo print $total % 60 | bc} minutes</code></pre>
<p>When a task is ongoing, this utility shows a star on it's entry.
This script could be customized for different uses.
Right now it's a plaintext report.</p>
<h2>display</h2>
<p>Some people like to have a display that tracks what is going on.
The 'task/track' -script executes a command periodically every minute
and the window where it runs is cleaned every time it repeats.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>while (sleep 60) task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt; /dev/text</code></pre>
<p>It again is merely a convenience.
All of this functionality composes with rest of what the system has to offer.
For instance if you want to see all tasks in some directory:</p>
<pre><code>while (sleep 1) {
</code><code>    echo -n &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>    for (x in *.task) {
</code><code>        echo -n $x: ' '
</code><code>        task/span $x }}</code></pre>
<p>Also here's a cool thing,
if you want completed task list to appear when you log into your terminal,
you can add this into the rio start script:</p>
<pre><code>window -r 2338 15 2853 345 task/track 'echo *.task'</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we're done now. Here's how the finished program looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="task screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.png"></p>
<h2>tally</h2>
<p>The whole program suite is 48 lines and 1.5kB.</p>
<pre><code>cpu% wc bin/rc/task/*
</code><code> 21     119     703 bin/rc/task/report
</code><code> 18     100     578 bin/rc/task/span
</code><code>  3      11      73 bin/rc/task/start
</code><code>  3      11      72 bin/rc/task/stop
</code><code>  3      15     100 bin/rc/task/track
</code><code> 48     256    1526 total</code></pre>
<p>This is about 85 times less than kapow punch clock.</p>
<h2>apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>It may seem the comparison is unfair.
Are the programs equivalent in functionality?
The answer is no.
The 'task' implements much less functionality than the kapow punch clock.
It's barely considered bunch of scripts.
However the tasks are merely files and you edit them with existing tools,
this thing introduces very little to learn.
The manual is 1kB and I think I made it verbose.
Yet despite that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're able to search from your tasks.</li>
<li>Exporting/Importing of tasks is easy because they are files
and to use the program you have to know where they are.</li>
<li>Tasks can be interleaved with other contents on the system.</li>
<li>Tasks archive properly given your other files archive properly.</li>
<li>You can attach and receive tasks in the mail.</li>
<li>The status of the tasklist can be securely live-displayed
on a remote info board and shared with collaborators.</li>
<li>There are lots of customization options.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder what the take-away from here is.
Despite this all, kapow punch clock, it's fine software.
I don't mind that it's been written.</p>
<h2>experiences</h2>
<p>I did this to try off this 'rc' and try to write a manual page.
I'm surprised how usable the 'troff' is once you don't assume it should be something familiar.
The 'rc' is equally incredible by having an actual structure that you can rely on.
Plan 9 is such an incredibly good operating system,
I constantly find things that surprise in a good way.</p>

<p>I would download and save assets, bookmark libraries, save articles and tutorials. Anything that could help me with doing a better job.</p>
<p>I thought I was being resourceful, but I think it came from a place of fear. I wasn’t confident in my skills and would collect anything that might help compensate for that. I don’t think it did.</p>
<p>I don’t remember a single time when was able to solve a problem at work by digging into my collection of resources.</p>
<p>What did help was building things and getting more practice under my belt. Every time I solved a new problem, it gave me a mental model to approach a category of similar problems. (See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern matching</a>)</p>
<p>The more I practiced, the better I got at pattern matching. And more importantly, I grew more confident in my ability to solve new problems that I haven’t come across yet.</p>
<p>Now with a few years under my belt, I’ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuZeff2y32M">declared bankruptcy</a> on my reading list and open tabs. I still read a lot, I just don’t read an article that isn’t relevant to the work I’m doing right now, and I most definitely don’t save it for later.</p>

<p>Know less, do more.</p>

What seems like productive reading time in the morning reverted back to mindless commutes between work and home. I can relate and in november, this is my attempt to get back to my reading habits every single day.</p>

<p>Back in my previous article <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-07-20-articles-of-july/">Want to improve?

<p>For all developers whom are looking for direct alternatives to google’s tools. it is interesting to see the extent of inconvenience this community of non-googlers would go just not to use google. Privacy definitely has its importance; all the more paramount when its used in your disfavour.</p>

<p>The more time you spent building your product, your own furniture, or even your software will create this irrational love for it. Some call it the ikea effect where furnitures build by your own hands seems to have more worth than it actually has - an addition of sentimental worth.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s often effort that ultimately creates long-term satisfaction,” wrote Dan Ariely wrote in his book&nbsp;The Upside of Irrationality, after co-authoring the Ikea effect paper. “Greater labor leads to greater love.”</p>

<p>While it is not entirely true, there are some good pointers to take away from this article. Coincidentally, I agree with point 2,4,6,8,10. A good design makes a product understandable. The design is supposed to make the product self explanatory. The classical example is how a 3 year old was able to understand how to use an iphone without any manual or explanation. That is a ton of genius packed into one small device.</p>

<p>It is interesting how things that we take for granted are actually a solution to challenging problems that were faced by the previous generations. While it is a story back into history, here is a quote from John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“What industries badly need is a universal way to communicate documents across a wide variety of machine configurations, operating systems and communication networks. These documents should be viewable on any display and should be printable on any modern printers. If this problem can be solved, then the fundamental way people work will change.”  — John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe</p>

While Apple is talking about saving the earth by producing less electronic waste, I would hope to see how they are backing up their attempts with statistics.

<p>Rather than to fight the slow fight to convince others to drive less and thus have less cars on the road, how about a radical alternative?</p>

<p>Give them an pleasant alternative, escooters. This can help to cover short distance travels, it also help us to see how the government can chart the way for a societal change in lifestyle. A step forward for countries to reduce in carbon footprint is to create bicycle lanes to encourage more bicycle as preferred mode of transport.</p>

<p>Give them space and time to work, free from distractions. Work from home’s top distractions are actually the consistent messages that keeps coming in while being physically around your coworkers.</p>

<p>Work from home allows you the socially acceptable approach to mute your employees so you can focus on the tasks before you. While WFH heightens the room for productivity, people are feeling more lonely than before.</p>

<p>The disconnection with their coworkers can also affect their productivity as their mental wellness can be affected with prolong isolation. Companies however feels that it is personal employee responsibility to get themselves connected. Essentially, while it is true to a large extent, companies can play its part to setup itself up for success; not by luck but by design. This includes digital engagements, interactive digital townhall, more frequent get togethers once in a while to bring people together.</p>

<p>The two LBs route requests based on different critierias across the different layers of OSI layer. Network assumes availability as long as there is a successful TCP ping to the resource; regardless of the content of the pong response. App LB allows you to validate the content of the response to be correct.</p>

<p>Very good short snippet to understand the different use-cases.</p>

<p>It is your experiences and achievements that shows how good a programmer you are. Flush those out. Don’t go flashing your education status when that truthfully does not reflect the strength of a programmer. You can be book smart but not a good programmer with a long history of writing bad code. Get that sorted out.</p>

<p>The secret to serving static video content is to use CDNs.<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">This</a> is a simple description of what is a CDN. This might be my an interesting topic to delve deeper to explore the science behind this magic.</p>

<p>Some of the CDNs includes Limelight, Level 3, Akamai, CloudFront, and CloudFlare. For Netflix, they created their own CDN call <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/">Open Connect</a>. This is definitely another tool to explore.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how Netflix uses the client to determine the *best CDN to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API signals that the content this person is trying to watch is on, say, 10 different CDN servers.</li>
<li>The client intelligence picks the CDN that it calculates to be best*</li>
<li>The client intelligence continually probes to find the best way of receiving content</li>

A short glimpse into what pet vs cattle systems are. The definitions based on the post has accurately described them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cattle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can go down whenever, however. But they are always creating new server applications to ensure that the service is online.</p>

<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>Reading has this compounding effect with tangible effects budding months or even years of consistent practice. In technology, while it is easy to just chase the work and code, one of the most fundamental habits of x10 engineers is the habit of reading and immersing themselves in tech talks and discussions. May us all engineers develop this habit and make the world a better place; one piece of code at a time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've validated your micro-SaaS idea and are ready to start building the product.</p><p>The obvious next questions are</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Which features should the product include in its first version?</li><li>How long should you take to build it?</li></ol><p>Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.</p><p>Before jumping into MLP, let's first understand what MVP&nbsp;is and why it's not enough in today's times.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a> popularized the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> in his book <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.</p><h4>When MVP still works</h4><p>MVP is not dead though. It still works, given the right kind of problem statements.</p><p>Suppose you're building something that simply doesn't exist in the world, and it's something that people really want and have no alternative to getting it except from you.</p><p>At this time, people will accept a textbook MVP, simply because they have no frame of reference to compare it with. Or better yet, because they have no alternative to replace your MVP with.</p><h4>Why MVP&nbsp;is not enough in 2021</h4><p>Over the past few years as smartphone penetration boomed, products matured, product design and user experience matured, people's expectations have increased.</p><p>No longer does a quickly thrown together prototype cut it. People expect a minimum level of good UX and ease-of-use, else they'll leave your app before even giving it a proper try.</p><p>In fact, in 2021 great UX might be one strong reason people pick your product over incumbents. That's what happened with <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">Transistor.fm</a>, who made podcast hosting simple and easy.</p><p>People expect good aesthetics that make a first impression, simply because that's what they have become used to from the plethora of beautiful and well-designed apps out there in the world.</p><p>People expect products to be fully functional as advertised. Buggy products are not acceptable, and in fact people might quickly take to Twitter or social media to let others know that a product is unreliable.</p><p>The MVP mindset intensely focuses on building the bare minimum, and that often leaves users frustrated and drives them to seek alternative solutions. Stiffer competition means that people WILL compare your product to alternatives in the market, it's inevitable. And unless you provide something unique and valuable that nobody else does, people are likely to leave.</p><p>All these reasons and more make MVP&nbsp;a dated concept, especially in the context of SaaS products. But above all, I think the MVP mindset makes product builders think too heavily about the "minimum" and often so at the cost of "viable".</p><p>That's a common pitfall and to avoid that, I propose the MLP framework.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)?</h2><p>A great new concept that I've fallen in love with and personally follow in every product I build is MLP, or Minimum Loveable Product.</p><p>The term MLP was first coined by Brian de Haaff, the co-founder of Aha!, in his book <a href="https://www.aha.io/lovability" target="_blank">Lovability</a>.</p><p>Its definition is an extension of what Eric Ries already introduced to the world with MVP. With MLP though, you are trying to build the minimum "loveable" product, with a focus on no matter how small or feature-stripped the first version of your product is, it is sufficient to deliver a delightful experience to your user.</p><h4>Minimum Viable Product and the burnt pizza analogy</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaona/" target="_blank">Jiaona Zhang</a>, who is currently VP&nbsp;of Product at Webflow (this blog is built using Webflow) introduced the <a href="https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/" target="_blank">burnt pizza analogy</a> to her students at Stanford.</p><p>“<em>Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.</em>"</p><p>A great practical example of Minimum Loveable Product is the Apple iPad. All the tablets that came before Apple's tablet were MVPs.</p><h2>MLP vs MVP</h2><p>If you're new to all these terminologies, I understand that it can be confusing. Bear with me, you'll wrap your head around it soon enough.</p><p>Build an MLP when you are solving a problem that's already understood by people, and an MVP when people don't easily understand a problem.</p><p>Build an MLP when you can clearly define and understand a market and you are trying to stand out from the existing tools. Build an MVP when you're trying to gauge if there even exists a market to serve.</p><p>An&nbsp;MLP can be built when you know exactly what customers want. An MVP is when you don't know what customers want, and therefore you want to throw things at the wall as quickly as possible and see what sticks.</p><p>An MLP is necessary if you are building in a market where several large and well-known alternatives already exist. An MVP is the right approach for a new market with barely any alternatives, or those solutions are not yet known by the masses.</p><p>While building an MLP, you make a dedicated effort to succeed with that idea. With MVP, you are trying to determine quickly whether the idea can succeed or whether it will fail.</p><p>Building an&nbsp;MVP means you're ready for failure and also ready to pivot quickly as you learn more about the market. Which means you should make tech and architecture decisions that help you move fast above anything else. Scalability or good architecture design is a concern to pay attention to while building an MLP.</p><p>Finally, the end goal of an MLP is that the customers who use it find it sufficient in functionality and experience to be able to "love" it. With an MLP, you're building just enough that a customer with (hopefully) a real pain point would "tolerate" and continue using your product while you validate your assumptions.</p><h2>Minimum Marketable Product, Minimum Remarkable Product, Minimum Launchable Product</h2><p>The what?</p><p>I know, I know. I came across these terms for the first time today while researching to write this post. And I went through the literature so that I can tell you to safely ignore it.</p><p>If you understand and embody the concept of MLP, you don't need to think about any other frameworks or terminologies that you may discover while researching on Google.</p><h2>How to build an MLP for your Micro SaaS idea</h2><p>Alright, let's put aside theory and dive right in.</p><p>Here are the steps you should loosely follow to building an MLP.</p><h4>1. Understand the #1 problem you're trying to solve</h4><p>What's the #1 reason someone would want to use your Micro SaaS product over existing alternatives?</p><p>Is it that existing options have poor UX?&nbsp;Great, create a well designed and easy-to-use product. You'd be surprised to know how often people switch to an easier to use tool, simply because they are fed up of the poor UX that they encounter repeatedly.</p><p>Is it that existing alternatives are very expensive?&nbsp;Carve out a minimum set of features that people are paying a lot of money for and charge 1/10th for your v1 product. This might not work for very large customers, but vast majority of customers who are small or mid-sized are always looking for affordable alternatives.</p><p>It might not just be raw quantum of pricing, but certain companies targeting Enterprise customers have very complicated pricing slabs and tiers that are designed to give their sales person more room. In such a case, coming out with a competitor product which has a simple, easy-to-understand pricing is how you attract customers.</p><p>Are existing alternatives lacking certain features that leaves a subset of users very dissatisfied?&nbsp;Great, your MLP should specifically address that problem by building functionality that attracts these dissatisfied users. Side note - This is perhaps one of the best ways to go about building a new product.</p><p>In all cases, it involves understanding the problem you are solving and the exact reason why someone would use your product.</p><h4>2. Design a simple product that solves the top customer needs satisfactorily</h4><p>Once you have identified the #1 reason, it's time to decide on a feature set for your product that solves your customer's top pain points satisfactorily.</p><p><strong>Let's take an example</strong> - People want to add a feedback tracking tool inside their product, so that they can collect user feedback automatically. However, the existing solutions don't allow them to embed the feedback tracker within their tool.</p><p>That's your entry point into providing value that customers seek, but are not getting as of today.</p><p>Having understood the #1 problem, you also have to understand other requirements that fall under the "minimum" set of things you need to do to build a "loveable" product.</p><p>These could be:</p><ul role="list"><li>existing solutions are all well designed and aesthetically pleasing =&gt;&nbsp;your minimum loveable product needs to be well designed too</li><li>existing solutions are affordably priced with a easy to understand pricing structure =&gt; your MLP also needs a simple pricing structure that's affordable</li></ul><p>In general, you want to analyze your competitors and understand </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>What they are doing well</li><li>What users value from among those things</li></ol><p>In your MLP, you need to cover the intersection of (what they are doing well) x (what users value from among those).</p><h4>3. Set a short timeline for building your MLP</h4><p>No matter what you build, building in isolation for too long is dangerous. The main reason for that is - you get to know too late whether your assumptions about what the user really values are on point or off course.</p><p><strong>"But Preetam, you just told me to build a Minimum Loveable Product. And now you're saying I got to build it quickly?"</strong></p><p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>Short timeframe depends on what you are building, and the size of your team.</p><p>For example - with SuperLemon (WhatsApp plugin for Shopify), Sankalp and I built a MLP in 2 weeks time.</p><p>How?</p><p>We identified precisely the way we could do better - …</p></div></div>

<h2>C++ Vector</h2>
<p>A <b>vector</b> is a sequence container implementing array that can change in size. Unlike array, the size of a vector changes automatically when elements are appended or deleted. </p>
<p>Vector stores elements in contiguous memory location which enables direct access of any elements using <span>operator []</span>. To support shrink and expand functionality at runtime, vector container may allocate some extra storage. Hence, compared to array, vector requires more memory and in return it manage memory dynamically and efficiently.</p>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on November 21, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25174048">Hacker News discussion.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This week's post is about Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">Statistical data binning</a> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>Adding new data to a sorted list with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module is to allow you to efficiently search and
update sorted lists. To this end, it provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>An "insert" -- as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a> -- implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">statistical data binning</a>, you have data that you want to group into "bins". E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have data on different fruits and want to group "lemon" and "orange" into
"citrus".</li>
<li>You have data on students' grades and want to group scores between 80 and 90
into "B", scores between 90 and 100 into "A", etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to write a function that computes the bin.
E.g., binning fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_fruit(fruit):
    if fruit in ["lemon", "orange"]:
        return "citrus"
    elif fruit in ["apple", "pear"]:
        return "malinae"


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'pear']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>E.g., turning test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_score(score):
    if 90 &lt;= score &lt;= 100:
        return "A"
    elif 80 &lt;= score &lt; 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 &lt;= score &lt; 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 &lt;= score &lt; 70:
        return "D"
    elif score &lt; 60:
        return "F"


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[78, 87, 93, 78, 53, 92, 64, 70, 75, 60]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'F', 'A', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'D']
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time
complexity</a> of this approach tends to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>m</var><var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because binning one record takes O(<var>m</var>) time -- O(<var>m</var>)
if-statements are checked -- and <var>n</var> records need to be binned.</p>
<p>If the number of bins <var>m</var> is constant, then the overall time
complexity is simply O(<var>n</var>).</p>
<p>But what if the number of bins <var>m</var> is large enough that the
straightforward approach is too slow?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">discrete data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a>. E.g., binning
fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bins = {
    "lemon": "citrus",
    "orange": "citrus",
    "apple": "malinae",
    "pear": "malinae",
}

def bin_fruit(fruit):
    return bins[fruit]


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'pear',
 'lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'pear',
 'apple']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(1) time -- regardless of the number of
bins <var>m</var> -- because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a> are implemented using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>. And creating the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> take O(<var>m</var>) time --
one entry for each bin. Thus, the overall time complexity, for <var>n</var>
records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">continuous data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>. E.g., turning
test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>score_bins = [60, 70, 80, 90]
score_letters = ["F", "D", "C", "B", "A"]

import bisect


def bin_score(score):
    i = bisect.bisect(score_bins, score)
    return score_letters[i]


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[60, 100, 88, 98, 55, 52, 52, 94, 71, 85]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['D', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'A', 'C', 'B']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(logÂ&nbsp;<var>m</var>) time, because
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> to navigate <code>score_bins</code>. And
creating <code>score_bins</code> takes O(<var>m</var>) time. Thus, the overall time
complexity, for <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var> log <var>m</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are able to use 3rd-party libraries, such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> or
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, then look at these functions: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html">numpy.digitize</a>,
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html#numpy.searchsorted">numpy.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.searchsorted.html">pandas.Series.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.qcut.html#pandas.qcut">pandas.qcut</a>,
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.cut.html">pandas.cut</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this scenario, you have a sorted list of data and you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic">order statistics</a> (e.g. compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a>).</li>
<li>Add new data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can imagine having a temperature sensor that regularly reports
the temperature. You want to regularly report the median temperature, as well
as be able to incorporate new temperature data as it arrives.</p>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types">list.append</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median">statistics.median</a>. E.g., monitoring temperatures:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)


def median(data):
    return statistics.median(data)


import random
import statistics

data = [random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>94.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95, 97]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>95
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(<var>n</var>) or O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) --
depending on how the median is computed.</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(1).</li>
</ul>
<p>So if the workload requires frequently adding new data and infrequently
computing the median, this approach works well.</p>
<p>But what if the workload is inverted? For example, if temperature measurements
are received every couple of minutes, but the median must be computed every
couple of seconds.</p>
<p>In that scenario, I think we would be better suited by speeding up computing
the median, even at the expense of slowing down adding new data.</p>
<p>Computing order statistics can be done in O(1) time if the data is already
sorted. So a straightforward way to handle this workload would be to sort the
data after appending and use the fact that the data is sorted to efficiently
compute the median:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)
    data.sort()


def median(data):
    n = len(data)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (data[(n // 2) - 1] + data[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        return data[n // 2]


import random

data = sorted(random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10))
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>96.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>97
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(1).</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> for adding new data can further be
improved by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>, which runs in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's Python code that does that:</p>
<pre><code>import bisect


def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    bisect.insort(data, temperature)
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this changes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of adding new data from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module for
statistical data binning and adding new data to sorted lists.</p>
<p>For further reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms that process input piece-by-piece -- like the temperature sensor
scenario -- are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithms</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> can be used to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Insertion sort</a>. Insertion
sort is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithm</a> and -- along with Python's built-in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">timsort</a> -- is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort">adaptive sorting algorithm</a> because it takes
advantage of data that is partially sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module provides "left"- and "right"-variants of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort_left">bisect.insort_left</a>,

<p>Read the documentation and figure out what the difference between the "left"-

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>Some days back I assembled a top of the line(ish) workstation for working on hobby projects and gaming. I bought the latest and greatest processor (Ryzen 3900x - 12 Core 24 Threads) from AMD and 32 GB of RAM for a no-compromises experience. I assembled the PC and it was blazing fast. I configured the system to run Windows and Linux (PopOS) using dual booting. I already had an SSD from a previous build that had the Linux OS installed and configured. I had my Twitter crawls set up on it and other services set up and working on it. I used Linux for Productivity and Windows mostly gaming as is the custom.</p>

<p>After some time, I realized this arrangement came with a very obvious drawback. Whenever I used to game, my Twitter crawls and other services in Linux, were effectively shut down. To solve this issue, I changed the boot order to set the Linux OS to boot by default. Even then, I wasn’t ready to accept this tradeoff when I had a processor that was more than capable of handling both of these OSes at the same time. If I were to somehow manage, to virtualize the existing Linux installation I had, the CPU I bought wouldn’t even break sweat handling both my OSes at the same time. I am also lazy and found it very hard to switch off a running OS and switch to the other one frequently. I just wanted to reduce my overhead.</p>

<p>So summarizing the above, I wanted to boot the already existing Linux installation I had on a different SSD as a guest VM in windows. I already had a Windows 10 Professional version so, the choice of hypervisor was easy, as this particular version of Windows comes with Hyper-V. The challenge here is booting from an actual hard disk instead of a virtual hard disk. The problems with the above approach are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Passthrough the hard disk (having Linux installation) directly to the VM</li>
  <li>Boot from this hard disk by using virtualized GRUB media</li>
  <li>Solve other issues for smooth operation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enabling-virtualization-and-hyperv">Enabling virtualization and HyperV</h2>

<p>The first step in this process is to activate Virtualization features from the BIOS and enable it in Windows. In my case, it was a simple setting in BIOS called Secure Virtual Machine Mode (SVM) which when enabled allows you to use HyperV in Windows. Enabling HyperV in Windows is then straight forward. Follow the below steps to activate HyperV.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search Windows Features in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>Click the checkbox near Hyper-V. Press OK and you should be done.</li>
  <li>Windows will restart once to enable this feature.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/enableHV.PNG" alt="EnableHyperV"></p>

<h2 id="passing-through-the-ssd-to-vm">Passing through the SSD to VM</h2>
<p>The next challenge here is to make sure the actual media (SSD in my case) is passed through without interference to the VM we create. You have to make sure Windows is not using this media and forwards it cleanly to our target VM.</p>
<h3 id="make-the-device-offline-in-windows">Make the device offline in Windows</h3>
<p>To make sure that the media we are passing to the new VM is not being used by the host OS, we need to make sure the disk is offline. You can do that by doing the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Disk Management tool by searching for it in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>All your disks should appear at the bottom along with all the partitions in the bottom.</li>
  <li>Go to the Linux media you want to forward (the drive which has Linux installed on it) and left-click on it. You’ll get an option to make this device offline, click on it. Now the disk should be offline and the UI should be reflecting the change.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/offlineHDD.PNG" alt="offlineHDD"></p>

<h3 id="create-a-vm-using-hyperv">Create a VM using HyperV</h3>
<p>Once you complete the above step, you need to create a VM using HyperV. Go to HyperV Manager and create a new VM. Create a new VM with all the necessary configurations like memory and CPU cores. While creating a new VM make sure that you select generation 2 (No specific reason just seems newer and better suited to me) in the Specify Generation section and in the Connect Virtual Hard disk section select the “Attach a Virtual Hard disk later” option. Once you do that your VM should be created. To mount our Linux media and make sure we can boot to it we need to do a device passthrough to the VM.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the settings of the newly created VM, under the SCSI controller section you need to add a Hard disk.</li>
  <li>In the media section your Linux HDD should show up under the Physical Hard disk section. Select the Hard disk and click apply.</li>
  <li>Mount any other disks if needed.</li>
  <li>Download the SuperGrub 2 disk image from <a href="https://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/">here</a></li>
  <li>In the DVD drive under the SCSI section select the recently downloaded ISO as an image file. 
<img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/HDD.PNG" alt="VMHDDConfiguration"></li>
</ol>

<p>SuperGrub2 helps us to solve the issue of not finding the GRUB partition as we are booting in a VM. We use SuperGrub2 to boot into our Linux install.</p>

<p>Once you are done, keep the DVD drive boot priority highest.</p>

<h2 id="disable-snapshots">Disable Snapshots</h2>

<p>HyperV won’t allow you to boot the created VM as the HyperV Manager cannot create a snapshot. This is because our installation media is an actual HDD instead of a virtual one. You can disable Snapshotting by going to the VM settings -&gt; Management -&gt; Checkpoints and deselect the “Enable Checkpoints” check box.</p>

<h2 id="boot-into-the-linux-vm">Boot into the Linux VM</h2>

<p>Once you are done with the above steps you can spin up the VM and you should be able to boot into the SuperGrub Menu. In this menu select the “Detect and show boot methods” entry.</p>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/dualbootasVM/imagesgrub.PNG" alt="superGrub"></p>

<p>You should then be able to select your Linux version and be able to boot into it.</p>

<h2 id="configure-the-display-driver">Configure the display driver</h2>
<p>If you were using Nvidia proprietary drivers on the existing Linux installation you’ll need to remove them. Once you do that you need to install the xserver-xorg-video-fbdev package to make xorg server work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>xserver-xorg-video-fbdev 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added an x11 configuration file which might or might not have helped. Adding it just in case this might help someone. Create a new file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-hyperv.conf and add the below snippet to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Section <span>"Device"</span>
 Identifier <span>"HYPER_V Framebuffer"</span>
 Driver <span>"fbdev"</span>
EndSection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I wasn’t able to boot into the GUI (though CLI is still accessible) without the above fixes. Once you do that and reboot you should be able to boot into the Linux GUI.</p>



<p>Congratulations! you now have a Virtualized version of your Linux Installation which can be accessed inside your Windows OS. The advantage of this approach is you can still normally boot into the Linux OS and all your changes are consistent across both VM and the actual Linux system as the media is the same. The only problem I can see is enabling GPU drivers. In the future maybe I can dynamically switch the display drivers based on the context.</p>

<p>This method also won’t work if your Linux install exists on the same Hard disk. I feel in that case just converting the whole partition to a VHDX file would be easier. This method has its own drawbacks like the data won’t be consistent across both instances.</p>

					<div><p>PASK – Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards – is an international movement committed to achieving change in relation to piano keyboard size.</p><p>Specifically, PASK aims to convince piano manufacturers to begin producing piano keyboards in three standard sizes. Purchasers of new pianos will then have a choice of keyboard size. In addition to the current ‘large’ size, we need two additional sizes with <u>narrower keys</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The current piano keyboard has prevailed since the 1880’s and was not designed for the physical capabilities of the population at large. It has been assumed that the current size is suitable for all, whereas in fact it is isn’t. The keys are too wide for the majority of pianists, considering men, women and children of all nationalities and across all age groups.</p><p>The current keyboard size and key width suits people with large hands, generally adult males with average to above average spans. However, for those with smaller hands, today’s piano increases technical difficulties and learning time. It limits musical expression and prevents access to a large amount of the piano repertoire. Worst of all, it can cause debilitating pain and injury.</p><p>A simple analogy illustrates the point. Does it make sense that all men in an athletics race should have to wear the same size shoes? And that female athletes have to run in the same size shoes as the men? And that children have to run in the same size shoes as adults?</p></div>

					<div><p>The<strong> long term goal of PASK </strong>is for acoustic and digital piano manufacturers to offer a choice of three standard keyboard sizes in accordance with the DS standards. These are: DS5.5® (7/8) and the DS6.0® (15/16) as well as the current ‘large’ DS6.5<em>&nbsp;</em>keyboard. They need to be&nbsp;mass-produced and marketed worldwide in such a way that the new alternative sizes are readily available and naturally accepted options for all pianists and teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>For this to happen, we need to focus on both building the demand from the piano world as well as encouraging supply from manufacturers. Clearly, these are interdependent.&nbsp;</p><p>Pianists with smaller hands must create a united voice and demand access to keyboards with narrower keys. Piano teachers, universities and conservatoriums need to recognise their benefits. Competitions and concert venues should provide a choice of keyboard for performers.</p><p>Alternatively sized keyboards are currently only available from a limited number of sources, are expensive and often involve long wait times for customers. The major piano manufacturers need to take up this challenge.&nbsp;A key factor in creating change will be public support from prominent pianists, academics and teachers around the world.</p><p>There are three main strategies required to achieve this goal:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising awareness of the benefits of reduced size keyboards for those with smaller hands.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating opportunities for pianists to experience the difference in playing on narrower keys.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaking down barriers and resistance to change.</p></div>

					<p>PASK is not a formally constituted organisation, but a network of people working towards a common goal.

There are three founders of PASK:

Ms Erica Booker from Sydney, Australia – Graduate of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, pianist and piano teacher. Erica is also a Suzuki teacher trainer and leading advocate for alternatively sized piano keyboards:<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/%E2%80%8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ericabookerpiano.com</a>

Dr Carol Leone from Dallas, Texas – Chair of Keyboard Studies at SMU Meadows School of the Arts in Dallas, internationally recognized performing artist, teacher, lecturer, and author. Carol is one of the world’s leading researchers and proponents of ergonomic piano keyboards to promote a pianist’s wellness:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carolleone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.carolleone.com</a>

Ms Rhonda Boyle from Melbourne, Australia – Former government policy analyst/strategic planner with qualifications in physics, environmental science and urban planning. Rhonda is a pianist, independent researcher and author of peer-reviewed articles relating to hand size and piano playing:

<span>These three founders have no financial connections with any piano or keyboard manufacturers.</span>

The PASK network is gradually growing and now includes many others around the world who support the PASK goals and who are actively engaged in encouraging change.

					<div><p>The term ESPK (ergonomically scaled piano keyboard) is now mostly used in the academic community when referring to keyboards smaller than the current ‘standard’ size i.e., with 6.5 inch octave. The term ‘reduced-size keyboard’ has also been used in some literature. &nbsp;Also note that the DS5.5®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the ‘7/8 keyboard’ as the key widths are close to (but not exactly) 7/8 of the ‘standard’ keyboard.

(Chris Donison and David Steinbuhler pioneered the introduction of piano keyboards with narrower keys for acoustic pianos, mainly in North America.) &nbsp;The PASK movement (Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards) generally uses the term ‘alternative sizes’ to avoid confusion as ‘reduced size’ could imply fewer than 88 keys.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <p><i>4<sup>th</sup> November, 2016</i></p>

      <p>
	<q>SVG 2 is on life support.</q>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
	About a month ago the W3C's SVG staff contact person (Doug
	Schepers) relayed some very alarming news... that the SVG
	Working Group charter was not going to be renewed when it
	expired at the end of October, 2016. This was quite shocking
	as the group had worked quite hard to get the SVG 2
	specification to
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Reports"><i>Candidate
	Recommendation</i></a> status. If the charter is not renewed,
	it would mean <span>an immediate end to
	SVG 2</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
	While shocking and unexpected, it didn't come out of left field.
	The active participation in the working group has dropped to
	just a handful of people, none representing any of the browser
	vendors. In fact, the last two "face-to-face" meetings had
	attendance of just three regular participants, one from Canon
	(which is dropping membership in the W3C as the end of the year)
	and two <q>invited experts</q> who are working for free. The weekly
	teleconferences were down to four or five participants (with
	representatives from KDDI and the W3C).
      </p>

      <h2>Recent Developments</h2>

      <p>
	The working group appealed to the browser vendors for support
	in renewing the charter. A teleconference was organized with
	multiple representatives from each of the major browser
	vendors as well as a number of other interested parties
	(Adobe, Canon, KDDI, etc.). The general consensus from the
	browser vendors is that SVG 2 should be finished but that it
	should be restricted to <q>fixing</q> the problems with SVG
	1.1 2nd edition along with a few choice selected new features
	(like 'paint-order') which have already been implemented by
	multiple browsers. <span>New features
	(meshes, hatches, etc.) should be removed and pushed into
	a <a href="https://wicg.io/">WICG group</a>.</span> (Wrapped
	text was not discussed.) (See
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/10/06-svg-minutes.html">minutes</a>.)
	A resolution was made to <q>Re-charter SVG WG for one more year
	with a focus on moving SVG 2 to REC with only the features that
	have implementer experience.</q> Note that this is a WG resolution
	and not a W3C agreement to continue the group.
      </p>
      <p>
	With a focus on a limited SVG 2 specification, the W3C has
	agreed to extend the current SVG Working Group charter until the
	end of January in order to give the group a chance to sort out a
	new charter. Any new charter will focus on completing SVG 2 by
	developing a test suite and in pushing for implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
	An additional discussion by the WG was that all joint CSS/SVG
	specifications will be completely taken over by CSS. This
	includes
	<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/">Transforms</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/">Filters</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking-1/">Masking and Clipping</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/">Compositing and Blending</a>,
	etc. This completes the long process of CSS
	<span>stealing</span>
	absorbing the most interesting SVG features.
      </p>

      <h2>Future</h2>

      <p>
	The future is pretty cloudy at the moment. Here are some observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There are only two browser implementations of importance:
	    Blink (Chrome/Opera) and Gecko (Firefox). Of these, only
	    Blink has the resources to fully implement new features
	    quickly although Gecko has implemented more of SVG
	    2. Chrome commands a huge lead in browser market share
	    (almost 75%). Google has a habit of unilaterally removing
	    features it doesn't like from Blink, basically dictating
	    that those features are removed from specifications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two other significant browser implementations, WebKit
	    (Safari) and Edge, are more followers than leaders and
	    have relatively little market share (5% and 4%
	    respectively).  For example, Microsoft explicitly stated
	    that they would not even look at SVG 2 until the
	    specification was a Candidate Recommendation (while the
	    other browser vendors have implemented a limited set of
	    SVG 2 features such as 'paint-order', see
	    <a href="https://nikosandronikos.github.io/svg2-info/svg2-feature-support/">SVG
	    2 Feature Support</a> for current status of SVG 2
	    implementation).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There seems to be a disconnect between the browser vendors
	    and the content creators. Even Adobe has expressed
	    frustrations with the current status (and they have
	    significantly reduced their involvement with W3C as a
	    result).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Moving things into a WICG is not a viable strategy.
	    Without browser vendor buy-in, things are likely to never
	    emerge from a WICG group. In addition, a WICG group is
	    intended to develop new ideas to the point where the
	    browser vendors can have a look at them. Both meshes and
	    hatches are already well developed with Inkscape
	    supporting full rendering for several years. (Note that
	    the browsers already have code to render meshes as they
	    all support meshes in PDF.)
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Despite the large turnout for the SVG WG meeting where we
	    discussed the future of SVG 2, we have received almost no
	    feedback (after requesting it several times) from the
	    browser vendors on which SVG 2 features they are likely to
	    implement. This seems to be indicative of the low interest
	    they have in implementing SVG 2.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Even the CSS working group, which has a much larger active
	    participation, is having trouble getting their specifications
	    out. Both SVG and CSS seem to be <q>passé</q>. The new
	    darling of the browser vendor set is
	    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/houdini-maybe-the-most-exciting-development-in-css-youve-never-heard-of/">Houdini</a> which offers lower level
	    access to browser internals. This is not unexpected as
	    browsers continue on the path to being the new OS.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    The most important long term observation is that browser
	    vendors respond to demand. I've been told SVG would never
	    have been part of HTML5 if it wasn't for Inkscape which
	    allowed the production of tons of SVG's used in the
	    Wikipedia. Browser vendors keep track of the use of
	    various features. <span>Features with
	    more use get more attention.</span>
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What should Inkscape do?</h3>

      <p>
	Given the above observations, if we really want mesh, hatches,
	etc. to remain part of SVG 2 and to be supported by
	browsers <span>we must generate content that
	uses those features</span>; content that gets people excited
	enough to put pressure on the browser vendors to implement
	them.  We've already started to do this in a limited way by
	enabling the use of 'paint-order' which is supported by three
	of the four major browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
	Of course this means that some artwork created using Inkscape
	won't be viewable directly on the web. We should accept this
	as a necessary (and hopefully temporary) step. We can provide
	warnings in Inkscape when artists use features that are not
	widely supported. We can advise artists of work-arounds, i.e.
	converting a mesh to an internal image when exporting. And we
	can provide
	<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfills</a></q>
	that replace internal browser functionality with JavaScript
	implementations. (I've already started work on a mesh gradient
	polyfill.)
      </p>
      <p>
	I've been working on improvements to the mesh gradient
	GUI. This work has been back-ported to 0.92. We plan on
	enabling mesh gradients by default in the 0.92 release. This
	will start generating public content that uses mesh gradients.
      </p>

<strong>FreeBSD - a lesson in poor defaults</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 09/25/2020. 
<small><a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a></small>

</p><p>
This page lists some of the changes I make to a vanilla install of FreeBSD
for security hardening. Some changes to increase network performance or make
things a bit more more sane are also included. It only covers basic changes
that a sysadmin can make to a running system.

</p><p>
It could also be considered a commentary piece on the state of security in
FreeBSD's development ecosystem, highlighting their strong resistance to
change and unwillingness to replace old cruft with modern alternatives.

</p><p>
The project's
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/security.html">security page</a>
says the following:

</p><blockquote><em>
FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are constantly
working on making the operating system as secure as possible.
</em></blockquote>

<p>
But is that really true? Let's find out.

<h2 id="openssh">OpenSSH Modifications</h2>

FreeBSD has a history of making "interesting" choices with regard to the
version of OpenSSH they bundle in the base system, often deliberately going
against upstream in the name of retaining backward compatibility or to gain
perceived performance improvements. Disabling or ignoring security features
in favor of performance seems to be a recurring theme, as we'll see later on.

<p>
It is my belief that quite a few poor decisions have been made in this area.
As a primary example, they insisted on maintaining the
<a href="https://www.psc.edu/hpn-ssh">HPN-SSH</a> patchset and enabling it
by default for quite a long time.

</p><p>
You might say "Well OK, but what's actually <em>wrong</em> with those patches?"

</p><p>
OpenSSH increased the channel limits enough to support a cross-country gigabit
connection without slowdown years ago. For most users, this means that the HPN
patches are an unnecessary complexity with little or no benefit. In addition
to that, they would frequently hold FreeBSD back from updating their version
of OpenSSH because of HPN backporting and manual refactoring of the patchset.

</p><p>
Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrappers">tcp_wrappers</a>
was abandoned long ago in OpenSSH upstream, but FreeBSD still
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294328">patched it back in</a> and enabled it for everyone.

</p><p>
The same was true for weak DSA host keys, which they
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294495">switched back on</a> for compatibility with older clients.

</p><p>
FreeBSD also
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=296634">re-enabled</a>
insecure encryption ciphers in their build after they were disabled upstream,
with backward compatibility apparently being more important to them than the
security of their users.

</p><p>
If we don't deprecate insecure options bit by bit somewhere in the ecosystem,
we end up with a situation like OpenSSL. Pressure has to be applied somewhere.
One can be part of that team, or one can play against them. In this case,
FreeBSD is the team trying to increase the risk.

</p><p>
They've made local changes to their OpenSSH build and its default config files
that left their users vulnerable when other platforms were unaffected. Here's
a (possibly incomplete) list of examples:

</p><ul>

</li></ul>

<p>
A list of FreeBSD's modifications to both the code and config files can be
seen
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/crypto/openssh/FREEBSD-upgrade?view=markup#l93">here</a>
for the base system (possibly outdated/unmaintained) and 
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/openssh-portable/files">here</a>
for the ports version.

</p><p>
Thankfully, as hinted above, it's fairly easy to install OpenSSH from ports
with all the FreeBSDisms removed. Their
<a href="https://www.freshports.org/security/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>
port has a hefty set of options you can toggle:

</p><pre>BLACKLISTD      FreeBSD blacklistd(8) support
BSM             OpenBSM Auditing
DOCS            Build and/or install documentation
FIDO_U2F        FIDO/U2F support (security/libfido2)
HPN             HPN-SSH patch
KERB_GSSAPI     Kerberos/GSSAPI patch (req: GSSAPI)
LDNS            SSHFP/LDNS support
LIBEDIT         Command line editing via libedit
NONECIPHER      NONE Cipher support
PAM             Pluggable authentication module support
TCP_WRAPPERS    tcp_wrappers support
XMSS            XMSS key support (experimental)
MIT             MIT Kerberos (security/krb5)
HEIMDAL         Heimdal Kerberos (security/heimdal)
HEIMDAL_BASE    Heimdal Kerberos (base)
</pre>

<p>
Besides the modifications mentioned above, two other patches in particular
have been popular with FreeBSD users: threaded AES-CTR and the "NONE" cipher.

</p><p>
Threaded AES-CTR, as the name might imply, introduces threads to the code.
OpenSSH developerss have publicly said threads are too risky and won't be
added. What's more, it's largely obsoleted by AES-NI in modern CPUs and the
fact that ChaCha20-Poly1305 (the current default cipher) is even faster
when taking the message authentication code (MAC) into consideration.

</p><p>
The NONE cipher is somewhat of a misfeature, removing the encryption bits
and only keeping the data integrity. It allows users to accidentally shoot
themselves in the foot pretty easily. The trade-off in performance isn't
really worth it either, as the bottlenecks one might experience have a lot
more to do with the MAC than the actual encryption overhead.

</p><p>
I recommend disabling all of the port options. The majority of users don't
need the extra risk that any of these non-standard patches introduce.

</p><p>
As for the <code>/usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file, I would recommend
enabling only modern crypto. However, cryptography is a very complicated and
important topic, so you would be better served to research each algorithm and
come to your own conclusions instead of just taking my word. Thankfully,
upstream OpenSSH cares about security and continues to remove old, broken
algorithms as time goes on. FreeBSD can't keep patching them back in and
maintaining their backports. It's simply too much work.

</p><p>
This isn't meant to be an entire SSH tutorial, but consider changing your
default port to something other than 22 if you want less spam in your logs,
set up public keys and disable password authentication... the usual stuff.

</p><p>
The following config lines are just to revert FreeBSD's local changes that
introduce new risks:

</p><pre>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no         
UsePAM                          no 
VersionAddendum                 none  # Prevent some OS information from being
                                      # leaked by your sshd, another one of
                                      # FreeBSD's "enhancements" in both the
                                      # base system and ports version.
X11Forwarding                   no        
</pre>

<p>
In addition to improved security, using the port of OpenSSH allows you to
upgrade to newer versions much faster than waiting for a new release of the
base system. As an example, FreeBSD has comically been limited to "upgrading"
their base OpenSSH to a release that's
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=357926">three versions behind the current one at the time</a>
because of their local patches. Note that you may need further configuration
changes if using the bundled OpenSSH, as its options aren't as easily fixable.

</p><h2 id="mail">Mailer Daemon</h2>

FreeBSD includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail">Sendmail</a>
in the base system and enables it by default.

<p>
I'd like to share a quote from one of the earliest security advisories FreeBSD
ever published:

</p><blockquote><em>
The sendmail mail transfer agent has a rather poor reputation
for security related problems.  FreeBSD ships a version of
sendmail that has all known security problems fixed, but this
doesn't mean there won't be more found in the future.
</em></blockquote>

And it turns out whoever wrote that
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:03.sendmail-suggestion.asc">back in 1996</a>
wasn't wrong.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:07.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:07.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail</a>
</li></ul>

There are
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/31/Sendmail.html">many more</a>
where those came from.

<p>
Even with Sendmail's reputation, FreeBSD has kept it around and left it on
by default for all their users.

</p><p>
To make matters worse, FreeBSD sometimes imports
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=sendmail-announce&amp;m=159394546814125&amp;w=2">sendmail updates</a>
with
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=363233">no mention</a>
of the included security fixes. As you might guess, this means no advisory
is published, and most users don't get those security fixes for a long time,

</p><p>
I think most users will agree that this old program is mostly just a bother.
A full mail server, especially one that's been full of holes since the 90s,
shouldn't be in the base system at all if you ask me. Something simple for
local mail delivery should be enough.

</p><p>
I stop all the related services because it makes startup slower and I'd like
as few things running in the background as possible. The lines needed to
disable Sendmail will be in the rc.conf section later on.

</p><p>
If you actually run a mail server, there are better options like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)">Postfix</a> or
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/opensmtpd">OpenSMTPD</a>.
If you only need to send mail through a third party provider like
Gmail, <a href="https://marlam.de/msmtp/">msmtp</a> is a another
lightweight alternative. All three are in ports.

</p><h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2>

There are three firewalls included with FreeBSD: IPFW, PF, and IPFilter.
None of them are enabled by default.

<p>
I don't know anything about IPFilter, nor do I know anyone that uses it,
so we'll pretend it doesn't exist. IPFW is the native firewall.
It was written by FreeBSD, for FreeBSD, with their usual coding standards.
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:10.ipfw.asc">The</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:12.libalias.asc">result</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:13.libalias.asc">is</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:04.ipfw.asc">about</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:13.ipfw.asc">what</a>

<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:14.ipfw.asc">expect</a>.
PF is the OpenBSD firewall. It was ported from OpenBSD to FreeBSD. Which one
you use mostly comes down to preference. Since I'm more familiar with PF,
that's what I use. Unfortunately, the version of PF included with FreeBSD
hasn't been synced with upstream <strong>since 2009</strong>. Do you want
such a critical component of your OS or network device left largely
unmaintained?

</p><p>
Check the documentation for whichever firewall you decide to use for proper
configuration instructions.

</p><h2 id="portspkg">Ports and Packages</h2>

Other than just manually compiling things yourself, there are three main ways
to install software on FreeBSD:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg">pkg</a> tool (with binary packages built by the project infrastructure)
</li><li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html">ports</a> system, allowing for custom options in many applications
</li><li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere">poudriere</a>…</li></ul></div>

November 21, 2020 | http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I keep hearing about small delays in the vaccine development process that I don’t understand given how urgent the need is. I read a perfect example today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html">A New York Times article</a> sharing good news about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine mentioned that the company would be applying for emergency use authorization “within days”. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/health/Covid-moderna-vaccine.html%22">A similar article</a> cited a period of weeks for the Moderna vaccine. This progress is great news. It made me wonder, though, why not today? What prevented these companies from being ready to file with the FDA right away?</p>

<p>By all accounts, the rapid progress of COVID-19 vaccine candidates has been miraculous. Still, I’m confused by the apparent lack of urgency in certain parts of the process. Most of the vaccine development work is probably difficult to speed up. For example, it isn’t possible to speed up the rate at which trial participants get exposed to the virus so that effectiveness can be proven<sup id="fnref:hcc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hcc">1</a></sup>. But what prevents Pfizer and Moderna from pre-writing their application to the FDA while the trial is running and netting a few days or weeks? Even just a few days has serious value. Of course, the data is still coming in so there would be some uncertainty about what should be written in the application. But they must have a pretty good sense of how the trial is going. They could even pre-write two or three versions to cover the most likely scenarios. And of all possible trial outcomes, why would these companies both be unprepared for best-case scenarios where their vaccines are proving to be highly effective?</p>

<p>Getting a bit more speculative, why aren’t scientists at Pfizer and Moderna already in conversation with decision makers at the FDA so that the evaluation process can be started based on preliminary data? Then they could be possibly be ready to issue emergency use authorization immediately once the trial concludes. If there is an unexpected change in the latest data regulators should of course be prepared to reassess. To be clear, I am not suggesting that the approval process be less rigorous. I just want it happening in parallel with the trial as much as it can. Given how ridiculously destructive this pandemic is, I sure hope COVID vaccines are the FDA’s top priority.</p>

<p>This possibility reminds me of the mechanics of my thesis defense. My adviser, the main decision maker, was already very familiar with my work. Little information was actually transmitted to him that day. He already knew what he needed to know to make his decision. In fact, we wouldn’t have even gone forward with the defense if he wasn’t ready to pass me. He didn’t take a month after the defense to closely read my thesis, consider all the arguments, check the math, and then deliberate. That process occurred while the data was coming in. Maybe some parallelization of the approval process like this is happening for the COVID vaccines, but I’ve never read anything that gives the sense that it is.</p>

<h3 id="possible-answers-to-my-own-questions">Possible answers to my own questions:</h3>
<h4 id="why-werent-the-eua-applications-ready">Why weren’t the EUA applications ready?</h4>

<p>Maybe a document like this is <em>way</em> more complicated than I’m imagining and the drug companies are writing them as fast as possible. This sort of suggests that writing the application is a similar challenge to developing the vaccine. I hope that’s not right.</p>

<p>Maybe the drug companies <em>are</em> already working with the FDA, and the timing of the application isn’t important. As I mentioned above, I’ve never seen anything that suggests this.</p>

<p>Maybe these companies aren’t incentivized to actually get the vaccine to market as fast as they can. Off the bat this didn’t seem right to me, but could the advance purchase agreements that Moderna and Pfizer signed with governments eliminate their urgency?</p>

<h4 id="why-arent-the-drug-companies-working-with-the-fda">Why aren’t the drug companies working with the FDA?</h4>

<p>Maybe this just isn’t the way the FDA usually works and they weren’t able to adapt to this extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>Obviously scientific integrity is important here. Maybe the scientists are intentionally kept separate from other parts of Pfizer and from the FDA to prevent some kind of academic dishonesty. I wonder about the relative dangers involved, but I could imagine an explanation like this.</p>

<h3 id="answers-that-other-people-have-suggested">Answers that other people have suggested:</h3>

<p>Commenters on Hacker News and Reddit have suggested that the things I want to happen are already happening. I’ve looked into this a little bit, and I’m unsure. Both Moderna and Pfizer have been granted the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">Fast Track status</a>. This sounds great. It apparently means these companies have the opportunity for closer collaboration with the FDA, at least on clinical trial design. Some have suggested that the companies would also already be sharing advance results from their studies, but I haven’t found any reference saying that.</p>

<p>Fast Track also gives them the opportunity to participate in Rolling Review, which allows them to submit sections of their applications as they become ready. The references I’ve found discussing this are mostly <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization">press releases by the companies</a> or closely based on them. They discuss participation in Rolling Review in Europe and elsewhere, but I haven’t seen that they are doing this in the US.</p>

        <p><span>After Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple
        in 1985, everyone wanted to know what Steve would do
        next.... so NeXT was what he did.
        <p>
        
        In 1988 his NeXT team launched a new kind of computer for
        it's time, built on standards with a Unix core but with a
        user experience "my grandma could understand". It was well
        ahead of it's time, so naturally, it was not embraced by
        main stream consumers... a classic "Crossing the Chasm"
        issue. But many saw it for what it was, a breakthrough
        product as innovative as today's iTunes, iPod and iPhone.
        </p><p>
        
        Building upon NeXT's hardware and more importantly, their
        software development environment, many third party NeXT
        developers added their own magic dust to create
        revolutionary products, like the world's first web browser,
        or a new form of spread sheet, Lotus Improv or WebObjects,
        the foundation upon which the iTune store is built, to name
        only a few. Some of these ground breaking products may
        never be repeated. Most contained innovations embraced by
        future applications, with a clear lineage back to NeXTSTEP.
        </p><p>
        
        During the relatively short time of NeXT ascendency
        (1985-1996), Apple was bleeding red ink from repeated
        financial losses and two hugely expensive attempts to
        create a follow on Operating System. Apple's third
        president since Steve's departure, Gil Amelio saw the
        merits of Steve, his team and their technology. In December
        1996 Apple bought Next. Then the Next team took over Apple.
        The result is their hugely successful Mac OS X, built on
        the foundations of the NeXTSTEP OS.
        </p><p>
        
        While NeXT is no more, as a product or a stand alone
        company, it's impact on the industry will be felt for years
        to come. We should remember it, perhaps even study it. In
        decades to come, it will be understood as a watershed of
        innovation. Current Mac and iPhone users will be astonished
        to see how many of their beloved Mac OS X innovations had
        their roots in NeXTSTEP. There are many lessons about
        product innovation, market acceptance, and the creative
        people involved, that have yet to be uncovered.
        </p><p>
        
        This web site details part of our unique collection of NeXT
        related products and assorted items which grew up around
        NeXT Computer ecosystem, including of course NeXT hardware
        but also those rare items such as dealer sales kits, logo'd
        clothing, NeXT jewelry, banners, training tapes for
        servicing NeXT computers and printers, developer guides,
        plus third party software and hardware products.
        </p><p>
        
        While the site describes only part of the actual
        collection, the site does cover over 800 NeXT and third
        party products, many with multipage brochures and white
        papers. If you were to print all the html and PDF documents
        it would be over 3,000 pages.
        </p><p>
        
        This site describes what may well be the most extensive
        NeXT related collection available today.
        </p><p>
        
        It's history worth preserving.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8dc0160ef5e99c2bfb45abd90770b186e2eba397/318dd/img/what-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-junior-dev.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I've been a developer for over fifteen years and I've loved almost every minute of it. I can't imagine doing anything different but there are moments when I think back to starting out and how different the development landscape was, especially when it comes to learning how to code.</p>
<p>I'm really <em>not</em> that old, but things in the tech world move fast and there weren't as many resources around to help people get into frontend development and learn how to build something from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. There wasn't as many great communitys like Dev or Hashnode or WeStryve, not learning platforms such as Free Code Camp or The Odin Project.</p>
<p>So a lot of my early career felt like fumbling around for me, picking up everything I could from senior developers, hoping that they knew what they were doing, reading as many books as a I could and practicing my craft.</p>
<p>It's fair to say there were quite a few things I wish I'd known a lot earlier in my career that could have helped me progress faster or just develop both my coding skills, as well as my more complimentary skills, such as dealing with people or learning <em>how</em> to learn.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with this article I can distill what I've learned to date and share some things to watch out for and take on board to help you with your career as a frontend developer.</p>
<p><em>(Pssst -- If you like this article, come</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kendalmintcode"><em>find me on Twitter</em></a> <em>where I post regular helpful content every day)</em></p>
<h2>Start writing a blog</h2>
<p>This very blog you're reading now (whether it's on my own website or my Dev or Hashnode accounts) has grown quite popular and that's great. But I really wish I'd started much earlier and written more frequently.</p>
<p>Honestly, blogging is such a great way to cement what you've learned <em>as you're learning it</em>. You absolutely do not have to be a developer with X years in the business, nor do you have to be an expert.</p>
<p>All you need is a curios mind and to think about writing for your past self: write the article you wish you'd had on the subject.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/551d70ccb71c4ae17340ca3c67475fe0bb796b93/cc36f/img/workplace-2303851_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a bonus, if you fix something particularly tricky, you'll be able to refer back to your own article to help you solve it in the future!</p>
<p>My friend Catlin Pit has a couple of recommended articles on blogging too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/should-you-start-a-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catlin Pit's article on starting a developer blog">Should you start a blog as a developer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/how-to-start-your-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catalin Pit's article on how to start a blog">How to start a blog</a> - a common question after 'what do I write about?'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask more questions!</h2>
<p>This seems obvious, but in my experience it's really not. A lot of developers, especially those early on in their careers are easily intimidated by more experienced devs or just those that have been around longer, and this can prevent them from speaking up.</p>
<p>But you know what? That's how you learn: you ask questions, you get answers (and, back to the previous point, you now have content for a blog article!).</p>
<p>Never be afraid of asking questions, especially if you're stuck on something. There are no stupid questions, but I'm not going to lie, you will at some point come across arrogant or unhelpful people who will make you feel otherwise. My advice, ignore them and find more open and helpful people.</p>
<h2>Be honest on what you're passionate about</h2>
<p>If you love what you do and are fortunate enough to get to do that regularly, especially as a full time career then you've hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>However, I see a lot of people stuck in places and in roles that they just don't have the passion or drive for. I'm well aware that not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose, but as developers we have long held a valuable position in the job market where there are more jobs than there are developers.</p>
<p>But this is really about having a truthful discussion with your inner dev and being both honest about what you <em>really</em> enjoy doing/not doing, and realistic about how to start a role doing this.</p>
<p>For example, if you really really really don't like PHP, then take care when interviewing or seeking out roles in development agencies where WordPress is heavily featured.</p>
<p>This advice is especially true for those seeking, perhaps, their first development roles. Be honest and candid about what's right for you and (if you're able to), don't just jump at the first opportunity that comes your way.</p>
<p>The more you can discover what direction you want to travel, the better aligned you'll be down the line in your career.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, please don't put pressure on yourself to decide too early. Sometimes you have to experience what you <em>don't</em> want to know what <em>is</em> right for you.</p>
<h2>Get a coding mentor</h2>
<p>I was supremely fortunate to have worked with some amazing developers back when I started. They were experienced, knowledgable, helpful and humble and really took me under their wing. I'll never be able to thank them enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'd highly recommend getting yourself a mentor to help with your development journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f095de9a3d4e32487247b46342959b1cc2f8e9d1/3c273/img/people-2569234_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is different from a teacher or tutor (although there is overlap at the edges of the roles): a mentor is a guiding light to help give you focus and direction, to answer questions and point you along the right path for your particular journey.</p>
<p>I'd recommend taking a look at <a href="https://codingcoach.io/" title="Coding Coach website">Coding Coach</a> or my very own <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/mentorship" title="Rob Kendal coding mentorship programmes">mentorship programmes</a> to find a mentor that's right for you.</p>
<h2>Mentor others</h2>
<p>Following on from the last point, you too can be a mentor and again, you don't have to have coded for decades or be an absolute expert.</p>
<p>Think about where you are on your journey and how far you've come. Even if you're 6-8 months into learning to code, there are people only 1-2 <em>weeks</em> into theirs; these are the people you can definitely help out.</p>
<p>That said, if you <em>are</em> quite experienced, then all the more reason to help someone else who's just starting out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Become the guide you wish you'd had when you started</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's rewarding beyond measure, and a win win situation: someone getting started is helped and guided, and you learn so much in the process, believe me.</p>
<h2>You don't get what you don't ask for</h2>
<p>I'm from Yorkshire in the UK and there's a saying in this North East part of the world: Shy bairns get nowt.</p>
<p>In essence we're really saying that 'you get nothing by keeping quiet'.</p>
<p>It's easy to look at seemingly successful developers and popular Twitter personas and assume that everyone has lucky breaks and opportunity just falls from the sky.</p>
<p>To be honest, this does happen to a small number of people, but most of the successful people you'll know are a combination of trying (a lot), keeping their eyes open for opportunities and only a little sprinkle of luck.</p>
<p>Most of the time it's about asking for what you want. Now I'm not suggesting you just go kicking your boss' door in a demanding a raise, but in all seriousness, if you think you deserve a pay rise, prove it and then <em>ask for it</em>!</p>
<p>Want to switch up your career? Ask about training programs at your current workplace. Want to talk to someone on LinkedIn about their career? Ask them.</p>
<p>The worst that will happen is you get a 'no'. In which case, time to move on and try something else.</p>
<h2>Keep track of all your wins</h2>
<p>This is a big one for me. It's very easy as a human to skew towards the negative. Even if you've just launched five features on a product used by millions, I would bet that it's that single tiny error that happened that you'll be thinking about, right?!</p>
<p>I keep a notebook of little victories and compliments I've received and look through them from time to time, especially when the <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/2019-05-10-fighting-imposter-syndrome-as-a-developer" title="Fighting imposter syndrome as a developer">imposter syndrome</a> kicks in from time to time.</p>
<p>It's not about ego or vanity, but it's about celebrating your victories and remembering how far you've come.</p>
<h2>You don't have to know everything</h2>
<p>The world of deveopment is HUGE. I mean seriously almost infinite. Between languages, frameworks, patterns, platforms, frontend, backend, the list goes on.</p>
<p>When you're starting out there can be an overwhelming urge to have to know everything all at once. But I'm here to tell you that you don't need to know everything and, in reality, you can't or won't ever know it all q-- the landscape is just too vast.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3f6e59a451413441a9a9f410a3dd2bf527cf301f/b6003/img/magic-cube-1976725_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, as a frontend developer starting out, I'd recommend focussing on the three core pillars of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but once you're getting into the swing of things, start to add bits and pieces to your knowledge depending on what takes your fancy.</p>
<h2>Senior doesn't mean encylopedia</h2>
<p>Just because someone is a senior developer or an architect or principle, or has been programming for 100's of years, does not automatically make them the all knowing beasts you think they may be.</p>
<p>I'll let you into a secret: I've been developing in a fullstack fashion for over fifteen years and I still have to look up some of the most trivial snippets of code; I still miss semicolons out of things and I still make mistakes.</p>
<p>Sure, I know a lot about a lot, but there's oceans of knowledge I haven't even sailed upon. Just because people have been around the block doesn't directly equate to an infallible, all-knowing knowledge. Neither does it mean they're always automatically right or know better.</p>
<p>The point I'm driving at here is that just because you're less experienced or starting out doesn't mean your ideas are less valuable or that you have less to contribute.</p>
<p>It's also why adopting a life long approach to learning is so important as a developer.</p>
<h2>Titles don't really mean much in the long run</h2>
<p>Another thing to bear in mind is that some people get caught up in a title race and it's easy to think that becoming a 'principle developer' or 'lead architect' is the end goal. Yes, titles and recognition are nice and there's money and rewards that come with more senior titles, but they don't always reflect the abilities of the holder nor</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it's not OK to have 'become a lead developer' as a goal, but don't set your standards by the titles that you, or others, hold. It's your attitude, actions, and what you contribute to the development community that will ultimately shape your legacy.</p>
<h2>Networking is essential!!</h2>
<p>It really is <em>who you know</em> not always <em>what you know</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I'd spent more time making connections with other developers, recruiters, leaders, and makers …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As Bitcoin approaches a new price record after 3 years delay a new wave of its popularity and advertisement is expected. In such waves all the risks, downsides, pitfalls are usually hidden and the bright future is pleasantly described. I want to highlight all those dark corners and also to give my view of this field.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>As the first decentralized digital currency Bitcoin’s main purpose was to serve as a digital money service that requires no trust in a central authority, and that will be free from control. But with an extreme raise of its value it gained another purpose — as an investment asset. Current data suggests that the second purpose greatly supersedes the original one.</p>

<p>In accordance with those two purposes, we’ll consider two types of downsides and risks — technical and economical.</p>

<h3 id="technical-downsides"><strong>Technical downsides</strong></h3>

<p>Two main technical downsides of Bitcoin are inefficiency and limited scalability.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as of the time of writing, one single transaction consumes 700 kWh of energy, a huge waste. And this consumption will only increase with the growth of the network.</p>

<p>But increasing energy consumption isn’t the biggest problem since the growth of the total number of transactions is limited due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem">Bitcoin scalability problem</a>. It is estimated that the whole Bitcoin throughput can’t be more than 7 transactions per second on average. This is the dead-end for its original purpose.</p>

<p>While the absolute majority of other cryptocurrencies are useless imitators or straight-up scams, some of them indeed have slight improvements or useful extensions. It’s hard to create something perfect from the first shot, after all. Technology advancement is an evolutionary process.</p>

<p>I find this risk the most important — an emergence of a novel cryptocurrency that will contain a critical mass of improvements and extensions. Or, it could be just decent cryptocurrency, but backed by strong financial institutions (though it’s unlikely that some government will ever release a truly decentralized currency).</p>

<h3 id="economic-picture"><strong>Economic picture</strong></h3>

<p>Bitcoin proponents will argue that technical limitations are not an issue. They like to compare Bitcoin with gold, and gold isn’t transporting on the left and right. What they don’t say is that gold is a <em>natural</em> resource that has a lot of different uses in electronics, medicine, or even in food. Also, it’s naturally hard to obtain, it’s produced only in rare cosmic events, like supernova explosions or neutron stars collisions. And what is Bitcoin without its original purpose?</p>

<p>Well, it’s certainly a masterpiece, the first of a kind. But in this perspective it’s comparable with works of arts. They also have value, but no particular, instrumental purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, Bitcoin value will be pure speculation in the future with more advanced technologies. But in its current price there is also a huge amount of speculation. With no doubt the majority of people “invest” in Bitcoin just to raise a fortune, not to use it as payment. Though, I wouldn’t call it an investment. A typical investment is supposed to be spent on the production of new value. But no new value is produced when you buy Bitcoin. This is why it looks just like a financial pyramid — newcomers are the only reason for the price growth.</p>

<h3 id="a-huge-oxymoron"><strong>A huge oxymoron</strong></h3>

<p>Finally, I want to address the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Despite imperfections, Bitcoin was built with great ideals in mind.
Decentralization and freedom are the values that humankind must pursue, I believe.</p>

<p>But the ecosystem that arose around Bitcoin is mostly ignorant of those ideals.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exchanges</em></strong></p>

<p>A huge part of the cryptocurrency world is the exchanges. 
But they are centralized! They are in control of your funds. You have to trust them. So there is no difference with an ordinary financial institution. Well, actually, there is. A cryptocurrency exchange found on the internet can be run by a high-school kid just for fun.</p>

<p>Exchanges possess a great value in cryptocurrencies and are responsible for a big part of all Bitcoin transactions. They are entities that have the power and resources to play with the market.</p>

<p>The problem of exchanges can’t be solved since truly decentralized exchanges are impossible or impractical.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mining pools</em></strong></p>

<p>A mining pool is a clever way to unite the computational resources needed for mining new blocks. But again, they are centralized and as a single miner you have to trust them. There are pools that require no trust in a coordinator, but they don’t propose additional incentives for a single miner.</p>

<p>A dozen mining pools generate around 75% of new Bitcoin blocks according to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/pools">these stats</a>. Control them — and you can control the network. Note that big exchanges have their own mining pools. Yeah, decentralization…</p>

<p><strong><em>Mixers</em></strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin mixer is a way to hide a transaction sender and receiver. The story is the same as with exchanges and pools. They are centralized in nature and this can’t be solved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stable cryptocurrencies</em></strong></p>

<p>This is the most ridiculous part and the best indicator of all of this farce. For me “stable cryptocurrency” is just an oxymoron. Operators of such mimic currencies are not only centralized and you have to trust them — they do not even comply with the laws of countries that print original currencies. They are worse than ordinary banks.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap</a>, Tether, a USD mimic, is in the third place by a total market value and largely exceeds Bitcoin in transactions volume. A clusterfuck in the world of cryptocurrencies, in my opinion. Decentralization? What decentralization?</p>

<h3 id="the-future"><strong>The future</strong></h3>

<p>While I’m a big proponent of decentralization, I don’t believe in the longtime future of Bitcoin. The only reason for its future survival is the respect of its users. I have no idea what price it can achieve, but I’m 100% sure the price will have a speculative nature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been theorized to provide protection against COVID-19. In a new study published in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology researchers provide further proof of this theory.</p><div id="text">
<p>Researches have shown, in new study <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e02628-20">published in mBio</a>, that mumps IgG titers, or levels of IgG antibody, are inversely <strong>correlated</strong> with severity in recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated with the MMR II vaccine produced by Merck. MMR II contains the <strong>Edmonston strain of measles</strong>, the Jeryl Lynn (B-level) strain of mumps, and the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of rubella.</p>
<p>"We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 <strong>who have had MMR II vaccinations</strong>," said lead study author Jeffrey E. Gold, president of World Organization, in Watkinsville, Georgia. "This adds to other associations demonstrating that <strong>the MMR vaccine may be protective against COVID-19</strong>. It also may explain why children have a much lower COVID-19 case rate than adults, as well as a much lower death rate. The majority of children get their first MMR vaccination around 12 to 15 months of age and a second one from 4 to 6 years of age."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 who have had MMR II vaccinations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new study, the researchers divided 80 subjects into 2 groups. The MMR II group consisted of 50 U.S. born subjects who would primarily <strong>have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine</strong>. A comparison group of 30 subjects had no record of MMR II vaccinations, and would primarily have MMR antibodies from other sources, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses. The researchers found a significant inverse correlation (rs = -0.71, P &lt; 0.001) between mumps titers and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II group. There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and disease severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group.</p>
<p>Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300 AU/ml (n=8) were only found in those who were functionally immune or asymptomatic. All with mild COVID-19 symptoms had mumps titers below 134 AU/ml (n=17). All with moderate symptoms had mumps titers below 75 AU/ml (n=11). All who had been hospitalized and required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n=5). Titers were measured by Quest Diagnostics using their standard diagnostic protocol.</p>
<p>"This is the <strong>first immunological study</strong> to evaluate the relationship between the MMR II vaccine and COVID-19. The statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titers and COVID-19 indicates that there is a relationship involved that warrants further investigation," said coauthor David J. Hurley, PhD, professor and molecular microbiologist at the University of Georgia. "The MMR II vaccine is considered a safe vaccine with very few side effects. If it has the ultimate benefit of preventing infection from COVID-19, preventing the spread of COVID-19, reducing the severity of it, or a combination of any or all of those, it is a very high reward low risk ratio intervention. Maximum seropositivity is achieved through two vaccinations at least 28 days apart. Based upon our study, it would be prudent to vaccinate those over 40 regardless of whether or not they already have high serum MMR titers."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://asm.org/">American Society for Microbiology</a> is one of the largest professional societies dedicated to the life sciences and is composed of 30,000 scientists and health practitioners. ASM's mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This is the first issue of <a href="https://learnocamlthehardway.substack.com/welcome">Learn OCaml the Hard Way</a>. A publication about learning OCaml from the ground up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span><span>[@</span>inline<span>]</span> get x i <span>=</span> String.unsafe_get x i <span>|&gt;</span> Char.code

  <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> 1 <span>to</span> ln <span>land</span> 1 <span>do</span> r <span>:=</span> <span>!</span>r <span>lor</span> <span>(</span>get a <span>(</span>ln <span>-</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>lxor</span> get b <span>(</span>ln <span>-</span> 1<span>))</span> <span>done</span> <span>;</span>
  <span>!</span>r <span>=</span> 0

<span>let</span> equal a b <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> al <span>=</span> String.length a <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> bl <span>=</span> String.length b <span>in</span>
  <span>if</span> al <span>&lt;&gt;</span> bl
  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>
<h2 id="read-the-asm">Read the asm</h2>
<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><code>eqaf</code> allows us to have a basic understanding about OCaml’s assembly output without inferences of GC, boxed values, and advanced syntaxes such as pattern matching. We will explore more in the future issues.</p>

<p>The Postgres.ai team is proud to announce version 2.0 of Database Lab Engine (DLE) for PostgreSQL, a modern database tool for building powerful development and testing environments based on <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/questions-and-answers#what-is-thin-cloning-thin-vs-thick-clones">thin cloning</a>. Using Database Lab API or CLI (and if you are using Database Lab SaaS, GUI), on a single machine with, say, a 1 TiB disk, you can easily create and destroy dozens of database copies of size 1 TiB each. All these copies are independently modifiable and created/destroyed in just a few seconds. This can become a game-changer in your development and testing workflow, improving time-to-market, and reducing costs of your non-production infrastructure.</p>
<p>This release continues our strategy to automate all routine tasks such as initialization of the PostgreSQL data directory, data transformation, and snapshot management. In DLE 2.0, all these tasks can be flexibly configured in a single configuration file. As a result, building dev&amp;test environments for projects with many databases (such as those that adopted microservice architecture) becomes much easier.</p>
<p>The previous versions of the Database Lab introduced the core technology: thin clone provisioning, based on either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> (default) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)">LVM</a>. It was already possible to provision full-sized multi-terabyte database clones in just a few seconds and use them for a broad spectrum of tasks such as database schema changes verification, SQL query analysis, or general application testing.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 speeds up and empowers the initialization of DLE itself. Instead of using custom scripts for initial and continuous data retrieval, it is now possible to configure everything in a declarative manner to get the data and be up and running.</p>
<h2 id="updates-in-dle-2-0">Updates in DLE 2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated data retrieval: specify the source and the method of initializing the data directory and how it is to be updated</li>
<li>Both physical (pg_basebackup, WAL-G, more) and logical methods (dump/restore, Amazon RDS, Heroku Postgres, more) are supported (see the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data">Database Lab Engine data sources</a>)</li>
<li>Any managed cloud PostgreSQL offering is now supported, with additional features for Amazon RDS (see <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/tutorials/database-lab-tutorial-amazon-rds">DLE tutorial for Amazon RDS</a> and the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data/rds">Data source: AWS RDS</a>)</li>
<li>For continuously updated physically initialized data directory (which effectively makes your DLE a specialized replica), snapshot management is fully automated: snapshots are created and destroyed based on the schedule defined in the configuration file (see the reference <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference#job-physicalsnapshot">Job physicalSnapshot</a>)</li>
<li>Basic data transformation and masking supported: specify any custom script that will be applied each time a new snapshot is prepared (option <code>preprocessingScript</code> in both <code>logicalSnapshot</code> and <code>physicalSnapshot</code> jobs, see the <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference">Configuration reference</a>)</li>
<li>License changed to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPLv3</a></li>
<li>The documentation is significantly extended: 3 tutorials, 26 user guides, 6 references, and counting: <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs">http://postgres.ai/docs</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      

      <p>
        WireGuard has gained traction over the past few years due, in part, to its high performance. We wondered how fast it really is, and realized that since we're already tracking VPN performance metrics for our <a href="https://vpnintel.com/unit-prices">VPN unit price index</a>, we could use the same data to answer the question, <strong>"how much faster is WireGuard than OpenVPN?"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We focused on Windscribe, Mullvad, and NordVPN, three providers that support both WireGuard and OpenVPN, and built a <a href="https://vpnintel.com/wireguard-vs-openvpn">dashboard</a> to visualize their comparative download speeds. We've embedded the charts for the week ending November 20, 2020 below along with some commentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all data on this page represent speedtests between U.S.-based speedtest servers and VPNs. Our methodology section below has more on this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <h2>Windscribe</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the week ending November 20, 2020, Windscribe's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>134 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>363 Mbps</span>. This means that by simply toggling the WireGuard option, Windscribe users can get a free 2.7x speed boost!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Windscribe averages are 339 Mbps for WireGuard and 144 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Windscribe's Wireguard speeds are almost always in the 300-400 Mbps ranges. Dig deeper into performance and pricing info on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe-wireguard">Windscribe WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe">Windscribe OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Mullvad</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullvad was one of WireGuard's earliest commercial supporters. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>258 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>672 Mbps</span> – a free 2.6x performance boost for Mullvad's WireGuard users!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Mullvad averages are 676 Mbps for WireGuard and 273 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Mullvad's WireGuard speeds consistently land in the 600-700 Mbps range. Take a closer look at the pricing and performance data on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad">Mullvad WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad-openvpn">Mullvad OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>NordVPN</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        NordVPN launched support for WireGuard via its NordLynx product in Spring 2020. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>395 Mbps</span>. If the only number you remember from this page is NordVPN's average WireGuard download speed, you'll have the idea: a ridiculously fast <span>777 Mbps</span>, a 1.9x boost over its OpenVPN service.
      </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day NordVPN averages are 780 Mbps for WireGuard and 416 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        You can see that NordVPN actually exceeds gigabit speeds on occasion. Its WireGuard speeds have a bit more variance than the other providers, but is uniformly well above 500 Mbps. For a deeper dive into NordLynx pricing and performance, check out our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn-wireguard">NordVPN WireGuard/NordLynx</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn">NordVPN OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        For the week ending November 20, 2020, our global average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>251 Mbps</span> and <span>583 Mbps</span> over WireGuard – WireGuard outperformed OpenVPN by an incredible 230%!
      </p>
      <p>
        All the more incredible is that customers of these services get this speed boost for free simply by selecting the WireGuard option.
      </p>
      <p>
        NordVPN's 1.9x ratio is a little lower than the other providers', but it still has a massive raw speed advantage. If NordVPN can get its WireGuard speeds up to the 2.5x+ ratios held by Windscribe and Mullvad, then it will be consistently serving gigabit speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it for now! We think this stuff is interesting, so we'll probably make this a monthly or quarterly report. If you'd like to know when we launch new tools and publish reports like this, please join our newsletter:

       As of November 24, 2020, WireGuard clocks in at 598 Mbps to OpenVPN's 287 Mbps, a 2.1x speed boost.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Our system is fully automated which lets us take thousands of readings a day. The data on this page represents speedtests conducted between servers based in the U.S. and VPN servers also based in the U.S. – the speeds shown here are likely to be faster than what you would experience at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        All speedtests are done over UDP with the native OpenVPN and WireGuard Linux clients except for NordVPN's NordLynx/WireGuard service which uses the NordVPN Linux client since NordVPN does not provide WireGuard configuration files.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least as of November 20, 2020, you'll see some lumps shared across the three charts which may reflect resource usage patterns for our own hosting provider. We will report back on this.

          <a name="topofpage"></a>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

<p>I was reading another engineer’s story this week about <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs">his 65-day job hunt</a>. I’ve avoided traditional job applications and interviews since I graduated from college, but a few things struck me from this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of targeting <em>every</em> job, Matt Dupree selectively applied at <strong>only 16 companies</strong> and withdrew applications when he thought the company was a bad fit. I love this advice.</li>
<li>Matt has built side projects, spoken at conferences, and blogged consistently for years. <strong>He walked into interviews with a trust level much higher than random applicants.</strong> I have said this before: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">coding skills are not enough to build a resilient career</a>.</li>
<li>Technical interviews still tell employers very little about an engineer’s ability (that’s a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">whole other blog post</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Not everyone has the luxury of choice when it comes to choosing their next job, but if you’re a software engineer, you should be able to get there. There’s more demand for our skillset than there is supply, but you have to be intentional if you want to build a resilient career.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resilient-career">What is a “resilient career”?</h2>
<p>People with resilient careers don’t fear an economic downturn because they have been able to put a little money aside. They don’t fear losing their job because they probably have half a dozen offers they’ve declined in the past year. They don’t stress about financial concerns because they likely have one or two side hustles bringing in a little extra cash flow.</p>
<p>I mentioned at the top that I’ve haven’t applied for a job since college. Skipping this step in the job search has been possible because I’ve approached my career very differently from most software engineers. Here are my rules for creating a resilient career:</p>
<h3 id="1-only-work-for-companies-that-need-and-trust-you">1. Only work for companies that need and trust you</h3>
<p>I skipped the job application process with all three of my jobs since college by doing the work that companies wanted before I officially started working for them.</p>
<p>No, I don’t mean you should work for free. Here’s how it played out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uloop hired me to start their blog because I spent my free time in college building a blog, recruiting writers, and learning to code. I worked as a contractor for Uloop while I finished college, and when I graduated, bringing me on full-time just meant signing a W2.</li>
<li>Packback hired me because I stayed in touch with the founder for about nine months before they had any funding. When they were looking to hire a full-time engineer, they gave me a project from their roadmap. I did it as a freelancer, then joined full-time after I turned it in.</li>
<li>The Graide Network brought me on months after I started building a relationship with their founder. Instead of interviewing, I began as a consultant a couple of nights per week before they had the funding to bring me on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During each of these test periods, I got to see how much the company needed someone with my skill set, build trust with them, and get a trial run of the day-to-day. If I ever look for a job again, I’ll keep using the same approach because it works well.</p>
<h3 id="2-your-network-is-your-biggest-asset">2. Your network is your biggest asset</h3>
<p>You might also notice that two of my three of these career moves involved knowing my boss for months before joining. Notice that I didn’t run into them at a Meetup one night and get hired the next day.</p>
<p>For some reason, Engineers hear “you should network more,” and think that means they should go out and meet new people. That’s not how it works. Relationships take months or years to cultivate. You <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have to stay in touch</a> if you ever want them to pay off.</p>
<p>Spend maybe 25% of your time meeting new people and 75% of your time staying in touch with people who you genuinely like. Personal relationships are founded on common interests, goals, or experiences, so find a mix of people who are both ahead of and behind you in your journey.</p>
<h3 id="3-cultivate-a-variety-of-interests-and-potential-revenue-generators">3. Cultivate a variety of interests and potential revenue generators</h3>
<p>I have always had a side project or two - mostly learning opportunities - but in the past three years, I’ve realized that you can generate revenue and build a network from them. Over the years, my side projects have led to consulting gigs, job offers, freelance opportunities, and a lot of high-quality connections around the world.</p>
<p>For example, CFP Land makes <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/cfp-land">a couple hundred dollars per month in profit</a>, which is fine, but the connections I’ve made from running it are worth orders of magnitude more. My previous side project, <a href="https://github.com/jobapis">Job APIs</a>, brings me multiple consulting offers per month (99% of them aren’t worth doing, but still, it’s nice to know they’re there).</p>
<p>My point is, anything I do in my free time is an investment in making my career more resilient.</p>
<h3 id="4-learn-on-your-employers-dime">4. Learn on your employer’s dime</h3>
<p>I was talking to a friend recently about his job search. He was lamenting that after five years of working hard for his employer and being let go, he was struggling to find another company that used the same tech stack.</p>
<p>“How much time did you spend learning new tools, libraries, or frameworks each week while you were at your prior job?” I asked.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t time for that,” he lamented, “We were always pushing to the max to get stuff done on time.”</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that my friend’s employer let him go. He wasn’t growing and when the company needed fewer resources in his engineering realm, he was too specialized to move into another area. He was seen as a resource that had to be let go. I used to think you could <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/be-indispensable">be indispensible</a> by being the best at one thing, but I’m starting to move away from that belief.</p>
<p>Any employer I work for gets me working ~35 hours per week on the projects we plan and ~5 hours per week learning new things. My value to my employer only increases as I become a more well-rounded engineer, so learning is non-negotiable. Now I bake this into my team’s weekly retrospectives - we share what we’re learning with each other - so we can hold each other accountable for learning new things.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-journey-your-own">Make the journey your own</h2>
<p>Finally, what works for me won’t necessarily work for you. My journey has involved working for early-stage startups - which you might hate - and being a software development generalist. Still, I think the fundamental goal should be the same: to build a resilient career.</p>

<p>This post is hard to write, both in the emotional sense but also in the “I would
have written a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time” sense. Hence, please
assume the best of intentions when reading it—it is not my intention to make
anyone feel bad about their contributions, but rather to provide some insight
into why my frustration level ultimately exceeded the threshold.</p>

<p>Debian has been in my life for well over 10 years at this point.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I have visited some old friends at the Zürich Debian meetup
after a multi-year period of absence. On my bike ride home, it occurred to me
that the topics of our discussions had remarkable overlap with my last visit. We
had a discussion about the merits of systemd, which took a detour to respect in
open source communities, returned to processes in Debian and eventually
culminated in democracies and their theoretical/practical failings. Admittedly,
that last one might be a Swiss thing.</p>

<p>I say this not to knock on the Debian meetup, but because it prompted me to
reflect on what feelings Debian is invoking lately and whether it’s still a good
fit for me.</p>

<p>So I’m finally making a decision that I should have made a long time ago: I am
winding down my involvement in Debian to a minimum.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>

<p>Over the coming weeks, I will:</p>

<ul>
<li>transition packages to be team-maintained where it makes sense</li>
<li>remove myself from the <code>Uploaders</code> field on packages with other maintainers</li>
<li>orphan packages where I am the sole maintainer</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to keep up best-effort maintenance of the
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/">manpages.debian.org</a> service and the
<a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">codesearch.debian.net</a> service, but any help
would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, please treat me as permanently on vacation. I will
try to be around for administrative issues (e.g. permission transfers) and
questions addressed directly to me, permitted they are easy enough to answer.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>When I joined Debian, I was still studying, i.e. I had luxurious amounts of
spare time. Now, over 5 years of full time work later, my day job taught me a
lot, both about what works in large software engineering projects and how I
personally like my computer systems. I am very conscious of how I spend the
little spare time that I have these days.</p>

<p>The following sections each deal with what I consider a major pain point, in no
particular order. Some of them influence each other—for example, if changes
worked better, we could have a chance at transitioning packages to be more
easily machine readable.</p>

<h3 id="change-process-in-debian">Change process in Debian</h3>

<p>The last few years, my current team at work conducted various smaller and larger
refactorings across the entire code base (touching thousands of projects), so we
have learnt a lot of valuable lessons about how to effectively do these
changes. It irks me that Debian works almost the opposite way in every regard. I
appreciate that every organization is different, but I think a lot of my points
do actually apply to Debian.</p>

<p>In Debian, packages are nudged in the right direction by a document called the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>, or its programmatic
embodiment, lintian.</p>

<p>While it is great to have a lint tool (for quick, local/offline feedback), it is
even better to not require a lint tool at all. The team conducting the change
(e.g. the C++ team introduces a new hardening flag for all packages) should be
able to do their work transparent to me.</p>

<p>Instead, currently, all packages become lint-unclean, all maintainers need to
read up on what the new thing is, how it might break, whether/how it affects
them, manually run some tests, and finally decide to opt in. This causes a lot
of overhead and manually executed mechanical changes across packages.</p>

<p>Notably, the <strong>cost of each change</strong> is distributed onto the package maintainers in
the Debian model. At work, we have found that the opposite works better: if the
team behind the change is put in power to do the change for as many users as
possible, they can be significantly more efficient at it, which reduces the
total cost and time a lot. Of course, exceptions (e.g. a large project abusing a
language feature) should still be taken care of by the respective owners, but
the important bit is that the default should be the other way around.</p>

<p>Debian is <strong>lacking tooling for large changes</strong>: it is hard to programmatically
deal with packages and repositories (see the section below). The closest to
“sending out a change for review” is to open a bug report with an attached
patch. I thought the workflow for accepting a change from a bug report was too
complicated and started <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2016-07-17-mergebot/">mergebot</a>, but only Guido
ever signaled interest in the project.</p>

<p>Culturally, reviews and reactions are slow. There are no deadlines. I literally
sometimes get emails notifying me that a patch I sent out a few years ago (!!)
is now merged. This turns projects from a small number of weeks into many years,
which is a huge demotivator for me.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, you can see artifacts of the slow online activity manifest
itself in the offline culture as well: I don’t want to be discussing systemd’s
merits 10 years after I first heard about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, changes can easily be slowed down significantly by holdouts who refuse
to collaborate. My canonical example for this is rsync, whose maintainer refused
my patches to make the package use debhelper purely out of personal preference.</p>

<p>Granting so much personal freedom to individual maintainers prevents us as a
project from raising the abstraction level for building Debian packages, which
in turn makes tooling harder.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>As a project, we should strive towards more unification. Uniformity still
does not rule out experimentation, it just changes the trade-off from easier
experimentation and harder automation to harder experimentation and easier
automation.</li>
<li>Our culture needs to shift from “this package is my domain, how dare you
touch it” to a shared sense of ownership, where anyone in the project can
easily contribute (reviewed) changes without necessarily even involving
individual maintainers.</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about how successful large changes can look like, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrC6ROeV4GI">my
colleague Hyrum Wright’s talk “Large-Scale Changes at Google: Lessons Learned
From 5 Yrs of Mass Migrations”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fragmented-workflow-and-infrastructure">Fragmented workflow and infrastructure</h3>

<p>Debian generally seems to prefer decentralized approaches over centralized
ones. For example, individual packages are maintained in separate repositories
(as opposed to in one repository), each repository can use any SCM (git and svn
are common ones) or no SCM at all, and each repository can be hosted on a
different site. Of course, what you do in such a repository also varies subtly
from team to team, and even within teams.</p>

<p>In practice, non-standard hosting options are used rarely enough to not justify
their cost, but frequently enough to be a huge pain when trying to automate
changes to packages. Instead of using GitLab’s API to create a merge request,
you have to design an entirely different, more complex system, which deals with
intermittently (or permanently!) unreachable repositories and abstracts away
differences in patch delivery (bug reports, merge requests, pull requests,
email, …).</p>

<p>Wildly diverging workflows is not just a temporary problem either. I
participated in long discussions about different git workflows during DebConf
13, and gather that there were similar discussions in the meantime.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot keep enough details of the different workflows in my
head. Every time I touch a package that works differently than mine, it
frustrates me immensely to re-learn aspects of my day-to-day.</p>

<p>After noticing workflow fragmentation in the Go packaging team (which I
started), I tried fixing this with the <a href="https://go-team.pages.debian.net/workflow-changes.html">workflow changes
proposal</a>, but did not
succeed in implementing it. The lack of effective automation and slow pace of
changes in the surrounding tooling despite my willingness to contribute time and
energy killed any motivation I had.</p>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-package-uploads">Old infrastructure: package uploads</h3>

<p>When you want to make a package available in Debian, you upload GPG-signed files
via anonymous FTP. There are several batch jobs (the queue daemon, <code>unchecked</code>,
<code>dinstall</code>, possibly others) which run on fixed schedules (e.g. <code>dinstall</code> runs
at 01:52 UTC, 07:52 UTC, 13:52 UTC and 19:52 UTC).</p>

<p>Depending on timing, I estimated that you might wait for over 7 hours (!!)
before your package is actually installable.</p>

<p>What’s worse for me is that feedback to your upload is asynchronous. I like to
do one thing, be done with it, move to the next thing. The current setup
requires a many-minute wait and costly task switch for no good technical
reason. You might think a few minutes aren’t a big deal, but when all the time I
can spend on Debian per day is measured in minutes, this makes a huge difference
in perceived productivity and fun.</p>

<p>The last communication I can find about speeding up this process is <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/12/msg00014.html">ganneff’s
post</a> from 2008.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>Anonymous FTP would be replaced by a web service which ingests my package and
returns an authoritative accept or reject decision in its response.</li>
<li>For accepted packages, there would be a status page displaying the build
status and when the package will be available via the mirror network.</li>
<li>Packages should be available within a few minutes after the build completed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-bug-tracker">Old infrastructure: bug tracker</h3>

<p>I dread interacting with the Debian bug
tracker. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbugs">debbugs</a> is a piece of software
(from 1994) which is only used by Debian and the GNU project these days.</p>

<p>Debbugs processes emails, which is to say it is asynchronous and cumbersome to
deal with. Despite running on the fastest machines we …</p></div></div>

<p>
I don’t usually talk about money, but a friend asked me what it was like to get rich, and he wanted to know specifics, so I told him my story.
</p><p>
I had <a href="https://sive.rs/xn">a day job</a> in midtown Manhattan paying $20K per year — about minimum wage.
On weekends I would earn $150 per day performing circus shows for kids, though I’d spend about $50 in bus fare to get to the gigs.
I was sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates in Queens, so our rent was $333 per month each.
I made peanut butter sandwiches for three meals a day, and at night maybe some eggs.
I never ate out, and never took a taxi.
<strong>
My cost of living was about $1000/month, and I was earning $1800/month.
I did this for two years, and saved up $12,000.
</strong>
I was 22 years old.
</p><p>
Once I had $12,000 I could quit my job and become a full-time musician.
I knew I could get a few gigs per month to pay my cost of living.
So I was free.
<a href="https://sive.rs/nq">I quit my job</a> a month later, and never had a job again.
</p><p>
When I finished telling my friend this story, he asked for more.
I said no, that was it.
He said, “No, what about when you sold your company?”
</p><p>
I said no, that didn’t make a big difference in my life.
That was just more money in the bank.
The difference happened when I was 22.
</p><p>
It’s not how much you have.
<strong>
It’s the difference between what you have and what you spend.
</strong>
If you have more than you spend, you’re rich.
If you spend more than you have, you’re not.
If you live cheaply, it’s easy to be free.
</p><p>
Magicians wave one hand around to get your attention, while the other hand does the trick.
To be smart, watch the other hand.

<p>This post was prompted by a tweet by Frank Harrell yesterday asking:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this post I'll say a little bit about trying to answer Frank's question, and then a little bit about an alternative question which I posed in response, namely, how does the interpretation change if the interval is a Bayesian credible interval, rather than a frequentist confidence interval.</p>



<h2>Frequentist confidence intervals</h2>



<p>A frequentist 95% confidence interval is constructed such that if the model assumptions are correct, if you were to (hypothetically) repeat the experiment or sampling many many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true value of the parameter. I made a short video last year which performs a simulation in R to demonstrate this definition/idea:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1125" height="633" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGXg6L98lJM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Frank asked how one interprets a particular realised confidence interval (0.72,0.91). The difficulty (as he is well aware!) is that all a frequentist can say is that this particular realised interval either does or does not contain the true parameter value, and they cannot tell you if it does or doesn't. All they can say is that if modelling assumptions are correct, in hypothetical repetitions 95% of the intervals constructed using this procedure contain the true value.</p>



<h2>Bayesian credible intervals</h2>



<p>Let’s now suppose that we’ve done a Bayesian analysis. We’ve specified a prior distribution for the parameter, based on prior evidence, our subjective beliefs about the value of the parameter, or perhaps we used a default ‘non-informative’ prior built into our software package. We use the same model as before, and Bayes theorem gives us the posterior distribution. A Bayesian posterior credible interval is constructed, and suppose it gives us some values. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume the interval is again 0.72 to 0.91, but this is not done to suggest a Bayesian analysis credible interval will generally be identical to the frequentist's confidence interval.</p>



<p>How should we interpret this credible interval? A Bayesian would I think say say something like it is an interval for which there is a 95% chance or probability the true parameter lies. At this point we must ask, what do they mean by 95% probability?</p>



<p>We could interpret it as a classical long run frequentist probability, but this means interpreting it like a confidence interval. In fact Bayesian procedures often have good frequentist properties. For example see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/343/2013/03/large-sample.pdf" target="_blank">Wang and Robins 1998</a> for an analysis of the frequentist properties of multiple imputation for missing data, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0962280216667764" target="_blank">Bartlett and Keogh 2018</a> for a simulation investigation of the frequentist properties of Bayesian approaches for handling covariate measurement error. In fact, under certain conditions, Bayesian procedures achieve the same frequentist properties of maximum likelihood methods when the sample size gets large - see Chapter 4 of Gelman <em>et al</em>'s excellent<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bayesian Data Analysis book</a>.</p>



<p>But conceptually we do not choose to do a Bayesian analysis simply as a means to performing frequentist inference. We choose it because it (hopefully) answers more directly what we are interested in (see Frank Harrell's '<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fharrell.com/post/journey/" target="_blank">My Journey From Frequentist to Bayesian Statistics</a>' post). Namely, it enables us to make probability statements about the unknown parameter given our model, the prior, and the data we have observed. So what is the interpretation of the 95% chance or probability for a credible interval? </p>



<p>I don't know the no doubt large literature on this topic well at all, but the Bayesian's interpretation or definition of probability isn't that clear to me. The Wikipedia entry on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability" target="_blank">Bayesian probability</a> says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations of Bayesian probability. For objectivists, who interpret probability as an extension of logic, probability quantifies the reasonable expectation that everyone (even a "robot") who shares the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by Cox's theorem.[2][8] For subjectivists, probability corresponds to a personal belief.[3] Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the Dutch book argument or by decision theory and de Finetti's theorem.[3] The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.</p><cite>Wikipedia entry on Bayesian probability</cite></blockquote>



<p>Section 1.5 'Probability as a measure of uncertainty' of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayesian Data Analysis</a> talks about the way Bayesian analysis uses probability as a measure of uncertainty, but to my mind it doesn't really define the concept. This is not a criticism. As Gelman et al say earlier in their book:</p>



<blockquote><p>Rather than argue the foundations of statistics—see the bibliographic note at the end of this chapter for references to foundational debates—we prefer to concentrate on the pragmatic advantages of the Bayesian framework, whose flexibility and generality allow it to cope with complex problems.</p></blockquote>



<p>If part of the appeal of Bayesian inference is that it answers the question we really want (i.e. conditional on what we've seen, what do we know / believe about the parameter(s)), it seems to me that the interpretation or definition of prior/posterior probabilities should be relatively straightforward and clear to us. But for me at least, it isn't. I am quite confident (whatever I mean by that!) that this reflects my ignorance on the topic. Part of my motivation for writing this post is the hope that people will help me understand better how to unambiguously define what is meant by a Bayesian prior/posterior probability. Please write a comment if you can help in this regard.</p>



<p>The above does not mean I don't like Bayesian methods. Indeed much of the last 10 years I have been working with and using methods like multiple imputation for missing data whose development take place in the Bayesian paradigm. For me this is fine because I know that methods like multiple imputation have good frequentist properties, and while there are definitely interpretational issues with things confidence intervals, I at least think I understand what they claim to do/be.</p>



<h2>22nd November 2022 postscript</h2>



<p>This evening there was further discussion of this topic on Twitter. As part of this Frank Harrell offered an interpretation for the Bayesian credible interval as follows:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Under data model F and prior P, [0.72, 0.91] is the shortest interval such that the probability the unknown OR generating our data is in that interval is 0.95 (highest posterior density interval).</p>— Frank Harrell (@f2harrell) <a href="https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1330633833713111040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I followed up with him as to the nature of the probability being referred to here, since it is clear that the probability notion being invoked is broader or distinct than the relative frequency notion of probability. Frank helpfully pointed me in the direction of the entry for 'probability' in his course glossary of terms, which can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf" target="_blank">accessed here</a>. Part of this entry says:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;attached to the metric known as a probability is up to the user; it can represent long-run relative frequency of repeatable observations, a degree of belief, or a measure of veracity or plausibility.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote><p>There are other schools of probability that do not require the notion of replication at all. For example, the school of&nbsp;subjective&nbsp;probability (associated with the&nbsp;Bayesian&nbsp;school) “considers probability as a measure of the degree of belief of a given subject in the occurrence of an event or, more generally, in the veracity of a given assertion” (see P. 55 of5). de Finetti defined subjective probability in terms of wagers and odds in betting. A risk-neutral individual would be willing to wager $P&nbsp;that an event will occur when the payoff is $1 and her subjective probability is&nbsp;P&nbsp;for the event.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>As I wrote in the original post, I do not know the extensive literature on this topic well at all. But what Frank has summarised here is really useful in aiding my understanding of what the interpretation should be of the 95% probability statement attached to a 95% credible interval. It seems to me the notion of probability being invoked when interpreting a 95% credible interval has to be the subjective probability / degree of belief one described in the previous quote. Whether this definition/interpretation meets the criterion of being 'exact', as required by Frank in his tweet at the top of this post when asking for the exact interpretation of a particular realised frequentist confidence interval, I leave readers to decide.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="device-pinning">
  Device Pinning
  <a href="#device-pinning">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cpu"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tensors Created During Tracing Will Have Their Device Pinned</strong></p>
<p>This can be a significant performance and portability problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="performance-and-portability">
  Performance and Portability
  <a href="#performance-and-portability">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<h2 id="direct-graph-modification">
  Direct Graph Modification
  <a href="#direct-graph-modification">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>

        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing. The export path to ONNX and then to TensorRT can fail due to missing or incompatible operations at either step and this can be frustrating.</p>

<p>The Last Super is<strong> brand new Super Nintendo (SNES) game</strong> created to celebrate the 30th birthday of the console!</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1NzUyMDUuZ2lm/original/sd47O2.gif"><br></p>
<p>As the last SNES cartridge on Earth, you'll have to move and jump around in each of the 20 levels of the game so every SNES can play you! But don't let a SNES without cartridge for too long...</p>
<h2>SNES ROM or cartridge?</h2>
<p>The Last Super is an actual game for the Super Nintendo / SNES / Super Famicom console. If you want to play it on a real console, you can <a href="https://catskullelectronics.com/collections/games/products/the-last-super" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">buy a beautiful game cartridge</a> from Catskull Games. As an extra bonus, this cartridge also contains my previous SNES game <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/keeping-snes-alive" target="_blank">Keeping SNES Alive!</a><br></p>

<p>The cartridge is made from newly built elements<em> (PCB, shells, etc)</em> all designed and hand assembled in the US by Catskull himself. The cartridge is region-free. It has been tested and working on NTSC SNES, PAL SNES, JP SFC, and Analogue Super Nt.</p>
<p>If your prefer to play it on emulator, you can <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">download a ROM version of the game here</a>, and use it with any SNES emulator you like. Here are a few examples: </p>

<h2>Looking for challenge?</h2>
<p>My <strong>current record in survival mode is 35</strong>. Here's the proof:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1ODEyMzIuanBn/original/sTHVSK.jpg"><br></p>
<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>The game was <strong>programmed in C</strong> using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PVSNESlib</a> by Alekmaul.</p>
<p>The <strong>music was composed by </strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/xracecar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>XRACECAR</strong></a>. The two tracks are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"ayyy you know the man"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/</a> <em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></em></li><li><em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a>"7049 Bytes of Memories"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>A fun fact about the audio</strong>: the <em>"shlack</em>" sound that you hear when the cartridge enters a console is an<strong> actual recording of the noise made by my SNES power button</strong> <em>(recorded directly from my childhood console, still alive and kicking after 30 years!)</em></p>
<p>Last but not the least, <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">the full source code is included</a>.<strong> I spent a lot of time cleaning up and commenting the code as thoroughly as I could</strong>, hoping it'll help and motivate you to start making new SNES games too!<br></p></div></div>]]>

Such as their name, email, phone, company name, website, or department. During the same flow, we also ask them to create a password or link their social accounts via OAuth2.</p><p>So why was qrmenucreator so refreshing? You don't even need to sign up!

Very clever and doesn't feel like an information grab.</p><h2>How can I use this?</h2><p>For a SaaS product that doesn't use public URLs (i.e: handles sensitive data):</p><ol><li>Ask for only the email on the marketing page.</li><li>Save the email to your database and generate a unique UUID for that account.</li><li>Create a session associated with the UUID and redirect the user to the app.</li><li>To log back into the app they can either use a magic link via email or create a password.</li></ol><p>For a SaaS product that can use public URLs:</p><ol><li>Generate a unique UUID for the "thing" your user creates.</li><li>Give your user a unique URL to use to edit/delete their "thing".</li><li>Prompt for sending the unique URL to their email to stop them from losing access to their "thing".</li><li>You now have a user you can email for upsells.</li></ol><h2>Questions</h2><h3>What about personalisation?</h3><p>Make providing extra information part of "completing their profile" (i.e: gamify giving away data).

Hot tip you should make the "verify" button open up mail.google.com or outlook.com based on the email domain.</p><h3>I already have good conversion</h3><p>Imagine what your conversion rate would look like if you removed all but one of your sign up fields?</p><h3>My sales team needs X/Y info</h3><p>If the customer wants to be contacted then you can email them 🤷.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3 id="openmp-vs-posix-threads">OpenMP vs POSIX threads</h3>
<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://hasithsen.github.io/tech/posts/parallelizing-pi-approx-openmp/Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png" alt="Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png"></span><span><span>Just as we learned a long time ago in Kindergarten, the value of the integral here is the area between the graph and the x-axis while x goes from 0 to 1.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The most exciting moment of the web application development is a deployment. Your app is going live! It can also be nerve-wracking moment. Unfortunately. There are many options, many variables and configurations. It is easy to miss something … In this article, I will show you how to pack Django and React application into containers and deploy them with <code>docker-compose</code>. The presented approach can be reused on any Cloud Provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, GCP, Heroku) - you just need a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>

<p>In this article:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will create two <code>docker-compose</code> configuration files. One for development (easier version) and one for production (with SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>).</li>
  <li>The React static files will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The Django static files (from admin and DRF browsable API) will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>nginx</code> will be reverse-proxy to the Django server (<code>gunicorn</code>).</li>
  <li>In the production, we will add <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"><code>certbot</code></a> to renew the certificate. To issue a certificate we will use a bash script. You need to have a domain to issue the certificate .</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be using code from the previous article: <a href="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/crud-django-rest-framework-react/">CRUD in Django Rest Framework and React</a> (code with <a href="https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate/tree/v6">tag v6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="create-dockerfile-for-django-and-nginx">Create Dockerfile for Django and Nginx</h2>

<p>Let’s start by adding a new directory <code>docker</code> in the main directory of the project. Your project structure should look like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── backend
├── docker
├── frontend
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the <code>docker</code> directory please add <code>backend</code> directory with two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>docker/backend/Dockerfile</code> - it will define how to build Django container,</li>
  <li><code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> - it will be entrypoint for Django container. It will apply migrations, collect static files and run WSGI server with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/"><code>gunicorn</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="django-dockerfile">Django Dockerfile</h3>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> to build Django container:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># docker/backend/Dockerfile</span>

<span>FROM</span><span> python:3.8.3-alpine</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend/requirements.txt /app/backend/</span>


<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>--upgrade</span> pip
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install </span>gunicorn
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> backend/requirements.txt

<span>ADD</span><span> ./docker /app/docker</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend /app/backend</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this <code>Dockerfile</code> the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is used as base image. Let’s decode this image name and tag. It contains python in version <code>3.8.3</code>, running in the Linux distribution <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/"><code>Alpine</code></a> which is lightweight. The purpose of using lightweight Linux is to have small image which will result in faster builds. You can of course use different base image. For purpose of this tutorial the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is sufficient.</p>

<p>We create <code>/app</code> directory in the container and copy <code>/backend/requirements.txt</code>. Then, <code>gunicorn</code> and all needed packages are installed. The backend source code is copied at the end of the container build. It is on purpose. It makes building faster. When you change something in the code (without changing the <code>requirements.txt</code> file), only the last line of the <code>Dockerfile</code> will be executed and the rest will be read from cache (of course if available).</p>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> is not executing any command, we will use <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> script for this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="docker-entrypoint">Docker entrypoint</h3>

<p>Please add a new file <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> and add execute rights to the file (it is a bash script):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># add execute rights</span>
<span>chmod</span> +x docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>until </span><span>cd</span> /app/backend/server
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for server volume..."</span>
<span>done

until</span> ./manage.py migrate
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for db to be ready..."</span>
    <span>sleep </span>2
<span>done</span>

./manage.py collectstatic <span>--noinput</span>

gunicorn server.wsgi <span>--bind</span> 0.0.0.0:8000 <span>--workers</span> 4 <span>--threads</span> 4

<span>#####################################################################################</span>
<span># Options to DEBUG Django server</span>
<span># Optional commands to replace abouve gunicorn command</span>

<span># Option 1:</span>
<span># run gunicorn with debug log level</span>
<span># gunicorn server.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1 --threads 1 --log-level debug</span>

<span># Option 2:</span>
<span># run development server</span>
<span># DEBUG=True ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above script is waiting till serever volume and database is ready. It runs migration on database and collect static files. It runs <code>gunicorn</code> server with IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> and (docker default IP) and port <code>8000</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>gunicorn</code> is running <code>4</code> workers with <code>4</code> threads each. You can set different numbers here. It depends on your machine. There are some heuristic rules that set number of workers as <code>4 * CPU cores</code> (see the <a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#workers">gunicorn docs</a>). If you are deploying application to machine with 1 CPU core, then you can use <code>4</code> workers. (Remember, it is just heuristic not an exact rule). Then you can specify how many threads will be running in each worker. In our case, there are <code>4</code> threads (<a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#threads">gunicorn docs</a>). This means that we can process <code>4 * 4 = 16</code> concurrent requests.</p>

<p><strong>1st Note:</strong> We are using <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for our development - it doesn’t support concurrency. We will need to replace SQLite with advanced database engine like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I will replace database at the end of this tutorial to make final deployment. I think it is good to deploy application. We will practice deployment and code updates in the production. That’s why we are here.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Note:</strong> One more thing, I added other options to run Django server in <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> which are commmented. Why? You might need them for debugging. The first option add logging to the console with debug level and run <code>gunicorn</code> with one worker and single thread. The second option runs Django development server with <code>DEBUG=True</code>. It needs setting environment variable and load it in <code>settings.py</code> with <a href="https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple"><code>python-decouple</code></a> (for example), I will write about this in the future post.</p>

<h4 id="django-static-files">Django static files</h4>

<p>Before going further, let’s update <code>STATIC_URL</code> variable in the <code>backend/server/server/settings.py</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># backend/server/server/settings.py
</span>
<span>MEDIA_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/media/'</span>
<span>STATIC_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/django_static/'</span> 
<span>STATIC_ROOT</span> <span>=</span> <span>BASE_DIR</span> <span>/</span> <span>'django_static'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We overwrite <code>STATIC_URL</code> with a new value. All static files will be served with <code>/django_static/</code> in the URL. We add two new variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>MEDIA_URL</code> - it is URL for serving files uploaded to Django application, we will use it in future posts.</li>
  <li><code>STATIC_ROOT</code> - it is a directory where static files from Django application will be stored after running <code>collectstatic</code> command. The <code>nginx</code> will point to this path.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nginx-dockerfile-and-configuration">Nginx Dockerfile and Configuration</h3>

<p>Please add <code>nginx</code> directory in the <code>docker</code> directory. There will be added three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> - the instructions how to build <code>nginx</code> container image,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/development/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for <code>nginx</code> server used in the development,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/production/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for the production.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> for <code>nginx</code> container will use two stage build.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At first stage, we build the React static files.</li>
  <li>At second stage, the static files are copied and <code>nginx</code> server starts. We copy React static files into <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># The first stage</span>
<span># Build React static files</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> node:13.12.0-alpine as build</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app/frontend</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package.json ./</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package-lock.json ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm ci <span>--silent</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/ ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm run build

<span># The second stage</span>
<span># Copy React static files and start nginx</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> nginx:stable-alpine</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> --from=build /app/frontend/build /usr/share/nginx/html</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the second stage, we copy only the final product of the first stage: static files. The <code>node_modules</code> (they can take a lot of space) with dependency files are not in the final image. Such two stage-build makes the size of the final image smaller.</p>

<p>Let’s add <code>nginx</code> configuration for development version of <code>docker-compose</code> (without SSL certificate):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>

        <span>alias</span> <span>/app/backend/server/django_static/</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you feel when you see <code>nginx</code> configuration file?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No troubles! The <code>nginx</code> is here to help us. It will do what we will ask in the configuration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_tokens</span> <span>off</span><span>;</span>
    <span>client_max_body_size</span> <span>20M</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the begining of the configuration we define a server (<code>server</code> keyword). It will listen on port <code>80</code> (it is a default <code>HTTP</code> port). There is no name assigned to the server (<code>server_name _;</code>). We switch off option to show server version on error pages (<code>server_token off;</code> <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_tokens">see docs</a>). The last setting is to set maximum request size (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size">see docs</a>) (<code>client_max_body_size 20M</code>). It means that requests larger than 20MB will result in error with HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large).</p>

<p>We have five <code>location</code> blocks (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location">location docs</a>) in the config which specify configuration for each URL (routing for requests).</p>

<p>The first <code>location /</code> defines what to do if the request comes from <code>/</code> (main domain or IP). The <code>index.html</code> file from <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> will be served as a response. It is our React static <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>root</span>   <span>/usr/share/nginx/html</span><span>;</span>
        <span>index</span>  <span>index.html</span> <span>index.htm</span><span>;</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>$uri</span><span>/</span> <span>/index.html</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second and third locations <code>location /api</code> and <code>location /admin</code> redirect requests to <code>location @proxy_api</code>. It is a reverse-proxy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/api</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/admin</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What we have in fourth <code>location @proxy_api</code>? It is our Django application served with <code>gunicorn</code>. The <code>nginx</code> forwards all requests with <code>/api</code> and <code>/a…</code></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Regular 1-on-1 (often also written as 1:1) meetings are an important satisfaction factor for remote teams. For managers and companies, it's amazing to stay in the loop and resolve friction quickly. For employees, it's a rare chance to voice opinions and difficulties.</p>
<p>Especially in async environments and other remote teams where face-to-face time is sparse, this regularly scheduled personal time can be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's why 1-on-1s are extra important for remote teams, how they work best and why the greatest remote teams are so religious about them.</p>

<h2>What is a 1-on-1 meeting?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, a 1-on-1 meeting is a discussion between two parties. 1-on-1s are traditionally conducted for things like <strong>performance reviews</strong> or <strong>confidential discussions</strong> between a manager and their direct report.</p>
<p>In remote teams, face-to-face time can be sparse. It's more difficult to catch someone during their coffee break and talk things out. More formally scheduled 1-on-1s can be the solution for that.</p>
<p>Other than what's traditional, it's not uncommon to have 1-on-1s <strong>outside the manager-report relationship</strong>, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>satisfaction survey between employee and HR</li>
<li>knowledge exchange between team leaders</li>
<li>pair review between peers, co-working</li>
</ul>
<p>But even the more traditional manger-report 1-on-1 meetings <strong>holds more weight</strong> in remote work: It's the one place where employees can voice concerns, talk about their growth, their goals or any friction that has come up.</p>

<h2>The benefits of 1-on-1s for remote employees and managers</h2>
<p>When it comes to remote employees, regularly scheduled 1-on-1 meetings are a miracle tool when it comes to retention and employee satisfaction. As mentioned, they are a welcome place to voice concerns early or talk about growth.</p>
<p>For ambitious employees that creates an atmosphere where friction can get moved out of the way quickly, where ears are always open for concerns and growth desires can be made explicit.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_Meeting_re_i53h.png" alt="" width="600" height="358"></p>

<p>That sounds like an amazing deal for any employee, but obviously, it also comes at a high cost for managers.</p>
<p>For a team with 8 direct reports, bi-weekly 1-on-1s at a duration of 30 minutes per meeting, that's a full workday of added meeting time every single month! What's in it for the managers?</p>
<p>The benefits for employees can be reversed and are just as important for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>get rid of friction early</li>
<li>know where reports want to be in their careers</li>
<li>stay in the loop about newest developments</li>
<li>better picture of morale and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>Given any actionable manager, this is definitely worth its time as actions can be taken that improve satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>And indeed, <a href="https://www.leapsome.com/blog/meeting-with-purpose-the-unique-benefits-of-1-on-1-meetings">research shows</a> that while group meetings tend to lower employee satisfaction rates, 1-on-1 meetings actively improve that same metric!</p>

<h2>Productive 1-on-1 meetings methods</h2>
<p>1-on-1 meetings aren't hard to do right. As long as they are scheduled consistently and follows a common path – besides having a culture that allows for honest feedback – there's definitely a benefit to doing them.</p>
<p>As with so many things, some people have taken it a step further and created detailed methods and best practises to running 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>The traffic light check-in</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.connorswenson.com/blog/red-yellow-green-the-traffic-light-that-can-transform-your-meetings">traffic light check-in</a>, also called "Red Yellow Green" check-in is one of the meeting methods that has brought success to companies like Google, Etsy and many startups. So much, in fact, it's being taught by executive and management coaches around the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/eliobed-suarez-PN-YnI5stdQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>

<p>The concept is quite simple: If we take a traffic light as a model, your 1-on-1 partner describes their mood as one of the colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> means everything is OK, nothing that dampens the mood or blocks you from being near your peak. Let's talk.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> means so-so. Maybe things are stressful or there's an upcoming blocker. Let's discuss.</li>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is bad! The person is overwhelmed, blocked or is feeling terrible. Let's solve this.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative form of this is to collect topics and assign them to each of the colors, for example, <strong>green</strong> describes all the things that were great,&nbsp;<strong>yellow</strong> includes discussion topics that could have gone better and&nbsp;<strong>red</strong> are priority discussion points about things that failed.</p>

<h3>Skip-level meetings</h3>
<p>A skip-level meeting "skips" one layer of responsibility and is usually conducted with the person's manager's manager or even a head of department or CEO.</p>
<p>For remote teams, this can be a great irregular thing to schedule. On one side, employees have the possibility to discuss wider changes and bring up interesting ideas, while managers and executives have a more direct line to the culture and issues of their sub-reports.</p>
<p>Skip-level meetings are usually not done more than once per year per 1-on-1 combination, for leaders, however, it can be a good idea to schedule these monthly or even bi-weekly to have a deeper look into different teams.</p>

<h3>Goal and growth conversations</h3>
<p>A growth (or goal) conversation is different from the regular 1-on-1 check-ins as that it's designed to be a more formal evaluation and discussion. Other than the more traditional performance evaluation, it's a discussion around goals, current progress and growth.</p>
<p>As such, it doesn't have much influence on things like salaries or promotions but instead can help to improve employee satisfaction. In fact, <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/career-development-and-job-satisfaction/career-development-an-enabler-for-job-satisfaction">research shows</a> that the major reason for employee satisfaction boils down to career development, so it's something that shouldn't be dismissed.</p>
<p>Growth conversations happen more often than traditional evaluations – usually every quarter up to once per month – and help answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my short-term goal?</li>
<li>Did I reach my goal last time?</li>
<li>What stopped/enabled me to reach my goal?</li>
<li>What is my big goal for the next year?</li>
<li>What is my progress in reaching that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the situation, these conversations can be difficult. For ambitious employees, however, they could be the main driver in motivation, engagement, loyalty and retention.</p>

<h2>7 Tips for better 1-on-1 meetings</h2>
<p>When it comes to 1-on-1 meetings, learning by doing is the keyword. Even if you don't have a plan for them, to start today is to begin the investment in retention and loyalty.</p>
<p>Before you go, though, we hope that these practical tips can help you get started with better 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>1. Start with an agenda</h3>
<p>It's good practice to set up a way for you and your meeting partner to build an <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/remote-meeting-best-practices/">agenda before the call</a>. Some popular methods to do so are Google Docs and <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a>, where projects can be shared between two people.</p>
<p>The great part – simple to solve questions can be solved in writing even before the meeting and when it comes to harder discussions, your meeting partner can prepare for those beforehand. It also helps to keep meetings running smoothly and ending on time.</p>

<h3>2. Stick to a type of meeting</h3>
<p>A little earlier in this post, we described a few popular meeting techniques. While you can tweak meetings and even switch them around, it's usually good to stick to a certain interval and meeting form for a while, to make sure it works out.</p>
<p>Sticking to something for a while helps both of you to settle into a certain flow and helps with evaluating how good something works.</p>

<h3>3. Keep async stuff away</h3>
<p>In the first point, we talked about getting simple questions out of the way early through your agenda. Your agenda items should be evaluated whether they <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/making-asynchronous-communication-work/">should have been an email</a> – or a message – instead.</p>
<p>For example, it feels natural to give a status update during these meetings and checking in whether everything is on track. However, it's a better practice to write this down somewhere and have it recorded – so it can be crossed away from the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>Instead, the meeting should include socialization, talking about emotional topics and hashing out difficult discussions.</p>

<h3>4. Stay consistent</h3>
<p>As with anything, consistency is key! As you go into this new form of collaboration, give yourself the challenge to keep up with it for a few months or even a year.</p>
<p>It's important to keep each other accountable, so pick a specific timeslot, reserve a calendar block and don't make these optional. While some of them can be skipped, it shouldn't become the norm.</p>

<h3>5. Take notes</h3>
<p>Taking notes during the discussion can help you recall information, go back to previous meetings and find patterns and also help you to digest the information on the next day.</p>
<p>Hopefully, good notes can help you read between the lines and see recurring themes that are being discussed again and again.</p>

<h3>6. Build action items</h3>
<p>We all love homework, don't we! For 1-on-1 meetings, however, it could be a good idea to set agenda items and to-dos for the next meeting already, so-called action items.</p>
<p>These action items are usually not about the core work, but instead about the topics that were discussed – specific thoughts about growths or an issue that has been cumbersome for a few weeks.</p>

<h3>7. Run regular retrospectives</h3>
<p>1-on-1s are never set in stone! The great part about running these small meetings is that changes can happen quickly and easily – so, if anything doesn't work for you about these 1-on-1 meetings, change it! Be it timing, frequency, agenda or format, let none of it undiscovered!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A week ago, I was looking for something to tinker with over the weekend. I ended up switching my site hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">comparison was compelling</a>. I was appealed by the 1-click rollbacks, ability to use more Jekyll plug-ins, and A/B testing my site (fun!).</p>
<p>However, I switched back to GitHub Pages today. Why?</p>
<h2 id="my-mx-records-werent-migrated-automatically">My MX records werenâ€™t migrated automatically</h2>
<p>(MX records are DNS records for delivery email to your address.)</p>
<p>When I switched my DNS servers to Netlify, it was pretty painless: Update the DNS name servers, provision the cert, and weâ€™re good to go.</p>
<p>However, I didnâ€™t realize that my MX records werenâ€™t automatically migrated as well. (When I previously moved to Cloudflare, this was taken care of).</p>
<p>As a result, emails to my domain bounced for a few days before I noticed. Thankfully, people reached out via other channels to inform me of it.</p>
<h2 id="adding-mx-records-on-the-dns-provider-was-a-pain">Adding MX records on the DNS provider was a pain</h2>
<p>Trying to add the MX records with the DNS provider, NS1, was a pain.</p>
<p>I had to create an account with NS1 and provide them with credit card details. (Update: Was charged $2 within a day; will enquire why).</p>
<p>Then, I had to set up a â€œZoneâ€� to attach the MX records. However, when I tried setting up the zone for my domain, it was not allowed as the domain already exists. Probably from the Netlify integration.</p>
<p>I spent some time trying to figure this out. I also asked some Netlify folks. Turns out that while they use Netlify to host their site, they use other DNS providers (instead of NS1).</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-custom-certificate-didnt-work">Adding the custom certificate didnâ€™t work</h2>
<p>By now, Iâ€™ve switched my DNS provider back to Cloudflare, and added the Cloudflare Origin cert to my Netlify app. (I really wanted to continue using Netlify.)</p>
<p>However, I soon got complaints that people couldnâ€™t access my site due to the error: â€œPeerâ€™s Certificate issuer is not recognized.â€�. I faced the same issue too. Iâ€™m not sure where the issue lies (cert or host) but I had lost patience by now.</p>
<h2 id="another-gotcha-300-build-minutes-monthly">Another gotcha: 300 build minutes monthly</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">GitHub Pages vs Netlify comparison</a> indicates that both are free, with Netlify being superior at 3 builds a minute, it leaves out one major gotcha: On the free tier, Netlify only provides 300 minutes of build time monthly. AFAIK, GitHub Pages has no limitations.</p>
<p>For someone who frequently adds and tweaks content, and mucks around with the CSS and whatnot, 300 minutes didnâ€™t last long.</p>
<p>On its own, this limitation would have been bearableâ€”I figured I would try to be more frugal. But the DNS issues broke the camelâ€™s back.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-github-pages">Back to GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Now, Iâ€™m back to hosting on GitHub Pages and merrily pushing updates as inspiration strikes. Previously, I was checking the build minutes remaining ever so often.</p>
<p>I guess Iâ€™ll have to do without the fancy Jekyll plug-ins, 3 builds/min, and A/B testing for now. In return, I get peace of mind.</p>

<section>
<div>
<p><em>Edit: Thank you to the 80k people who have read this piece. It looks like many people are struggling with the concept of "greatness". Let's continue to support one another on the journey there. </em></p><p>Over the years, we’ve all encountered our fair share of successes and failures. As I’ve acquired more of both under my name, I’ve started to contemplate which experiences were truly “great” and why.</p><p>Interestingly enough, I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what <em>greatness</em> truly means. I’ve come to learn that it’s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Perhaps “great’, is just “good”, but repeatable. </strong></em></blockquote><h2 id="consider-this">Consider This</h2><p>Before stepping into the bulk of this article, I want to clarify two things:</p><ul><li>Greatness is not instantaneous</li><li>Greatness is earned</li></ul><p>The first step in becoming great is recognizing that you’re likely not already great. In fact, it comes from recognizing that there is no such thing as greatness at a specific instance in time. Greatness is instead a reflection of a period of effort, since greatness in a single instance can be reduced to luck. </p><p>Moreover, being “great” is not about being better than someone else. It is about being dependable and disciplined, and ultimately it is earned. </p><p>Many people, in theory, want to be “great”. In fact, each month 1000 people search “how to be great”, 260 people search “how to become perfect”, and 2400 people search “how to be the best”, looking for discrete answers on how to get from 0 to 1. Yet, many people in life realistically do not want to put in the effort over a sustained period of time to actually get to 1. They are looking for the “secrets to success” that in many ways, do not exist. You know what brings success? Hard work brings success. </p><p>So before proceeding forward in this article, I implore each of you to consider that if greatness truly is a reflection of non-instantaneous, earned effort, ask yourself if that’s the life you’d like to live. Ask yourself whether you’d like to spend your days, weeks, months, and years in a constant uphill battle. </p><p>If you ultimately find that you don’t want to do that, that’s fine! It doesn’t make you less of a person. At least you’ve broken from the holding pattern of thinking you want to do X but not understanding why you haven’t gotten there yet. And if that’s the case, go enjoy your Netflix and chill completely guilt-free.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s dive into what truly makes someone “great’. </p><h2 id="it-s-hard-to-be-consistent">It’s Hard to be Consistent</h2><p>There’s a false impression that success or notoriety comes with being flashy. This notion comes from the media focusing on outliers, whether it be events or personalities which diverge from the norm. Not only can this encourage people to aim for notoriety just for the sake of it (think Elizabeth Holmes), but it makes the rest of us believe that correlation (of those outliers) is causation; in other words, success of those individuals is due to their offbeat ways. But here’s another storyline: the most sure and therefore the <em>best</em> way to “success” is through consistency.</p><blockquote><em>“Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.”</em> - James Clear, <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a></blockquote><p>To be clear, consistency isn’t necessarily the easiest way to success, but one that can be achieved with a higher level of certainty, rather than hoping for a lottery win or someone to “discover” you. Continuous effort is a more thoughtful approach that leads to greatness when the following statements are true:</p><ol><li>Inputs are consistent over time</li><li>Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs</li></ol><h3 id="consistency">Consistency<br></h3><blockquote><em>“No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich”</em> - <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fcnn4K">Outliers</a></blockquote><p>There is a famous saying from Napolean Hill which says, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way”</em>. I would actually argue the quote should be, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times”.</em></p><p>If you don’t have the opportunity to “do great things”, focus on consistently achieving small wins. These small things in fact do not need to be done in a great way, but a good way, repeatably. In fact, I would advise not to focus on perfection, as it is often the enemy of the successful. </p><p>There’s glimmer and hoopla around unpredictability, but in reality, it’s much more difficult and therefore impressive, to be predictably good. For example:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to wake up whenever you “feel like it”. </li><li>It’s hard to stick to a routine of getting up at 6AM.</li><li>It’s easy to pivot from side project to side project, focusing on the new shiny object of the month.</li><li>It’s hard to stick with a side project for years, many of which may not be profitable for a long while. </li><li>It’s easy to give up on someone when you hit a roadblock or the next potential partner becomes available. </li><li>It’s hard to be faithful and invest in a relationship for decades.</li></ul><p>We normally set out in life with good intentions. We <em>intend</em> to set a morning routine or work on a business until it's profitable or to “love someone forever”. We imagine that as we invest in something, we will naturally continue to move in the right direction. If anything, things will get easier, right?</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NQV_7RXfM2ZYDJsT4E4JAaAW2i9KphrB7-fE8XveJlrW-Msf1aIot9ayls-wSCWIroq155Fzdz6vE3d8br71E6Tc5sTQRyhnT0Zb6EJCUoV41B5EoZSczjtWcHo9KV-T9c6s16Cb"></figure><p>The described trajectory is what we perceive on the left. Predictable, linear, and a direct reflection of effort put in. </p><p><strong>Rarely does success in anything look like that.</strong> Life is a series of tiny nodes that tend to look more like the right hand side. There two key elements worth calling out in the more realistic graph on the right:</p><ul><li>Compounding is always present. The earlier steps in any process will be more strenuous, yet it’s difficult to imagine the potential compounding that comes later on. </li><li>With the ups, there are always downs. This seems obvious, but we often forget this when we are in periods of down. We quit at these local minimums (the highlighted sections in red above), because we cannot see the next peak right around the corner. </li></ul><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>a friend just emailed me this note in response to my 'burn out' video. wanted to share;</p><p>'the addiction to having success is what makes you feel unsuccessful at the times when you're not feeling the immediate dopamine hit of your work 'succeeding' at that precise moment.'</p></div>— Casey Neistat (@Casey) <a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1093520669286064133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have lost our ability to appreciate delayed gratification and, some of us who struggle with perfectionism, can either create repeatedly until we ‘get it right’ never truly feeling fulfilled with our work, or, we avoid creating all together in fear of failing.</p>— Marcio Novelli (@MarcioNovelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcioNovelli/status/1093522120536150017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The local minima are especially psychologically taxing due to something called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a> or hedonic adaptation. Essentially, as someone achieves new successes in various aspects of their lives, their baseline shifts to reflect that new level and therefore, their expectations and desires are re-established as well. There is no net gain in happiness and thus, it becomes even more difficult to stay “level-headed” during these down moments. </p><p>That is exactly why a specific search for success can be problematic and instead of looking for unsustainable shortcuts in life, it’s much more effective (and healthy) to aim for continuous habits that bring you success as a byproduct, not as the end goal.</p><blockquote><em>“The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear</em></blockquote><p>On your journey to greatness, you need to fall in love with the process which includes many local minima and maxima. Staying consistent and pushing through both of these continuously is what will truly differentiate you from those that are simply “good” and isolate you as one of the few that are “great’.</p><h3 id="inputs-outputs">Inputs → Outputs</h3><p>The second important aspect of achieving greatness is acting with intention. Your actions and results will not always reflect your intentions, but as you move towards “greatness”, you should have a better idea of what inputs actually deliver output. You’ll still make mistakes﹣as we all do﹣but you’ll have a better grasp on what is more likely to work out. For example, your success rate may be 30%, versus someone flying blind with a 5% success rate. </p><p>Let’s look at a simple example:</p><p>Imagine company X has two sales people. Salesperson A happens to land a $1M deal in his first week. However, he struggles to land anything substantial for the next 6 months. Meanwhile, salesperson B manages to develop a process over the first month, bringing in only $100k which he’s able to scale up and double month over month.</p><p>After six months, this will be the revenue generated by each party.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/05/image-5.png"></figure><p>You’re probably thinking… "So what? That’s just a classic example of compounding." </p><p>Yes! That’s exactly the point. The best things in life often aren’t miracles, but well-thought out approaches that are sustainable. The same thing is true with businesses, marriages, and just about anything with repeatable elements.

    <p>To capture your ideas and turn them into tangible products, mind mapping software is a must. During the brainstorming process, ideas happen quickly, and if not appropriately tracked, can become overwhelming.
There are many reasons that mind mapping software is the best solution for this. To fully understand the benefit it can provide to your organization, it’s best to explore the concept of mind mapping and how it helps bring projects to life.</p>

<h2>The concept of mind mapping</h2>
<p>The concept of mind mapping stems from extracting useful ideas and developing links between them. During the brainstorming process ideas flow freely, but sometimes connections are not immediately noticeable. This makes the process of putting these ideas together and creating plan for an entire project extremely difficult. This is where mind mapping plays a critical role.</p>
<p>The best way to describe a mind map is a hierarchical tree is it shows a natural progression between ideas. A mind map separates a project into modular components and then breaks those down into even more specific tasks.</p>
<h2>What is mind mapping software?</h2>
<p>Although mind-mapping is possible by hand, utilizing mind mapping software is a modern and more refined way to get the job done. Utilizing these mind mapping tools enables a project leader to visualize and build out their projects. Generating a mind map by hand can take quite a bit of time, so specialized mind mapping apps condense the process and streamline delivery.</p>
<h2>Best mind mapping software to improve your productivity</h2>
<p>Within the software world, many mind mapping solutions exist. It isn’t difficult to find software for any platform, including the cloud.

<h2>How to pick a mind map tool</h2>
<p>To pick the best mind mapping tool for your unique situation, there are a few factors that should be considered. Depending on your individual needs, you may find that some software lacks a few essential items that are critical for your purposes.
Here are the major factors that should play into your decision.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Team access</h3>
    <p>If you are working on a project that requires multiple team members to access mind maps and edit them simultaneously, you’ll need to consider this. Some mind mapping software does not allow for real-time editing, although it’s supported in most. If you need this feature, then consider Miro or Coggle.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>More than mind maps</h3>
    <p>If you plan on doing more than just mind-mapping for your project, you’ll need to keep this in mind when picking a mind mapping software. While all of the aforementioned software is excellent for mind mapping, some options stand out and are exemplary for other tasks and different diagram types. Mind Meister and Coggle allow for unparalleled customization of charts.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>If you intend to integrate your mind maps into social media or utilize existing technologies—such as Google Drive or Microsoft 365—you’ll need to make sure it’s supported with the mind mapping software you choose. Two excellent options for this are Mindmup and Miro.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
    <p>You’ll also need to consider which platforms are supported by each type of mind mapping software. If your organization is primarily Apple-based, you’ll need to select mind mapping software compatible with Mac. Your best bet is to choose an option that is cloud-based so it works across all platforms and devices.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Budget</h3>
    <p>Your last consideration will be your budget for mind mapping software. If you have a complex set of projects that need many detailed diagrams, you’ll need to make sure that you select a software option that fits with your budget and allows you the mind maps you need.</p>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there are many different types of mind mapping software available that fit a variety of needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so it’s best to make a list of your needs, and then start shopping to find the mind mapping software for you.
A great place to start would be to select a few of the options that offer free plans, and start creating a mind map focused on selecting the best mind mapping software. This will give you a real-world view of the features so you can select the software solution that’s right for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>freespaceDAO</strong>  — hacking culture started in Hamburg and spawned the largest hackerspace for decades — citywide gentrification has cast out people and spaces for free thinking. The goal was to learn how a DAO could be useful in realigning incentives to allow these elements in society to recreate the spaces they lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>forestDAO</strong>  — if a forest could enlist agents to further its own means of survival— how would that look like? This raised the question of on-chain identity and whether a forest is sufficiently represented by encoding it in the incentive and governance structure of a DAO.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>poliDAO —</strong>  a multi-party system is great but even then raising attention (and funds) for grassroots movements that are small and localized remains inefficient not very scalable. Also, first-movers inside small grassroots movements often happen to hold more power than they might have to.<br>
It is this case that has been taken further and is now being actively studied for green grassroots movement in eastern Hamburg.</p>

		<div><p>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified
a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it'd be
thrown out, so I guess we're moving out of the office<sup id="fnref:moving-out"><a href="#fn:moving-out">1</a></sup>. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8
months later, most people haven't been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in
early March.</p>

<p>Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I miss having a clean delineation between "work" and "home".</p>
<p>I miss having copious desk space and a big monitor<sup id="fnref:house"><a href="#fn:house">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I miss the 48" TVs on the wall showing Grafana dashboards with key metrics so there was always ambient knowledge of
what was going on with the product.</p>
<p>I miss having meetings in conference rooms where you can see other people and have a giant whiteboard to sketch on.</p>
<p>I miss casual collaboration. Video chat is a poor substitute and Slack is a deeply irritating tool that combines the
worst aspects of synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>I miss productivity! Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone
working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can <em>ever</em> be as productive as in-person teams.</p>
<p>I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of
shifting those costs to me.</p>
<p>I miss having a plethora of convenient and delicious options for take-out lunch! I miss the gyros and french fries
at <a href="https://www.ayolagreek.com/">Ayola</a>. I miss the chicken pesto sandwich at <a href="https://working-girls-cafe.square.site/">Working Girls'
Cafe</a>. I miss the chow mein and pork buns from <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a>. I
miss the katsu curry from <a href="http://www.muraccis.com/">Muracci's</a>. I miss the curry burritos from <a href="https://www.curryupnow.com/">Curry Up
Now</a>. I miss the croque monsieur from <a href="https://cafemadeleinesf.com/">Cafe Madeline</a>. I
miss the $5 lunch specials from <a href="http://www.mehfilindian.com/">Mehfil</a>.</p>
<p>I miss the succession of friendly baristas at our <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hermanos-coffee-juice-san-francisco">favorite coffee shop</a> who always knew our orders and put up with our banter.</p>
<p>I miss occasional after-work drinks at the <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/4/25/18516128/skydeck-spirits-in-the-sky-rooftop-bar-san-francisco">sky bar</a> with the $18 well drinks that we always convinced management to pay for.</p>
<p>Hell, I miss <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> in all its loud and smelly glory.</p>
<p>Look, I know, it's not all bad. It's a lot easier taking care of a baby while working from home than it would be if
I were commuting 45 minutes each way every day. I'm spending a lot less money on food and coffee and BART. And I'm
not arguing that we should be in the office now; not a single one of those things I listed above is worth the health
risk of jamming 150 people<sup id="fnref:deniers"><a href="#fn:deniers">3</a></sup> into an open-plan office with a quasi-functional ventilation
system<sup id="fnref:ventilation"><a href="#fn:ventilation">4</a></sup>. But I
really hope that office-work isn't a permanent victim of this pandemic, that all the companies pushing for
permanent WFH to save a few bucks on rent reconsider their stances, and that there comes a time when I can go back to
work again.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2015, I gave a talk in which I called <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skade/tex-the-ultimate-yakshave">Donald Knuth the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves</a>. The reason is that Donald Knuth achieved the most perfect and long-running yak shave: TeX.</p>
<p>I figured this is worth repeating.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achieve-the-ultimate-yak-shave">How to achieve the ultimate Yak Shave</h2>
<p>The ultimate yak shave is the combination of improbable circumstance, the privilege to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine, inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that everyone always tells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s get things started.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-shave">The Pre-Shave</h2>
<p>TeX was invented to typeset a book. No plural. It was invented to typeset the second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition, was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.</p>
<p>But “The Art of Computer Programming” is an impressive book in its own right: it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished, but the first chapters are released). It was called a book of the century by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science">American scientist writers</a>.</p>
<p>Yak shave -2: Write a book of the century</p>
<p>Digging deeper into TAOCP, it already shows the works of a yak shaver destined for greater things. All programs in this book refer to a common assembly language: MIX. Which was invented for the book.</p>
<p>Yak shave -1: Invent your own computer for illustration purposes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first version of TeX was implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)">SAIL</a> programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yak shave 1: Somewhere along the road, implement your own programming language…</p>
<p>WEB is a special language: in WEB, any bare text is just text. It’s interleaved with marked pieces of code, which are later used for the program code. The documentation can be run through a special program to produce… a TeX file. The concept is called “literate programming” and was introduced by… Donald Knuth.</p>
<p>Yak shave 2: Invent your own programming paradigm for it</p>
<p>But, what does TeX do? Mainly, it does text layout and a couple of other things. Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”, the whitespace between words). Here’s a <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf">nice explanation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still considered good and has a huge factor in the recognisable look of TeX documents.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the next problem: <em>what</em> does this thing lay out? Generically speaking: objects and clusters of objects of varying sizes. Interestingly, that’s what TeX deals with, it has no concept of a character other then dimensions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are usually characters and characters are provided by fonts. Fonts must usually be licensed at a fee and free fonts weren’t so available in the 70s.</p>
<p>Another very recognisable feature of TeX documents that they are often set in a font called “Computer Modern”.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make this whole thing a bit more thrilling, so I will let you guess who created that one.</p>
<p>Yak shave 4: Design a font</p>
<p>Fonts need to be authored. Usually, they are described in some vector description, often Bézier curves. This is fairly standard and not an innovation of Knuth. <em>But</em>, he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this descriptions into proper font files. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>. It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.</p>
<p>Yak shave 5: Write an authoring tool for fonts</p>
<p>As a side-note, METAFONT was later evolved into METAPOST for generic vector drawings, which has the one feature I still miss from many modern graphics description languages: the ability to describe an (addressable) point as the intersection between two other primitives.</p>
<p>Another side-note: both TeX and METAFONT still see releases, at a slow pace. TeX is currently at version 3.14159265, METAFONT at 2.7182818. Yep, TeX is slowly converging towards pi, while METAFONT towards e. Take that, semantic versioning advocates!</p>
<p>Yak shave 6: Come up with your own versioning scheme<br>
Yak shave 7: Avoid adoption of it for greater good</p>
<p>We’re not done yet. We can layout text (and other things), but where do we convert it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format">DVI</a>, the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver, which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was designed by…</p>
<p>David R. Fuchs, Knuth just wrote the implementation.</p>
<p>Yak shave 8: Implement a custom language for printable documents</p>
<p>Note that I haven’t mentioned that TeX is an… interesting… language by itself, but I don’t consider that a yak shave, this was just the implementation.</p>
<p>That makes most of the initial implementation complete. Which means, in orderly fashion, you should give matters in the hand of the community.</p>

<p>Since the release of TeX, the community has been busy working on using it as a platform. If you ever downloaded the full TeX distribution, please bear in mind that you are downloading the amassed work of over 40 years, to make sure that each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents here.</p>
<p>But mostly, two big projects sprung out of that. The first is LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms. LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which is far more focused on fine grained layout control.</p>
<p>Both share a common property:</p>
<p>Community yak shave 1: Create not one, but two programs that are very ungoogleable… Before Google is invented.</p>
<p>Being active in a language that has lingo built around “Rust”, “Cargo” and “manifests”, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Now, the community also wants to evolve TeX: a lot has changed over the years in technology, so, for example, you’d like to use modern font formats, directly write to modern output formats or use this new UTF-8 thingy. For that, there are specialised TeX interpreters, such as <code>pdf(la)tex</code>, <code>lua(la)tex</code> and <code>xe(la)tex</code>. There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License">it under that name</a>. The thinking here is that if you have a <code>tex</code> binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from the future.</p>
<p>The first issue on that road is that WEB isn’t really a popular programming language, neither is PASCAL and running it on modern systems is a bit of a pain. Which means…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 2: Transpile WEB to C and work from there</p>
<p>This is just the start of a great endeavour…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 3: Build a lot of tooling around that</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel like “can’t we just replace this whole thing, it can’t be so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the <em>most</em> popular knowledge around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.</p>
<p>TeX is also not a programming language. It might resemble one, but mostly, it should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo gets much better then. It’s not programming lingo.</p>
<p>By approaching TeX with an understanding for its history, a lot of things can be learned from it. And yes, a replacement would be great, but it would take ages.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope I thoroughly convinced you why Donald Knuth is the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves.</p>

<p>This comes out of a enjoyable discussion with <a href="https://lambdaisland.com/">Arne from Lambda Island</a>, who listened and said “you should totally turn this into a talk”.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>

  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2>Public Notice of Sale: CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company – Auction of 191,075 lbs. of St. Louis Style Ribs</h2>
<p>CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company (“CBQ”) is offering for sale pursuant to 810 Ill. Comp. Ann. 5/2-706 approximately 191,075 lbs. of frozen St. Louis Style ribs. CBQ advises that it is selling the ribs because Canadian American Boxed Meat Corp. refused to return the purchase price after CBQ revoked its acceptance of the ribs. CBQ advises it revoked its acceptance because the ribs contained metal particles from rusted, galvanized steel and 400-series steel. The ribs are located at 15600 Wentworth Ave., South Holland, IL 60473. The CBQ is selling the ribs “as-is” “where-is” with no warranties or representations of any kind. Prospective purchasers may inspect samples of the ribs at the above location by contacting Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="3b4b5e4f5e49567b594e5f5f525c1558545615">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Prospective purchasers may submit bids by emailing them to Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e393869786918ea3819687878a84cd808c8e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> on or before November 27, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. All bids must be firm offers and must provide for payment in immediately available funds, FOB at the address above within 3 business days of acceptance.

                <p>Most styles are editable through <em>CSS variables</em>. You can also add your own styles
                    inline, at the end of MVP.css or in a new stylesheet.</p>
                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> If there are two conflicting CSS styles, the last one will take precedence.</p>
                <pre>                    <code>
:root {
    --color: #118bee;
}

/* Lower in the CSS, or in a 2nd stylesheet */

:root {
    --color: green; /* This will take precedence */
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I still don't like it?</summary>
                <p>That's OK, you probably shouldn't love your MVP. The goal of MVP.css is to help you
                    feel <i>slightly</i> less embarrased about it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieve.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> is a famous mathematical figure which presents an interesting computer science problem: how to go about generating it. In this article I'll explain one method of generating the Sierpinski triangle recursively, with an implementation written in Vanilla JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. I'll also explain how to you'd go about downloading the contents of an HTML5 Canvas element as a PNG.</p>
<p>First, here's what the Sierpinski triangle looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="The Sierpinski Triangle"></p>
<h2>What is the Sierpinski Triangle?</h2>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle is a Fractal, Making it Naturally Recursive</h3>
<p>One initial thing to notice about the Sierpinski triangle is that every triangle is composed of smaller, identical triangles. Those triangles are also made up of even smaller, identical triangles, which are also made up of more triangles, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/fractal.jpg" alt="Sierpinski Triangle Fractal"></p>
<p>This property in which the Sierpinski triangle is made up of identical, scaled-down copies of itself makes it a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html">fractal</a> in mathematics. Fractals are shapes that are made up of scaled down copies of themselves. The Sierpinski triangle is actually arguably one of the most famous fractals that exist, along with <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagorasTree.html">Pythagoras Trees</a>, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html">the Mandelbrot set</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The fact that fractals are made up of copies of themselves makes them naturally recursive, and it tends to be simpler to programmatically generate fractals recursively as supposed to using an iterative approach.</p>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle Only Uses Equilateral Triangles</h3>
<p>Next, notice how the Sierpinski triangle is made up of a single shape: the equilateral triangle. This is not a coincidence, and it is in fact one of the reasons the Sierpinski triangle is a notable mathematical figure.</p>
<p>The Sierpinski triangle takes advantage of a property of equilateral triangles: that they are one of the only shapes that can be made up solely by scaled down versions of itself, where a large equilateral triangle can be made by tesselating four equally smaller equilateral triangles. This makes them uniquely positioned to be the centerpiece of simple fractals, since it is intuitive to encompass smaller copies of an equilateral triangle inside a larger one.</p>
<p>This also makes it possible for fractals based on equilateral triangles, like the Sierpinski triangle, to be composed of only one shape. Other polygon-based fractals that don't use equilateral triangles often include several different shapes.</p>
<h2>Generating the Sierpinski Triangle in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas</h2>
<h3>Setting Up the HTML and Canvas Element</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up the <code>canvas</code> element and basic HTML markup:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sierpinski Triangle&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="1000" height="1000"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

    &lt;!-- JavaScript Code Here --&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the width and height variables in the canvas represent the inner dimensions of the canvas, not necessarily its size on the page. This means it can be resized in the future to fit different screen sizes, while maintaining its inner dimensions of 1000px by 1000px.</p>
<h3>Creating Equilateral Triangles on the Canvas in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Since equilateral triangles are the only shape used in the Sierpinski triangle, it makes sense to write a utility function to draw a given equilateral triangle on the canvas at a specified position and of a specified size.</p>
<p>This function will take in two arguments: the position of the bottom left vertex on the triangle (<code>pos</code>), and the length of the sides of the triangle (<code>sidelen</code>).</p>
<p>To create polygons in HTML5 canvas, there are several functions to move to positions on the canvas, draw a path around an area of the canvas, and fill in that area. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>context.beginPath()</code> and <code>context.closePath()</code> — create and close a path; commonly used with <code>context.fill()</code> after closing the path</li>
<li><code>context.moveTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>context.lineTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas while drawing a line from the current position.</li>
<li><code>context.fill()</code> — fill the most recent canvas path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a triangle simply means identifying the positions of the three vertices, drawing a path around those vertices, and filling the drawn area with a color. Identifying the positions of the vertices is pretty intuitive. Below is a visual showing the positions of the vertices. Note that the height of an equilateral triangle is mathematically equal to as <code>sin(Pi/3) * sidelen</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/equilateral-triangle.jpg" alt="Equilateral Triangle Vertex Positions"></p>
<p>With the positions of the vertices done, here's what the function to create an equilateral triangle on the canvas would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const c = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d"); // context variable is used to draw on a 2D plane

const createTriangle = (pos, sidelen) =&gt; {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(...pos); // go to the left vertex

  // note that (0,0) in canvas is the top left, so 'up' on the vertical component would use substraction.
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen / 2, pos[1] - sidelen * Math.sin(Math.PI/3)); // draw line from left vertex to top vertex
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen, pos[1]); // draw line from top vertex to right vertex
  ctx.lineTo(...pos); // draw line from right vertex back to left vertex
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.fill(); // fill triangle
};</code></pre>
<h3>Implementing an Algorithm to Generate the Sierpinski Triangle</h3>
<p>Now that the canvas and HTML has been set up and the <code>createTriangle</code> utility function has been written, we can start implementing an algorithm to generate the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
<p>Since fractals are naturally recursive, we'll use a recursive approach to generate the entire triangle.</p>
<p>First, recall that every triangle in the Sierpinski triangle is made up of three smaller triangles, one on the left, another on the right, and a final one on the top. Each smaller triangle is a copy of the outer triangle, the Sierpinski triangle. So, simply create a smaller Sierpinski triangle inside of each of the three triangles, and then more smaller Sierpinski triangles inside of those, and so on. Technically, the Sierpinski triangle repeats forever, but for visualizations like this, a stopping point should be defined when there have been enough repeats that the smallest triangles are hard to make out. At this point, filling in the smallest triangles acts as an effective substitution of repeating further.</p>
<p>To create this stopping condition, a variable called <code>depth</code> can be used. <code>depth</code> would represent the amount of times the program should continue repeating the fractal. <code>depth</code> should start at a certain value and decrease for every repeat, and every smaller Sierpinski triangle created. Once <code>depth</code> reaches zero (the base case), the program would stop and fill in the three triangles instead of continuing to repeat the fractal.</p>
<p>To create this functionality, let's create a function called <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> which takes the position of the Sierpinski triangle to generate, its side length, and the depth. The function should identify the positions of the three inner triangles, draw them if depth is equal to zero, or call <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> on the three inner triangles if the depth is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const createSierpinskiTriangle = (pos, sidelen, depth) =&gt; {
  const innerTriangleSidelen = sidelen / 2; // side length of inner triangles is half the side length of the outer triangle
  const innerTrianglesPositions = [
    pos,
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen, pos[1] ],
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen / 2, pos[1] - Math.sin(Math.PI/3) * innerTriangleSidelen ]
  ]; // these positions are the same as what was used in the createTriangle function
  if(depth == 0) {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen);
    });
  } else {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createSierpinskiTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen, depth - 1);
    });
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>To call the function, draw the Sierpinski triangle at the bottom left of the canvas (<code>(0, 1000)</code>) with a side length of <code>1000</code>px (the width of the canvas) and a depth of <code>5</code>.</p>
<pre><code>createSierpinskiTriangle([0, 1000], 1000, 5);</code></pre>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="Recursive Method Result"></p>
<p>Try increasing the depth, and you should see that the triangle gets more and more detailed. Increasing the depth by one will result in three times the amount of total triangles to be drawn, so very high depths like 20 might not be performant since the canvas would have to draw 3^20 (~3.5 billion) triangles.</p>
<h3>Downloading the Generated Triangle From the Canvas as a PNG</h3>
<p>Now that we've generated the triangle recursively, one thing you may want to do is download the generated Sierpinski triangle as an image on your computer. Luckily, this is very simple to do in HTML5 Canvas.</p>
<p>First, the canvas must be converted to a data URL. If you're not familiar with data URLs, here's a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A data URL is a URL scheme that allows data and files (images, audio files, etc.) to be respresented in a single URL containing all of the data. For example, if one wanted to include an image on a website, you would add the image to the web server and link to it in the HTML. With data URLs, the data URL contains the contents of the entire file, so it can simply be put into the HTML directly. This is useful in canvas because we want to export the image without it having a specific public URL, and data URLs allow that to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contents of the <code>canvas</code> element can be converted to a data URL with the <code>.toDataURL</code> method.</p>
<p>Next, let's download the data URL into the user's machine. In HTML, downloading a file is done by clicking a link and specifying the <code>download</code> attribute. For example, here's how someone would download an image as <code>myimage.png</code> when the user clicks a link: <code>&lt;a href="image.png" download="myimage.png"&gt;download!&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Downloading a file through JavaScript is as simple as creating a link element with the specified <code>href</code> and <code>download</code> attributes, and artificially clicking on it.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const downloadCanvasContents = () =&gt; {
  const link = …</code></pre></div></div>
